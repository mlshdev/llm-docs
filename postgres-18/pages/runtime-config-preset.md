# Preset Options

The following “parameters” are read-only. As such, they have been excluded from the sample `postgresql.conf` file. These options report various aspects of PostgreSQL behavior that might be of interest to certain applications, particularly administrative front-ends. Most of them are determined when PostgreSQL is compiled or when it is installed.

**`block_size` (`integer`)**

  Reports the size of a disk block. It is determined by the value of `BLCKSZ` when building the server. The default value is 8192 bytes. The meaning of some configuration variables (such as [Resource Consumption](./runtime-config-resource.md#guc-shared-buffers)) is influenced by `block_size`. See [Resource Consumption](./runtime-config-resource.md) for information.

**`data_checksums` (`boolean`)**

  Reports whether data checksums are enabled for this cluster. See [initdb](./app-initdb.md#app-initdb-data-checksums) for more information.

**`data_directory_mode` (`integer`)**

  On Unix systems this parameter reports the permissions the data directory (defined by [File Locations](./runtime-config-file-locations.md#guc-data-directory)) had at server startup. (On Microsoft Windows this parameter will always display `0700`.) See [the `initdb` `-g` option](./app-initdb.md#app-initdb-allow-group-access) for more information.

**`debug_assertions` (`boolean`)**

  Reports whether PostgreSQL has been built with assertions enabled. That is the case if the macro `USE_ASSERT_CHECKING` is defined when PostgreSQL is built (accomplished e.g., by the `configure` option `--enable-cassert`). By default PostgreSQL is built without assertions.

**`huge_pages_status` (`enum`)**

  Reports the state of huge pages in the current instance: `on`, `off`, or `unknown` (if displayed with `postgres -C`). This parameter is useful to determine whether allocation of huge pages was successful under `huge_pages=try`. See [Resource Consumption](./runtime-config-resource.md#guc-huge-pages) for more information.

**`integer_datetimes` (`boolean`)**

  Reports whether PostgreSQL was built with support for 64-bit-integer dates and times. As of PostgreSQL 10, this is always `on`.

**`in_hot_standby` (`boolean`)**

  Reports whether the server is currently in hot standby mode. When this is `on`, all transactions are forced to be read-only. Within a session, this can change only if the server is promoted to be primary. See [Hot Standby](./hot-standby.md) for more information.

**`max_function_args` (`integer`)**

  Reports the maximum number of function arguments. It is determined by the value of `FUNC_MAX_ARGS` when building the server. The default value is 100 arguments.

**`max_identifier_length` (`integer`)**

  Reports the maximum identifier length. It is determined as one less than the value of `NAMEDATALEN` when building the server. The default value of `NAMEDATALEN` is 64; therefore the default `max_identifier_length` is 63 bytes, which can be less than 63 characters when using multibyte encodings.

**`max_index_keys` (`integer`)**

  Reports the maximum number of index keys. It is determined by the value of `INDEX_MAX_KEYS` when building the server. The default value is 32 keys.

**`num_os_semaphores` (`integer`)**

  Reports the number of semaphores that are needed for the server based on the configured number of allowed connections ([Connections and Authentication](./runtime-config-connection.md#guc-max-connections)), allowed autovacuum worker processes ([Vacuuming](./runtime-config-vacuum.md#guc-autovacuum-max-workers)), allowed WAL sender processes ([Replication](./runtime-config-replication.md#guc-max-wal-senders)), allowed background processes ([Resource Consumption](./runtime-config-resource.md#guc-max-worker-processes)), etc.

**`segment_size` (`integer`)**

  Reports the number of blocks (pages) that can be stored within a file segment. It is determined by the value of `RELSEG_SIZE` when building the server. The maximum size of a segment file in bytes is equal to `segment_size` multiplied by `block_size`; by default this is 1GB.

**`server_encoding` (`string`)**

  Reports the database encoding (character set). It is determined when the database is created. Ordinarily, clients need only be concerned with the value of [Client Connection Defaults](./runtime-config-client.md#guc-client-encoding).

**`server_version` (`string`)**

  Reports the version number of the server. It is determined by the value of `PG_VERSION` when building the server.

**`server_version_num` (`integer`)**

  Reports the version number of the server as an integer. It is determined by the value of `PG_VERSION_NUM` when building the server.

**`shared_memory_size` (`integer`)**

  Reports the size of the main shared memory area, rounded up to the nearest megabyte.

**`shared_memory_size_in_huge_pages` (`integer`)**

  Reports the number of huge pages that are needed for the main shared memory area based on the specified [Resource Consumption](./runtime-config-resource.md#guc-huge-page-size). If huge pages are not supported, this will be `-1`.

  This setting is supported only on Linux. It is always set to `-1` on other platforms. For more details about using huge pages on Linux, see [Linux Huge Pages](./kernel-resources.md#linux-huge-pages).

**`ssl_library` (`string`)**

  Reports the name of the SSL library that this PostgreSQL server was built with (even if SSL is not currently configured or in use on this instance), for example `OpenSSL`, or an empty string if none.

**`wal_block_size` (`integer`)**

  Reports the size of a WAL disk block. It is determined by the value of `XLOG_BLCKSZ` when building the server. The default value is 8192 bytes.

**`wal_segment_size` (`integer`)**

  Reports the size of write ahead log segments. The default value is 16MB. See [WAL Configuration](./wal-configuration.md) for more information.
