# role_udt_grants

The view `role_udt_grants` is intended to identify `USAGE` privileges granted on user-defined types where the grantor or grantee is a currently enabled role. Further information can be found under `udt_privileges`. The only effective difference between this view and `udt_privileges` is that this view omits objects that have been made accessible to the current user by way of a grant to `PUBLIC`. Since data types do not have real privileges in PostgreSQL, but only an implicit grant to `PUBLIC`, this view is empty.
