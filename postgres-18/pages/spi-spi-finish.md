# SPI_finish

disconnect a C function from the SPI manager

## Synopsis

```
int SPI_finish(void)
```

## Description

`SPI_finish` closes an existing connection to the SPI manager. You must call this function after completing the SPI operations needed during your C function's current invocation. You do not need to worry about making this happen, however, if you abort the transaction via `elog(ERROR)`. In that case SPI will clean itself up automatically.

## Return Value

**`SPI_OK_FINISH`**

  if properly disconnected

**`SPI_ERROR_UNCONNECTED`**

  if called from an unconnected C function
