# pg_statistic_ext

The catalog `pg_statistic_ext` holds definitions of extended planner statistics. Each row in this catalog corresponds to a *statistics object* created with [`CREATE STATISTICS`](./sql-createstatistics.md).

**pg_statistic_ext Columns**

`oid` `oid`

Row identifier

---

`stxrelid` `oid` (references [`pg_class`](./catalog-pg-class.md).`oid`)

Table containing the columns described by this object

---

`stxname` `name`

Name of the statistics object

---

`stxnamespace` `oid` (references [`pg_namespace`](./catalog-pg-namespace.md).`oid`)

The OID of the namespace that contains this statistics object

---

`stxowner` `oid` (references [`pg_authid`](./catalog-pg-authid.md).`oid`)

Owner of the statistics object

---

`stxkeys` `int2vector` (references [`pg_attribute`](./catalog-pg-attribute.md).`attnum`)

An array of attribute numbers, indicating which table columns are covered by this statistics object; for example a value of `1 3` would mean that the first and the third table columns are covered

---

`stxstattarget` `int2`

`stxstattarget` controls the level of detail of statistics accumulated for this statistics object by [`ANALYZE`](./sql-analyze.md). A zero value indicates that no statistics should be collected. A null value says to use the maximum of the statistics targets of the referenced columns, if set, or the system default statistics target. Positive values of `stxstattarget` determine the target number of “most common values” to collect.

---

`stxkind` `char[]`

An array containing codes for the enabled statistics kinds; valid values are: `d` for n-distinct statistics, `f` for functional dependency statistics, `m` for most common values (MCV) list statistics, and `e` for expression statistics

---

`stxexprs` `pg_node_tree`

Expression trees (in `nodeToString()` representation) for statistics object attributes that are not simple column references. This is a list with one element per expression. Null if all statistics object attributes are simple references.

The `pg_statistic_ext` entry is filled in completely during [`CREATE STATISTICS`](./sql-createstatistics.md), but the actual statistical values are not computed then. Subsequent [`ANALYZE`](./sql-analyze.md) commands compute the desired values and populate an entry in the [`pg_statistic_ext_data`](./catalog-pg-statistic-ext-data.md) catalog.
