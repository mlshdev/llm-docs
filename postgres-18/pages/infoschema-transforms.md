# transforms

The view `transforms` contains information about the transforms defined in the current database. More precisely, it contains a row for each function contained in a transform (the “from SQL” or “to SQL” function).

**transforms Columns**

`udt_catalog` `sql_identifier`

Name of the database that contains the type the transform is for (always the current database)

---

`udt_schema` `sql_identifier`

Name of the schema that contains the type the transform is for

---

`udt_name` `sql_identifier`

Name of the type the transform is for

---

`specific_catalog` `sql_identifier`

Name of the database containing the function (always the current database)

---

`specific_schema` `sql_identifier`

Name of the schema containing the function

---

`specific_name` `sql_identifier`

The “specific name” of the function. See [routines](./infoschema-routines.md) for more information.

---

`group_name` `sql_identifier`

The SQL standard allows defining transforms in “groups”, and selecting a group at run time. PostgreSQL does not support this. Instead, transforms are specific to a language. As a compromise, this field contains the language the transform is for.

---

`transform_type` `character_data`

`FROM SQL` or `TO SQL`
