# The SQL Language

This part describes the use of the SQL language in PostgreSQL. We start with describing the general syntax of SQL, then how to create tables, how to populate the database, and how to query it. The middle part lists the available data types and functions for use in SQL commands. Lastly, we address several aspects of importance for tuning a database.

The information is arranged so that a novice user can follow it from start to end and gain a full understanding of the topics without having to refer forward too many times. The chapters are intended to be self-contained, so that advanced users can read the chapters individually as they choose. The information is presented in narrative form with topical units. Readers looking for a complete description of a particular command are encouraged to review the [Reference](./reference.md).

Readers should know how to connect to a PostgreSQL database and issue SQL commands. Readers that are unfamiliar with these issues are encouraged to read [Tutorial](./tutorial.md) first. SQL commands are typically entered using the PostgreSQL interactive terminal `psql`, but other programs that have similar functionality can be used as well.
