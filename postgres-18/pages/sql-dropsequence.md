# DROP SEQUENCE

remove a sequence

## Synopsis

```
DROP SEQUENCE [ IF EXISTS ] name [, ...] [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]
```

## Description

`DROP SEQUENCE` removes sequence number generators. A sequence can only be dropped by its owner or a superuser.

## Parameters

**`IF EXISTS`**

  Do not throw an error if the sequence does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.

**`name`**

  The name (optionally schema-qualified) of a sequence.

**`CASCADE`**

  Automatically drop objects that depend on the sequence, and in turn all objects that depend on those objects (see [Dependency Tracking](./ddl-depend.md)).

**`RESTRICT`**

  Refuse to drop the sequence if any objects depend on it. This is the default.

## Examples

To remove the sequence `serial`:

```sql
DROP SEQUENCE serial;
```

## Compatibility

`DROP SEQUENCE` conforms to the SQL standard, except that the standard only allows one sequence to be dropped per command, and apart from the `IF EXISTS` option, which is a PostgreSQL extension.
