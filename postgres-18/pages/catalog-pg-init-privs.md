# pg_init_privs

The catalog `pg_init_privs` records information about the initial privileges of objects in the system. There is one entry for each object in the database which has a non-default (non-NULL) initial set of privileges.

Objects can have initial privileges either by having those privileges set when the system is initialized (by `initdb`) or when the object is created during a [`CREATE EXTENSION`](./sql-createextension.md) and the extension script sets initial privileges using the [`GRANT`](./sql-grant.md) system. Note that the system will automatically handle recording of the privileges during the extension script and that extension authors need only use the `GRANT` and `REVOKE` statements in their script to have the privileges recorded. The `privtype` column indicates if the initial privilege was set by `initdb` or during a `CREATE EXTENSION` command.

Objects which have initial privileges set by `initdb` will have entries where `privtype` is `'i'`, while objects which have initial privileges set by `CREATE EXTENSION` will have entries where `privtype` is `'e'`.

**pg_init_privs Columns**

`objoid` `oid` (references any OID column)

The OID of the specific object

---

`classoid` `oid` (references [`pg_class`](./catalog-pg-class.md).`oid`)

The OID of the system catalog the object is in

---

`objsubid` `int4`

For a table column, this is the column number (the `objoid` and `classoid` refer to the table itself). For all other object types, this column is zero.

---

`privtype` `char`

A code defining the type of initial privilege of this object; see text

---

`initprivs` `aclitem[]`

The initial access privileges; see [Privileges](./ddl-priv.md) for details
