# podman-pod-clone

## NAME

podman-pod-clone - Create a copy of an existing pod

## SYNOPSIS

**podman pod clone** \[*options*] *pod* *name*

## DESCRIPTION

**podman pod clone** creates a copy of a pod, recreating the identical config for the pod and for all of its containers. Users can modify the pods new name and select pod details within the infra container

## OPTIONS

#### **--blkio-weight**=*weight*

Block IO relative weight. The *weight* is a value between **10** and **1000**.

This option is not supported on cgroups V1 rootless systems.

#### **--blkio-weight-device**=*device:weight*

Block IO relative device weight.

#### **--cgroup-parent**=*path*

Path to cgroups under which the cgroup for the pod is created. If the
path is not absolute, the path is considered to be relative to the cgroups path
of the init process. Cgroups are created if they do not already exist.

#### **--cpu-shares**, **-c**=*shares*

CPU shares (relative weight).

By default, all containers get the same proportion of CPU cycles. This
proportion can be modified by changing the container's CPU share weighting
relative to the combined weight of all the running containers.
Default weight is **1024**.

The proportion only applies when CPU-intensive processes are running.
When tasks in one container are idle, other containers can use the
left-over CPU time. The actual amount of CPU time varies depending on
the number of containers running on the system.

For example, consider three containers, one has a cpu-share of 1024 and
two others have a cpu-share setting of 512. When processes in all three
containers attempt to use 100% of CPU, the first container receives
50% of the total CPU time. If a fourth container is added with a cpu-share
of 1024, the first container only gets 33% of the CPU. The remaining containers
receive 16.5%, 16.5% and 33% of the CPU.

On a multi-core system, the shares of CPU time are distributed over all CPU
cores. Even if a container is limited to less than 100% of CPU time, it can
use 100% of each individual CPU core.

For example, consider a system with more than three cores.
If the container *C0* is started with **--cpu-shares=512** running one process,
and another container *C1* with **--cpu-shares=1024** running two processes,
this can result in the following division of CPU shares:

| PID | container | CPU | CPU share    |
| --- | --------- | --- | ------------ |
| 100 | C0        | 0   | 100% of CPU0 |
| 101 | C1        | 1   | 100% of CPU1 |
| 102 | C1        | 2   | 100% of CPU2 |

On some systems, changing the resource limits may not be allowed for non-root
users. For more details, see
[https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/troubleshooting.md#26-running-containers-with-resource-limits-fails-with-a-permissions-error](https://github.com/podman-container-tools/podman/blob/8303f2e25b675ea7f82099d615c60969aec15870/troubleshooting.md#26-running-containers-with-resource-limits-fails-with-a-permissions-error)

This option is not supported on cgroups V1 rootless systems.

#### **--cpus**

Set a number of CPUs for the pod that overrides the original pods CPU limits. If none are specified, the original pod's Nano CPUs are used.

#### **--cpuset-cpus**=*number*

CPUs in which to allow execution. Can be specified as a comma-separated list
(e.g. **0,1**), as a range (e.g. **0-3**), or any combination thereof
(e.g. **0-3,7,11-15**).

On some systems, changing the resource limits may not be allowed for non-root
users. For more details, see
[https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/troubleshooting.md#26-running-containers-with-resource-limits-fails-with-a-permissions-error](https://github.com/podman-container-tools/podman/blob/8303f2e25b675ea7f82099d615c60969aec15870/troubleshooting.md#26-running-containers-with-resource-limits-fails-with-a-permissions-error)

This option is not supported on cgroups V1 rootless systems.

If none are specified, the original pod's CPUset is used.

#### **--cpuset-mems**=*nodes*

Memory nodes (MEMs) in which to allow execution (0-3, 0,1). Only effective on
NUMA systems.

If there are four memory nodes on the system (0-3), use **--cpuset-mems=0,1**
then processes in the container only uses memory from the first
two memory nodes.

On some systems, changing the resource limits may not be allowed for non-root
users. For more details, see
[https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/troubleshooting.md#26-running-containers-with-resource-limits-fails-with-a-permissions-error](https://github.com/podman-container-tools/podman/blob/8303f2e25b675ea7f82099d615c60969aec15870/troubleshooting.md#26-running-containers-with-resource-limits-fails-with-a-permissions-error)

This option is not supported on cgroups V1 rootless systems.

#### **--destroy**

Remove the original pod that we are cloning once used to mimic the configuration.

#### **--device**=*host-device\[:container-device]\[:permissions]*

Add a host device to the pod. The format of this is
`HOST-DEVICE[:CONTAINER-DEVICE][:PERMISSIONS]`, where `HOST-DEVICE` is the path of
the device node on the host, `CONTAINER-DEVICE` is the path of the device node in
the container, and `PERMISSIONS` is a list of permissions combining 'r' for read,
'w' for write, and 'm' for mknod(2).

Example: **--device=/dev/sdc:/dev/xvdc:rwm**.

Note: if *host-device* is a symbolic link then it is resolved first.
The pod only stores the major and minor numbers of the host device.

Podman may load kernel modules required for using the specified
device. The devices that Podman loads modules for when necessary are:
/dev/fuse.

In rootless mode, the new device is bind mounted in the container from the host
rather than Podman creating it within the container space. Because the bind
mount retains its SELinux label on SELinux systems, the container can get
permission denied when accessing the mounted device. Modify SELinux settings to
allow containers to use all device labels via the following command:

$ sudo setsebool -P  container\_use\_devices=true

Note: the pod implements devices by storing the initial configuration passed by the user and recreating the device on each container added to the pod.

#### **--device-read-bps**=*path:rate*

Limit read rate (in bytes per second) from a device (e.g. **--device-read-bps=/dev/sda:1mb**).

On some systems, changing the resource limits may not be allowed for non-root
users. For more details, see
[https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/troubleshooting.md#26-running-containers-with-resource-limits-fails-with-a-permissions-error](https://github.com/podman-container-tools/podman/blob/8303f2e25b675ea7f82099d615c60969aec15870/troubleshooting.md#26-running-containers-with-resource-limits-fails-with-a-permissions-error)

This option is not supported on cgroups V1 rootless systems.

#### **--device-write-bps**=*path:rate*

Limit write rate (in bytes per second) to a device (e.g. **--device-write-bps=/dev/sda:1mb**).

On some systems, changing the resource limits may not be allowed for non-root
users. For more details, see
[https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/troubleshooting.md#26-running-containers-with-resource-limits-fails-with-a-permissions-error](https://github.com/podman-container-tools/podman/blob/8303f2e25b675ea7f82099d615c60969aec15870/troubleshooting.md#26-running-containers-with-resource-limits-fails-with-a-permissions-error)

This option is not supported on cgroups V1 rootless systems.

#### **--gidmap**=*container\_gid:from\_gid\[:amount]*

Run all containers in the pod in a new user namespace using the supplied GID
mapping. This option conflicts with the **--userns** option. It provides a way
to map host GIDs to container GIDs. It can be passed several times to map
different ranges.

#### **--gpus**=*ENTRY*

Start the container with GPU support. Where `ENTRY` can be `all` to request all GPUs, or a vendor-specific identifier. Currently, NVIDIA and AMD devices are supported. If both NVIDIA and AMD devices are present, the NVIDIA devices will be preferred, and a CDI device name must be specified using the `--device` flag to request a set of GPUs from a *specific* vendor.

#### **--help**, **-h**

Print usage statement.

#### **--hostname**=*name*

Set the pod's hostname inside all containers.

The given hostname is also added to the `/etc/hosts` file using the container's
primary IP address (also see the **--add-host** option).

#### **--infra-command**=*command*

The command that is run to start the infra container. Default: "/pause".

#### **--infra-conmon-pidfile**=*file*

Write the pid of the infra container's **conmon** process to a file. As **conmon** runs in a separate process than Podman, this is necessary when using systemd to manage Podman containers and pods.

#### **--infra-name**=*name*

The name that is used for the pod's infra container.

#### **--label**, **-l**=*key=value*

Add metadata to a pod.

#### **--label-file**=*file*

Read in a line-delimited file of labels.

#### **--memory**, **-m**=*number\[unit]*

Memory limit. A *unit* can be **b** (bytes), **k** (kibibytes), **m** (mebibytes), or **g** (gibibytes).

Allows the memory available to a container to be constrained. If the host
supports swap memory, then the **--memory** memory setting can be larger than physical
RAM. If a limit of 0 is specified (not using **--memory**), the container's memory is
not limited. The actual limit may be rounded up to a multiple of the operating
system's page size (the value is very large, that's millions of trillions).

This option is not supported on cgroups V1 rootless systems.

#### **--memory-swap**=*number\[unit]*

A limit value equal to memory plus swap.
A *unit* can be **b** (bytes), **k** (kibibytes), **m** (mebibytes), or **g** (gibibytes).

Must be used with the **-m** (**--memory**) flag.
The argument value must be larger than that of
**-m** (**--memory**) By default, it is set to double
the value of **--memory**.

Set *number* to **-1** to enable unlimited swap.

This option is not supported on cgroups V1 rootless systems.

#### **--name**, **-n**

Set a custom name for the cloned pod. The default if not specified is of the syntax: **\<ORIGINAL\_NAME>-clone**

#### **--pid**=*pid*

Set the PID mode for the pod. The default is to create a private PID namespace for the pod. Requires the PID namespace to be shared via --share.

```
host: use the host’s PID namespace for the pod
ns: join the specified PID namespace
private: create a new namespace for the pod (default)
```

#### **--restart**=*policy*

Restart policy to follow when containers exit.
Restart policy does not take effect if a container is stopped via the **podman kill** or **podman stop** commands.

Valid *policy* values are:

- `no`                       : Do not restart containers on exit
- `never`                    : Synonym for **no**; do not restart containers on exit
- `on-failure[:max_retries]` : Restart containers when they exit with a non-zero exit code, retrying indefinitely or until the optional *max\_retries* count is hit
- `always`                   : Restart containers when they exit, regardless of status, retrying indefinitely
- `unless-stopped`           : Restart containers when they exit, unless the container was explicitly stopped by the user. After a system reboot, containers with this policy will be restarted by podman-restart.service only if they were not explicitly stopped by the user before the reboot. This differs from **always**, which restarts containers after a system reboot regardless of whether they were user-stopped

Podman provides a systemd unit file, podman-restart.service, which restarts containers after a system reboot.

When running containers in systemd services, use the restart functionality provided by systemd.
In other words, do not use this option in a container unit, instead set the `Restart=` systemd directive in the `[Service]` section.
See **podman-systemd.unit**(5) and **systemd.service**(5).

Default restart policy for all the containers in a pod.

#### **--security-opt**=*option*

Security Options

- **apparmor=unconfined** : Turn off apparmor confinement for the pod

- **apparmor**=*alternate-profile* : Set the apparmor confinement profile for the pod

- **label=user:***USER*: Set the label user for the pod processes

- **label=role:***ROLE*: Set the label role for the pod processes

- **label=type:***TYPE*: Set the label process type for the pod processes

- **label=level:***LEVEL*: Set the label level for the pod processes

- **label=filetype:***TYPE*: Set the label file type for the pod files

- **label=disable**: Turn off label separation for the pod

Note: Labeling can be disabled for all pods/containers by setting label=false in the **containers.conf** (`/etc/containers/containers.conf` or `$HOME/.config/containers/containers.conf`) file.

- **label=nested**: Allows SELinux modifications within the container. Containers are allowed to modify SELinux labels on files and processes, as long as SELinux policy allows. Without **nested**, containers view SELinux as disabled, even when it is enabled on the host. Containers are prevented from setting any labels.

- **mask**=*/path/1:/path/2*: The paths to mask separated by a colon. A masked path cannot be accessed inside the containers within the pod.

- **no-new-privileges**: Disable container processes from gaining additional privileges through the `execve(2)` system call (e.g. via setuid or setgid bits, or via file capabilities). Programs that rely on setuid/setgid bits set on their executable to change user id or group id are no longer able to do so, and any file capabilities added to the executable (e.g. via `setcap`) are not added to the permitted capability set. For more details, see: <https://docs.kernel.org/userspace-api/no_new_privs.html>.

- **seccomp=unconfined**: Turn off seccomp confinement for the pod.

- **seccomp=profile.json**: JSON file to be used as a seccomp filter. Note that the `io.podman.annotations.seccomp` annotation is set with the specified value as shown in `podman inspect`.

- **proc-opts**=*OPTIONS* : Comma-separated list of options to use for the /proc mount. More details
  for the possible mount options are specified in the **proc(5)** man page.

- **unmask**=*ALL* or */path/1:/path/2*, or shell expanded paths (/proc/\*): Paths to unmask separated by a colon. If set to **ALL**, it unmasks all the paths that are masked or made read-only by default.
  The default masked paths are **/proc/acpi, /proc/kcore, /proc/keys, /proc/latency\_stats, /proc/sched\_debug, /proc/scsi, /proc/timer\_list, /proc/timer\_stats, /sys/firmware, and /sys/fs/selinux**, **/sys/devices/virtual/powercap**.  The default paths that are read-only are **/proc/asound**, **/proc/bus**, **/proc/fs**, **/proc/irq**, **/proc/sys**, **/proc/sysrq-trigger**, **/sys/fs/cgroup**.

Note: Labeling can be disabled for all containers by setting **label=false** in the **containers.conf**(5) file.

#### **--shm-size**=*number\[unit]*

Size of */dev/shm*. A *unit* can be **b** (bytes), **k** (kibibytes), **m** (mebibytes), or **g** (gibibytes).
If the unit is omitted, the system uses bytes. If the size is omitted, the default is **64m**.
When *size* is **0**, there is no limit on the amount of memory used for IPC by the pod.
This option conflicts with **--ipc=host**.

#### **--shm-size-systemd**=*number\[unit]*

Size of systemd-specific tmpfs mounts such as /run, /run/lock, /var/log/journal and /tmp.
A *unit* can be **b** (bytes), **k** (kibibytes), **m** (mebibytes), or **g** (gibibytes).
If the unit is omitted, the system uses bytes. If the size is omitted, the default is **64m**.
When *size* is **0**, the usage is limited to 50% of the host's available memory.

#### **--start**

When set to true, this flag starts the newly created pod after the
clone process has completed. All containers within the pod are started.

#### **--subgidname**=*name*

Run the container in a new user namespace using the map with *name* in the */etc/subgid* file.
When running rootless, the user needs the necessary permissions to use the mapping. See **subgid**(5).
This flag conflicts with **--userns** and **--gidmap**.
Together with **--gidmap** it acts as if **--gidmap** was passed with all mappings of the *name* group in */etc/subgid*.

#### **--subuidname**=*name*

Run the container in a new user namespace using the map with *name* in the */etc/subuid* file.
When running rootless, the user needs the necessary permissions to use the mapping. See **subuid**(5).
This flag conflicts with **--userns** and **--uidmap**.
Together with **--uidmap** it acts as if **--uidmap** was passed with all mappings of the *name* user in */etc/subuid*.

#### **--sysctl**=*name=value*

Configure namespaced kernel parameters for all containers in the pod.

For the IPC namespace, the following sysctls are allowed:

- kernel.msgmax
- kernel.msgmnb
- kernel.msgmni
- kernel.sem
- kernel.shmall
- kernel.shmmax
- kernel.shmmni
- kernel.shm\_rmid\_forced
- Sysctls beginning with fs.mqueue.\*

Note: if the ipc namespace is not shared within the pod, the above sysctls are not allowed.

For the network namespace, only sysctls beginning with net.\* are allowed.

Note: if the network namespace is not shared within the pod, the above sysctls are not allowed.

#### **--uidmap**=*container\_uid:from\_uid\[:amount]*

Run all containers in the pod in a new user namespace using the supplied mapping. This
option conflicts with the **--userns** and **--subuidname** options. This
option provides a way to map host UIDs to container UIDs. It can be passed
several times to map different ranges.

#### **--userns**=*mode*

Set the user namespace mode for all the containers in a pod. It defaults to the `PODMAN_USERNS` environment variable. An empty value ("") means user namespaces are disabled.

Rootless user **--userns=Key** mappings:

| Key     | Host User | Container User                                             |
| ------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| ""      | $UID      | 0 (Default User account mapped to root user in container.) |
| host    | $UID      | 0 (Default User account mapped to root user in container.) |
| keep-id | $UID      | $UID (Map user account to same UID within container.)      |
| auto    | $UID      | nil (Host User UID is not mapped into container.)          |
| nomap   | $UID      | nil (Host User UID is not mapped into container.)          |

Valid *mode* values are:

- *auto\[:**OPTIONS,...**]*: automatically create a namespace. It is possible to specify these options to `auto`:

  - *gidmapping=**CONTAINER\_GID:HOST\_GID:SIZE* to force a GID mapping to be present in the user namespace.

  - *size=**SIZE*: to specify an explicit size for the automatic user namespace. e.g. `--userns=auto:size=8192`. If `size` is not specified, `auto` estimates the size for the user namespace.

  - *uidmapping=**CONTAINER\_UID:HOST\_UID:SIZE* to force a UID mapping to be present in the user namespace.

- *host*: run in the user namespace of the caller. The processes running in the container have the same privileges on the host as any other process launched by the calling user (default).

- *keep-id*: creates a user namespace where the current rootless user's UID:GID are mapped to the same values in the container. This option is not allowed for containers created by the root user.

- *nomap*: creates a user namespace where the current rootless user's UID:GID are not mapped into the container. This option is not allowed for containers created by the root user.

#### **--uts**=*mode*

Set the UTS namespace mode for the pod. The following values are supported:

- **host**: use the host's UTS namespace inside the pod.
- **private**: create a new namespace for the pod (default).
- **ns:\[path]**: run the pod in the given existing UTS namespace.

#### **--volume**, **-v**=*\[\[SOURCE-VOLUME|HOST-DIR:]CONTAINER-DIR\[:OPTIONS]]*

Create a bind mount. If `-v /HOST-DIR:/CONTAINER-DIR` is specified, Podman
bind mounts `/HOST-DIR` from the host into `/CONTAINER-DIR` in the Podman
container. Similarly, `-v SOURCE-VOLUME:/CONTAINER-DIR` mounts the named
volume from the host into the container. If no such named volume exists,
Podman creates one. The **nocreate** option can be used to disable this
behavior and require the volume to already exist. If no source is given,
the volume is created as an anonymously named volume with a randomly
generated name, and is removed when the pod is removed via
the `--rm` flag or the `podman rm --volumes` command.

(Note when using the remote client, including Mac and Windows (excluding WSL2) machines, the volumes are mounted from the remote server, not necessarily the client machine.)

The *OPTIONS* is a comma-separated list and can be one or more of:

- **rw**|**ro**
- **z**|**Z**
- \[**O**]
- \[**U**]
- \[**no**]**copy**
- \[**no**]**dev**
- \[**no**]**exec**
- \[**no**]**suid**
- \[**r**]**bind**
- \[**r**]**shared**|\[**r**]**slave**|\[**r**]**private**\[**r**]**unbindable** <sup>\[1]</sup>
- **idmap**\[=**options**]
- **nocreate**

The `CONTAINER-DIR` must be an absolute path such as `/src/docs`. The volume
is mounted into the container at this directory.

If a volume source is specified, it must be a path on the host or the name of a
named volume. Host paths are allowed to be absolute or relative; relative paths
are resolved relative to the directory Podman is run in. If the source does not
exist, Podman returns an error. Users must pre-create the source files or
directories.

Any source that does not begin with a `.` or `/` is treated as the name of
a named volume. If a volume with that name does not exist, it is created.
Volumes created with names are not anonymous, and they are not removed by the `--rm`
option and the `podman rm --volumes` command.

The **nocreate** option can be specified for named volumes to prevent automatic
volume creation. If **nocreate** is set and the volume does not exist, Podman
returns an error instead of creating the volume. This is useful when you want
to ensure that a volume was explicitly created before use.

```
$ podman pod clone -v myvolume:/data:nocreate alpine
```

Specify multiple **-v** options to mount one or more volumes into a
pod.

`Write Protected Volume Mounts`

Add **:ro** or **:rw** option to mount a volume in read-only or
read-write mode, respectively. By default, the volumes are mounted read-write.
See examples.

`Chowning Volume Mounts`

When a named volume is first mounted to a container, Podman
automatically adjusts the ownership of the volume's mount point during
container initialization. This chown operation occurs under the
following conditions:

- The volume was not used yet (has `NeedsChown` set to true)
- The volume is empty or has not been copied up yet
- The volume is not managed by an external volume driver
- The volume driver is not "image"

For volumes with idmapped mounts (using the `idmap` option), the
ownership change takes into account the container's user namespace
mappings, but the idmapped volume retains proper UID/GID mapping. For
volumes without idmapping, the mount point is chowned to match the
container's process user and group, mapped to the host user namespace
if user namespace remapping is enabled.

If a pod is created in a new user namespace, the UID and
GID in the container may correspond to another UID and GID on the host.

The `:U` suffix tells Podman to use the correct host UID and GID based on the
UID and GID within the pod, to change recursively the owner and
group of the source volume. Chowning walks the file system under the volume and
changes the UID/GID on each file. If the volume has thousands of inodes, this
process takes a long time, delaying the start of the pod.

**Warning** use with caution since this modifies the host filesystem.

`Labeling Volume Mounts`

Labeling systems like SELinux require that proper labels are placed on volume
content mounted into a pod. Without a label, the security system
might prevent the processes running inside the pod from using the
content. By default, Podman does not change the labels set by the OS.

To change a label in the pod context, add either of two suffixes
**:z** or **:Z** to the volume mount. These suffixes tell Podman to relabel file
objects on the shared volumes. The **z** option tells Podman that two or more
pods share the volume content. As a result, Podman labels the
content with a shared content label. Shared volume labels allow all containers
to read/write content. The **Z** option tells Podman to label the content with
a private unshared label. Only the current pod can use a private
volume.

Note: all containers within a `pod` share the same SELinux label. This
means all containers within said pod can read/write volumes shared into the
container created with the `:Z` on any one of the containers. Relabeling walks
the file system under the volume and changes the label on each file; if the
volume has thousands of inodes, this process takes a long time, delaying the
start of the pod. If the volume was previously relabeled with the
`z` option, Podman is optimized to not relabel a second time. If files are
moved into the volume, then the labels can be manually changed with the
`chcon -Rt container_file_t PATH` command.

Note: Do not relabel system files and directories. Relabeling system content
might cause other confined services on the machine to fail.  For these types
of containers we recommend disabling SELinux separation.  The option
**--security-opt label=disable** disables SELinux separation for the pod.
For example if a user wanted to volume mount their entire home directory into a
pod, they need to disable SELinux separation.

```
$ podman pod clone --security-opt label=disable -v $HOME:/home/user fedora touch /home/user/file
```

`Overlay Volume Mounts`

The `:O` flag tells Podman to mount the directory from the host as a
temporary storage using the `overlay file system`. The pod processes
can modify content within the mountpoint which is stored in the
container storage in a separate directory. In overlay terms, the source
directory is the lower, and the container storage directory is the
upper. Modifications to the mount point are destroyed when the pod
finishes executing, similar to a tmpfs mount point being unmounted.

For advanced users, the **overlay** option also supports custom non-volatile
**upperdir** and **workdir** for the overlay mount. Custom **upperdir** and
**workdir** can be fully managed by the users themselves, and Podman does not
remove it on lifecycle completion.
Example **:O,upperdir=/some/upper,workdir=/some/work**

Subsequent executions of the container sees the original source directory
content, any changes from previous pod executions no longer exist.

One use case of the overlay mount is sharing the package cache from the
host into the container to allow speeding up builds.

Note: The `O` flag conflicts with other options listed above.

Content mounted into the container is labeled with the private label.
On SELinux systems, labels in the source directory must be readable
by the pod infra container label. Usually containers can read/execute `container_share_t`
and can read/write `container_file_t`. If unable to change the labels on a
source volume, SELinux container separation must be disabled for the pod or infra container
to work.

Do not modify the source directory mounted into the pod with an overlay mount,
it can cause unexpected failures. Only modify the directory after the container finishes running.

`Mounts propagation`

By default, bind-mounted volumes are `private`. That means any mounts done
inside the pod are not visible on the host and vice versa.
One can change this behavior by specifying a volume mount propagation property.
When a volume is `shared`, mounts done under that volume inside the pod
are visible on host and vice versa. Making a volume **slave**<sup>\[1]</sup>
enables only one-way mount propagation: mounts done on the host under that volume
are visible inside the container but not the other way around.

To control mount propagation property of a volume one can use the \[**r**]**shared**,
\[**r**]**slave**, \[**r**]**private** or the \[**r**]**unbindable** propagation flag.
Propagation property can be specified only for bind mounted volumes and not for
internal volumes or named volumes. For mount propagation to work the source mount
point (the mount point where source dir is mounted on) has to have the right propagation
properties. For shared volumes, the source mount point has to be shared. And for
slave volumes, the source mount point has to be either shared or slave. <sup>\[1]</sup>

To recursively mount a volume and all of its submounts into a
pod, use the **rbind** option. By default the bind option is
used, and submounts of the source directory is not mounted into the
pod.

Mounting the volume with a **copy** option tells podman to copy content from
the underlying destination directory onto newly created internal volumes. The
**copy** only happens on the initial creation of the volume. Content is not
copied up when the volume is subsequently used on different containers. The
**copy** option is ignored on bind mounts and has no effect.

Mounting volumes with the **nosuid** options means that SUID executables on the
volume can not be used by applications to change their privilege. By default
volumes are mounted with **nosuid**.

Mounting the volume with the **noexec** option means that no executables on the
volume can be executed within the pod.

Mounting the volume with the **nodev** option means that no devices on the volume
can be used by processes within the pod. By default volumes
are mounted with **nodev**.

If the *HOST-DIR* is a mount point, then **dev**, **suid**, and **exec** options are
ignored by the kernel.

Use **df HOST-DIR** to figure out the source mount, then use
**findmnt -o TARGET,PROPAGATION *source-mount-dir*** to figure out propagation
properties of source mount. If **findmnt**(1) utility is not available, then one
can look at the mount entry for the source mount point in */proc/self/mountinfo*. Look
at the "optional fields" and see if any propagation properties are specified.
In there, **shared:N** means the mount is shared, **master:N** means mount
is slave, and if nothing is there, the mount is private. <sup>\[1]</sup>

To change propagation properties of a mount point, use **mount**(8) command. For
example, if one wants to bind mount source directory */foo*, one can do
**mount --bind /foo /foo** and **mount --make-private --make-shared /foo**. This
converts /foo into a shared mount point. Alternatively, one can directly
change propagation properties of source mount. Say */* is source mount for
*/foo*, then use **mount --make-shared /** to convert */* into a shared mount.

Note: if the user only has access rights via a group, accessing the volume
from inside a rootless pod fails.

`Idmapped mount`

If `idmap` is specified, create an idmapped mount to the target user
namespace in the container. The idmap option supports a custom mapping
that can be different than the user namespace used by the
container. The mapping can be specified after the idmap option like:
`idmap=uids=0-1-10#10-11-10;gids=0-100-10`.
For each triplet, the first value is the start of the backing file
system IDs that are mapped to the second value on the host.  The
length of this mapping is given in the third value.
Multiple ranges are separated with #.

#### **--volumes-from**=*CONTAINER\[:OPTIONS]*

Mount volumes from the specified container(s). Used to share volumes between
containers and pods. The *options* is a comma-separated list with the following available elements:

- **rw**|**ro**
- **z**

Mounts already mounted volumes from a source container onto another
pod. *CONTAINER* may be a name or ID.
To share a volume, use the --volumes-from option when running
the target container. Volumes can be shared even if the source container
is not running.

By default, Podman mounts the volumes in the same mode (read-write or
read-only) as it is mounted in the source container.
This can be changed by adding a `ro` or `rw` *option*.

Labeling systems like SELinux require that proper labels are placed on volume
content mounted into a pod. Without a label, the security system might
prevent the processes running inside the container from using the content. By
default, Podman does not change the labels set by the OS.

To change a label in the pod context, add `z` to the volume mount.
This suffix tells Podman to relabel file objects on the shared volumes. The `z`
option tells Podman that two entities share the volume content. As a result,
Podman labels the content with a shared content label. Shared volume labels allow
all containers to read/write content.

If the location of the volume from the source container overlaps with
data residing on a target pod, then the volume hides
that data on the target.

## FOOTNOTES

<a name="Footnote1">1</a>: The Podman project is committed to inclusivity, a core value of open source. The `master` and `slave` mount propagation terminology used here is problematic and divisive, and needs to be changed. However, these terms are currently used within the Linux kernel and must be used as-is at this time. When the kernel maintainers rectify this usage, Podman will follow suit immediately.
