# podman-build.unit

# NAME

podman-build.unit - systemd unit files for building container images using Podman Quadlet

# SYNOPSIS

*name*.build

# DESCRIPTION

Build files are named with a `.build` extension and contain a section `[Build]` describing the image
build command. The generated service is a one-shot service that ensures that the image is built on
the host from a supplied Containerfile and context directory. Subsequent (re-)starts of the
generated build service will usually finish quickly, as image layer caching will skip unchanged
build steps.

A minimal `.build` unit needs at least `ImageTag=` and either `File=` or `SetWorkingDirectory=`.

Using build units allows containers and volumes to depend on images being built locally. This can be
interesting for creating container images not available on container registries, or for local
testing and development.

# USAGE SUMMARY

The `.build` file is parsed by the `podman-system-generator` at boot or reload, generating a systemd
`.service` that runs `podman build`. That service can be managed like any other unit:

```bash
systemctl --user start myimage-build.service
```

The resulting image can be referenced by `.container` or `.volume` units via:

```ini
Image=myimage.build
```

### `Annotation=annotation=value [annotation=value ...]`

Add an image *annotation* (e.g. annotation=*value*) to the image metadata. Can
be used multiple times.

Note: this information is not present in Docker image formats, so it is
discarded when writing images in Docker formats.

### `Arch=ARCH`

Override the architecture, defaults to the host, of the image to be pulled. For example, `arm`.
Unless overridden, subsequent lookups of the same image in the local storage matches this architecture, regardless of the host.

### `AuthFile=path`

Path of the authentication file. Default is `${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/containers/auth.json` on Linux, and `$HOME/.config/containers/auth.json` on Windows/macOS.
The file is created by **[podman login](https://github.com/podman-container-tools/podman/blob/cade97a52ebdf9dbf9e81de8009015776837a074/docs/source/markdown/podman-login.1.md.in)**. If the authorization state is not found there, `$HOME/.docker/config.json` is checked, which is set using **docker login**.

Note: There is also the option to override the default path of the authentication file by setting the `REGISTRY_AUTH_FILE` environment variable. This can be done with **export REGISTRY\_AUTH\_FILE=*path***.

### `ContainersConfModule=module`

Load the specified containers.conf(5) module.

This option can be listed multiple times.

### `DNS=ipaddr`

Set custom DNS servers.

This option can be used to override the DNS
configuration passed to the container. Typically this is necessary when the
host DNS configuration is invalid for the container (e.g., **127.0.0.1**). When this
is the case, the **DNS=.** flag is necessary for every run.

The special value **none** can be specified to disable creation of */etc/resolv.conf* in the container by Podman.
The */etc/resolv.conf* file in the image is then used without changes.

Note that **ipaddr** may be added directly to the container's */etc/resolv.conf*.
This is not guaranteed though.  For example, passing a custom network whose *dns\_enabled* is set to *true* to **--network** will result in */etc/resolv.conf* only referring to the aardvark-dns server.  aardvark-dns then forwards to the supplied **ipaddr** for all non-container name queries.

### `DNSOption=option`

Set custom DNS options to be used during the build.

### `DNSSearch=domain`

Set custom DNS search domains to be used during the build.

### `Environment=env=value [env=value ...]`

Set environment variables.

This option allows arbitrary environment variables that are available for the process to be launched inside of the container. If an environment variable is specified without a value, Podman checks the host environment for a value and set the variable only if it is set on the host. As a special case, if an environment variable ending in **\*** is specified without a value, Podman searches the host environment for variables starting with the prefix and adds those variables to the container.

### `File=Containerfile`

Specifies a Containerfile which contains instructions for building the image,
either a local file or an **http** or **https** URL.  If more than one
Containerfile is specified, *FROM* instructions are only accepted from the
last specified file.

Note that for a given relative path to a Containerfile, or when using a `http(s)://` URL, also set
`SetWorkingDirectory=` in order for `podman build` to find a valid context directory for the
resources specified in the Containerfile.

Note that setting a `File=` field is mandatory for a `.build` file, unless `SetWorkingDirectory` (or
a `WorkingDirectory` in the `Service` group) has also been set.

Specifying the option File=- causes
the Containerfile contents to be read from stdin.

### `ForceRM=`

Always remove intermediate containers after a build, even if the build fails (default true).

### `GlobalArgs=`

This key contains a list of arguments passed directly after the `podman` command in the generated
file. It can be used to access Podman features otherwise unsupported by the generator. Since the
generator is unaware of what unexpected interactions can be caused by these arguments, it is not
recommended to use this option.

The format of this is a space separated list of arguments, which can optionally be individually
escaped to allow inclusion of whitespace and other control characters.

This key can be listed multiple times.

### `GroupAdd=group | keep-groups`

Assign additional groups to the primary user running within the container process.

- `keep-groups` is a special flag that tells Podman to keep the supplementary group access.

Allows container to use the user's supplementary group access. If file systems or
devices are only accessible by the rootless user's group, this flag tells the OCI
runtime to pass the group access into the container. Currently only available
with the `crun` OCI runtime. Note: `keep-groups` is exclusive, other groups cannot be specified
with this flag. (Not available for remote commands, including Mac and Windows (excluding WSL2) machines)

### `ImageTag=imageName`

Specifies the name which is assigned to the resulting image if the build process completes successfully.
If *imageName* does not include a registry name, the registry name *localhost* is prepended to the image name.

### `Label=label`

Add an image *label* (e.g. label=*value*) to the image metadata. Can be used
multiple times.

Users can set a special LABEL **io.containers.capabilities=CAP1,CAP2,CAP3** in
a Containerfile that specifies the list of Linux capabilities required for the
container to run properly. This label specified in a container image tells
Podman to run the container with just these capabilities. Podman launches the
container with just the specified capabilities, as long as this list of
capabilities is a subset of the default list.

If the specified capabilities are not in the default set, Podman prints an error
message and runs the container with the default capabilities.

### `Network=mode`

Sets the configuration for network namespaces when handling `RUN` instructions.

Special case:

- If the `name` of the network ends with `.network`, Quadlet will look for the corresponding `.network` Quadlet unit. If found, Quadlet will use the name of the Network set in the Unit, otherwise, `systemd-$name` is used. The generated systemd service contains a dependency on the service unit generated for that `.network` unit, or on `$name-network.service` if the `.network` unit is not found. Note: the corresponding `.network` file must exist.

Valid *mode* values are:

- **none**: no networking.
- **host**: use the Podman host network stack. Note: the host mode gives the
  container full access to local system services such as D-bus and is therefore
  considered insecure.
- **ns:***path*: path to a network namespace to join.
- **private**: create a new namespace for the container (default)
- **\<network name|ID>**: Join the network with the given name or ID, e.g. use `--network mynet` to join the network with the name mynet. Only supported for rootful users.
- **pasta\[:OPTIONS,...]**: use **pasta**(1) to create a user-mode networking
  stack. \
  This is the default for rootless containers and only supported in rootless mode. \
  By default, IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and routes, as well as the pod interface
  name, are copied from the host. If port forwarding isn't configured, ports
  are forwarded dynamically as services are bound on either side (init
  namespace or container namespace). Port forwarding preserves the original
  source IP address. Options described in pasta(1) can be specified as
  comma-separated arguments. \
  In terms of pasta(1) options, **--config-net** is given by default, in
  order to configure networking when the container is started, and
  **--no-map-gw** is also assumed by default, to avoid direct access from
  container to host using the gateway address. The latter can be overridden
  by passing **--map-gw** in the pasta-specific options (despite not being an
  actual pasta(1) option). \
  Also, **-t none** and **-u none** are passed to disable
  automatic port forwarding based on bound ports. Similarly, **-T none** and
  **-U none** are given to disable the same functionality from container to
  host. \
  Some examples:
  - **pasta:--map-gw**: Allow the container to directly reach the host using the
    gateway address.
  - **pasta:--mtu,1500**: Specify a 1500 bytes MTU for the *tap* interface in
    the container.
  - **pasta:--ipv4-only,-a,10.0.2.0,-n,24,-g,10.0.2.2,--dns-forward,10.0.2.3,-m,1500,--no-ndp,--no-dhcpv6,--no-dhcp**:
    disable IPv6, assign `10.0.2.0/24` to the `tap0` interface in the container,
    with gateway `10.0.2.3`, enable DNS forwarder reachable at `10.0.2.3`,
    set MTU to 1500 bytes, disable NDP, DHCPv6 and DHCP support.
  - **pasta:-I,tap0,--ipv4-only,-a,10.0.2.0,-n,24,-g,10.0.2.2,--dns-forward,10.0.2.3,--no-ndp,--no-dhcpv6,--no-dhcp**:
    same as above, but leave the MTU to 65520 bytes
  - **pasta:-t,auto,-u,auto,-T,auto,-U,auto**: enable automatic port forwarding
    based on observed bound ports from both host and container sides
  - **pasta:-T,5201**: enable forwarding of TCP port 5201 from container to
    host, using the loopback interface instead of the tap interface for improved
    performance

### `PodmanArgs=`

This key contains a list of arguments passed directly to the end of the `podman` command
in the generated file. It can be used to access Podman features otherwise unsupported
by the generator. Since the generator is unaware of what unexpected interactions can be
caused by these arguments, it is not recommended to use this option.

The format of this is a space separated list of arguments, which can optionally be individually
escaped to allow inclusion of whitespace and other control characters.

This key can be listed multiple times.

### `Pull=policy`

Pull image policy. The default is **missing**.

- **always**: Always pull the image and throw an error if the pull fails.
- **missing**: Pull the image only when the image is not in the local containers storage.  Throw an error if no image is found and the pull fails.
- **never**: Never pull the image but use the one from the local containers storage.  Throw an error if no image is found.
- **newer**: Pull if the image on the registry is newer than the one in the local containers storage.  An image is considered to be newer when the digests are different.  Comparing the time stamps is prone to errors.  Pull errors are suppressed if a local image was found.

### `Retry=attempts`

Number of times to retry pulling or pushing images between the registry and
local storage in case of failure. Default is **3**.

### `RetryDelay=duration`

Duration of delay between retry attempts when pulling or pushing images between
the registry and local storage in case of failure. The default is to start at two seconds and then exponentially back off. The delay is used when this value is set, and no exponential back off occurs.

### `Secret=id=id[,src=envOrFile][,env=ENV][,type=file | env]`

Pass secret information to be used in the Containerfile for building images
in a safe way that will not end up stored in the final image, or be seen in other stages.
The value of the secret will be read from an environment variable or file named
by the "id" option, or named by the "src" option if it is specified, or from an
environment variable specified by the "env" option. See [EXAMPLES](#examples).
The secret will be mounted in the container at `/run/secrets/id` by default.

To later use the secret, use the --mount flag in a `RUN` instruction within a `Containerfile`:

`RUN --mount=type=secret,id=mysecret cat /run/secrets/mysecret`

The location of the secret in the container can be overridden using the
"target", "dst", or "destination" option of the `RUN --mount` flag.

`RUN --mount=type=secret,id=mysecret,target=/run/secrets/myothersecret cat /run/secrets/myothersecret`

Note: changing the contents of secret files will not trigger a rebuild of layers that use said secrets.

### `SetWorkingDirectory=path`

Provide context (a working directory) to `podman build`. Supported values are a path, a URL, or the
special keys `file` or `unit` to set the context directory to the parent directory of the file from
the `File=` key or to that of the Quadlet `.build` unit file, respectively. This allows Quadlet to
resolve relative paths.

When using one of the special keys (`file` or `unit`), the `WorkingDirectory` field of the `Service`
group of the Systemd service unit will also be set accordingly. Alternatively, users can
explicitly set the `WorkingDirectory` field of the `Service` group in the `.build` file. Please note
that if the `WorkingDirectory` field of the `Service` group is set by the user, Quadlet will not
overwrite it even if `SetWorkingDirectory` is set to `file` or `unit`.

By providing a URL to `SetWorkingDirectory=` you can instruct `podman build` to clone a Git
repository or download an archive file extracted to a temporary location by `podman build` as build
context. Note that in this case, the `WorkingDirectory` of the Systemd service unit is left
untouched by Quadlet.

Note that providing a context directory is mandatory for a `.build` file, unless a `File=` key has
also been provided.

### `Target=stageName`

Set the target build stage to build.  When building a Containerfile with multiple build stages, --target can be used to specify an intermediate build stage by name as the final stage for the resulting image. Commands after the target stage is skipped.

### `TLSVerify=`

Require HTTPS and verify certificates when contacting registries (default: **true**).
If explicitly set to **true**, TLS verification is used.
If set to **false**, TLS verification is not used.
If not specified, TLS verification is used unless the target registry
is listed as an insecure registry in **[containers-registries.conf(5)](https://github.com/containers/image/blob/main/docs/containers-registries.conf.5.md)**

### `Variant=VARIANT`

Set the architecture variant of the image to be built, and that of the base
image to be pulled, if the build uses one, to the provided value instead of
using the architecture variant of the build host.

### `Volume=[[SOURCE-VOLUME|HOST-DIR:]CONTAINER-DIR[:OPTIONS]]`

Create a bind mount. If `-v /HOST-DIR:/CONTAINER-DIR` is specified, Podman
bind mounts `/HOST-DIR` from the host into `/CONTAINER-DIR` in the Podman
container. Similarly, `-v SOURCE-VOLUME:/CONTAINER-DIR` mounts the named
volume from the host into the container. If no such named volume exists,
Podman creates one. The **nocreate** option can be used to disable this
behavior and require the volume to already exist. If no source is given,
the volume is created as an anonymously named volume with a randomly
generated name, and is removed when the container is removed via
the `--rm` flag or the `podman rm --volumes` command.

Special case:

- If `SOURCE-VOLUME` ends with `.volume`, a Podman named volume called `systemd-$name` is used as the source, and the generated systemd service contains a dependency on the `$name-volume.service`. Note that the corresponding `.volume` file must exist.

(Note when using the remote client, including Mac and Windows (excluding WSL2) machines, the volumes are mounted from the remote server, not necessarily the client machine.)

The *OPTIONS* is a comma-separated list and can be one or more of:

- **rw**|**ro**
- **z**|**Z**
- \[**O**]
- \[**U**]
- \[**no**]**copy**
- \[**no**]**dev**
- \[**no**]**exec**
- \[**no**]**suid**
- \[**r**]**bind**
- \[**r**]**shared**|\[**r**]**slave**|\[**r**]**private**\[**r**]**unbindable** <sup>\[1]</sup>
- **idmap**\[=**options**]
- **nocreate**

The `CONTAINER-DIR` must be an absolute path such as `/src/docs`. The volume
is mounted into the container at this directory.

If a volume source is specified, it must be a path on the host or the name of a
named volume. Host paths are allowed to be absolute or relative; relative paths
are resolved relative to the directory Podman is run in. If the source does not
exist, Podman returns an error. Users must pre-create the source files or
directories.

Any source that does not begin with a `.` or `/` is treated as the name of
a named volume. If a volume with that name does not exist, it is created.
Volumes created with names are not anonymous, and they are not removed by the `--rm`
option and the `podman rm --volumes` command.

The **nocreate** option can be specified for named volumes to prevent automatic
volume creation. If **nocreate** is set and the volume does not exist, Podman
returns an error instead of creating the volume. This is useful when you want
to ensure that a volume was explicitly created before use.

```
$ podman podman-build.unit.5.md.in -v myvolume:/data:nocreate alpine
```

Specify multiple **-v** options to mount one or more volumes into a
container.

`Write Protected Volume Mounts`

Add **:ro** or **:rw** option to mount a volume in read-only or
read-write mode, respectively. By default, the volumes are mounted read-write.
See examples.

`Chowning Volume Mounts`

When a named volume is first mounted to a container, Podman
automatically adjusts the ownership of the volume's mount point during
container initialization. This chown operation occurs under the
following conditions:

- The volume was not used yet (has `NeedsChown` set to true)
- The volume is empty or has not been copied up yet
- The volume is not managed by an external volume driver
- The volume driver is not "image"

For volumes with idmapped mounts (using the `idmap` option), the
ownership change takes into account the container's user namespace
mappings, but the idmapped volume retains proper UID/GID mapping. For
volumes without idmapping, the mount point is chowned to match the
container's process user and group, mapped to the host user namespace
if user namespace remapping is enabled.

If a container is created in a new user namespace, the UID and
GID in the container may correspond to another UID and GID on the host.

The `:U` suffix tells Podman to use the correct host UID and GID based on the
UID and GID within the container, to change recursively the owner and
group of the source volume. Chowning walks the file system under the volume and
changes the UID/GID on each file. If the volume has thousands of inodes, this
process takes a long time, delaying the start of the container.

**Warning** use with caution since this modifies the host filesystem.

`Labeling Volume Mounts`

Labeling systems like SELinux require that proper labels are placed on volume
content mounted into a container. Without a label, the security system
might prevent the processes running inside the container from using the
content. By default, Podman does not change the labels set by the OS.

To change a label in the container context, add either of two suffixes
**:z** or **:Z** to the volume mount. These suffixes tell Podman to relabel file
objects on the shared volumes. The **z** option tells Podman that two or more
containers share the volume content. As a result, Podman labels the
content with a shared content label. Shared volume labels allow all containers
to read/write content. The **Z** option tells Podman to label the content with
a private unshared label. Only the current container can use a private
volume.

Note: all containers within a `pod` share the same SELinux label. This
means all containers within said pod can read/write volumes shared into the
container created with the `:Z` on any one of the containers. Relabeling walks
the file system under the volume and changes the label on each file; if the
volume has thousands of inodes, this process takes a long time, delaying the
start of the container. If the volume was previously relabeled with the
`z` option, Podman is optimized to not relabel a second time. If files are
moved into the volume, then the labels can be manually changed with the
`chcon -Rt container_file_t PATH` command.

Note: Do not relabel system files and directories. Relabeling system content
might cause other confined services on the machine to fail.  For these types
of containers we recommend disabling SELinux separation.  The option
**--security-opt label=disable** disables SELinux separation for the container.
For example if a user wanted to volume mount their entire home directory into a
container, they need to disable SELinux separation.

```
$ podman podman-build.unit.5.md.in --security-opt label=disable -v $HOME:/home/user fedora touch /home/user/file
```

`Overlay Volume Mounts`

The `:O` flag tells Podman to mount the directory from the host as a
temporary storage using the `overlay file system`. The container processes
can modify content within the mountpoint which is stored in the
container storage in a separate directory. In overlay terms, the source
directory is the lower, and the container storage directory is the
upper. Modifications to the mount point are destroyed when the container
finishes executing, similar to a tmpfs mount point being unmounted.

For advanced users, the **overlay** option also supports custom non-volatile
**upperdir** and **workdir** for the overlay mount. Custom **upperdir** and
**workdir** can be fully managed by the users themselves, and Podman does not
remove it on lifecycle completion.
Example **:O,upperdir=/some/upper,workdir=/some/work**

Subsequent executions of the container sees the original source directory
content, any changes from previous container executions no longer exist.

One use case of the overlay mount is sharing the package cache from the
host into the container to allow speeding up builds.

Note: The `O` flag conflicts with other options listed above.

Content mounted into the container is labeled with the private label.
On SELinux systems, labels in the source directory must be readable
by the  container label. Usually containers can read/execute `container_share_t`
and can read/write `container_file_t`. If unable to change the labels on a
source volume, SELinux container separation must be disabled for the  container
to work.

Do not modify the source directory mounted into the container with an overlay mount,
it can cause unexpected failures. Only modify the directory after the container finishes running.

`Mounts propagation`

By default, bind-mounted volumes are `private`. That means any mounts done
inside the container are not visible on the host and vice versa.
One can change this behavior by specifying a volume mount propagation property.
When a volume is `shared`, mounts done under that volume inside the container
are visible on host and vice versa. Making a volume **slave**<sup>\[1]</sup>
enables only one-way mount propagation: mounts done on the host under that volume
are visible inside the container but not the other way around.

To control mount propagation property of a volume one can use the \[**r**]**shared**,
\[**r**]**slave**, \[**r**]**private** or the \[**r**]**unbindable** propagation flag.
Propagation property can be specified only for bind mounted volumes and not for
internal volumes or named volumes. For mount propagation to work the source mount
point (the mount point where source dir is mounted on) has to have the right propagation
properties. For shared volumes, the source mount point has to be shared. And for
slave volumes, the source mount point has to be either shared or slave. <sup>\[1]</sup>

To recursively mount a volume and all of its submounts into a
container, use the **rbind** option. By default the bind option is
used, and submounts of the source directory is not mounted into the
container.

Mounting the volume with a **copy** option tells podman to copy content from
the underlying destination directory onto newly created internal volumes. The
**copy** only happens on the initial creation of the volume. Content is not
copied up when the volume is subsequently used on different containers. The
**copy** option is ignored on bind mounts and has no effect.

Mounting volumes with the **nosuid** options means that SUID executables on the
volume can not be used by applications to change their privilege. By default
volumes are mounted with **nosuid**.

Mounting the volume with the **noexec** option means that no executables on the
volume can be executed within the container.

Mounting the volume with the **nodev** option means that no devices on the volume
can be used by processes within the container. By default volumes
are mounted with **nodev**.

If the *HOST-DIR* is a mount point, then **dev**, **suid**, and **exec** options are
ignored by the kernel.

Use **df HOST-DIR** to figure out the source mount, then use
**findmnt -o TARGET,PROPAGATION *source-mount-dir*** to figure out propagation
properties of source mount. If **findmnt**(1) utility is not available, then one
can look at the mount entry for the source mount point in */proc/self/mountinfo*. Look
at the "optional fields" and see if any propagation properties are specified.
In there, **shared:N** means the mount is shared, **master:N** means mount
is slave, and if nothing is there, the mount is private. <sup>\[1]</sup>

To change propagation properties of a mount point, use **mount**(8) command. For
example, if one wants to bind mount source directory */foo*, one can do
**mount --bind /foo /foo** and **mount --make-private --make-shared /foo**. This
converts /foo into a shared mount point. Alternatively, one can directly
change propagation properties of source mount. Say */* is source mount for
*/foo*, then use **mount --make-shared /** to convert */* into a shared mount.

Note: if the user only has access rights via a group, accessing the volume
from inside a rootless container fails.

`Idmapped mount`

If `idmap` is specified, create an idmapped mount to the target user
namespace in the container. The idmap option supports a custom mapping
that can be different than the user namespace used by the
container. The mapping can be specified after the idmap option like:
`idmap=uids=0-1-10#10-11-10;gids=0-100-10`.
For each triplet, the first value is the start of the backing file
system IDs that are mapped to the second value on the host.  The
length of this mapping is given in the third value.
Multiple ranges are separated with #.
