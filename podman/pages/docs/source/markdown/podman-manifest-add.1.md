# podman-manifest-add

## NAME

podman-manifest-add - Add an image or artifact to a manifest list or image index

## SYNOPSIS

**podman manifest add** \[*options*] *listnameorindexname* \[*transport*]:*imagename* *imageorartifactname* \[...]

## DESCRIPTION

Adds the specified image to the specified manifest list or image index, or
creates an artifact manifest and adds it to the specified image index.

## RETURN VALUE

The list image's ID.

## OPTIONS

#### **--all**

If the image which is added to the list or index is itself a list or
index, add all of the contents to the local list.  By default, only one image
from such a list or index is added to the list or index.  Combining
*--all* with any of the other options described below is NOT recommended.

#### **--annotation**=*annotation=value*

Set an annotation on the entry for the specified image or artifact.

#### **--arch**=*architecture*

Override the architecture which the list or index records as a requirement for
the image.  If *imageName* refers to a manifest list or image index, the
architecture information is retrieved from it.  Otherwise, it is
retrieved from the image's configuration information.

#### **--artifact**

Create an artifact manifest and add it to the image index.  Arguments after the
index name will be interpreted as file names rather than as image references.
In most scenarios, the **--artifact-type** option should also be specified.

#### **--artifact-config**=*path*

When creating an artifact manifest and adding it to the image index, use the
specified file's contents as the configuration blob in the artifact manifest.
In most scenarios, leaving the default value, which signifies an empty
configuration, unchanged, is the preferred option.

#### **--artifact-config-type**=*type*

When creating an artifact manifest and adding it to the image index, use the
specified MIME type as the `mediaType` associated with the configuration blob
in the artifact manifest.  In most scenarios, leaving the default value, which
signifies either an empty configuration or the standard OCI configuration type,
unchanged, is the preferred option.

#### **--artifact-exclude-titles**

When creating an artifact manifest and adding it to the image index, do not
set "org.opencontainers.image.title" annotations equal to the file's basename
for each file added to the artifact manifest.  Tools which retrieve artifacts
from a registry may use these values to choose names for files when saving
artifacts to disk, so this option is not recommended unless it is required
for interoperability with a particular registry.

#### **--artifact-layer-type**=*type*

When creating an artifact manifest and adding it to the image index, use the
specified MIME type as the `mediaType` associated with the files' contents.  If
not specified, guesses based on either the files names or their contents will
be made and used, but the option should be specified if certainty is needed.

#### **--artifact-subject**=*imageName*

When creating an artifact manifest and adding it to the image index, set the
*subject* field in the artifact manifest to mark the artifact manifest as being
associated with the specified image in some way.  An artifact manifest can only
be associated with, at most, one subject.

#### **--artifact-type**=*type*

When creating an artifact manifest, use the specified MIME type as the
manifest's `artifactType` value instead of the less informative default value.

#### **--authfile**=*path*

Path of the authentication file. Default is `${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/containers/auth.json` on Linux, and `$HOME/.config/containers/auth.json` on Windows/macOS.
The file is created by **[podman login](https://github.com/podman-container-tools/podman/blob/cade97a52ebdf9dbf9e81de8009015776837a074/docs/source/markdown/podman-login.1.md.in)**. If the authorization state is not found there, `$HOME/.docker/config.json` is checked, which is set using **docker login**.

Note: There is also the option to override the default path of the authentication file by setting the `REGISTRY_AUTH_FILE` environment variable. This can be done with **export REGISTRY\_AUTH\_FILE=*path***.

#### **--cert-dir**=*path*

Use certificates at *path* (\*.crt, \*.cert, \*.key) to connect to the registry. (Default: /etc/containers/certs.d)
For details, see **[containers-certs.d(5)](https://github.com/containers/image/blob/main/docs/containers-certs.d.5.md)**.
(This option is not available with the remote Podman client, including Mac and Windows (excluding WSL2) machines)

#### **--creds**=*\[username\[:password]]*

The \[username\[:password]] to use to authenticate with the registry, if required.
If one or both values are not supplied, a command line prompt appears and the
value can be entered. The password is entered without echo.

Note that the specified credentials are only used to authenticate against
target registries.  They are not used for mirrors or when the registry gets
rewritten (see `containers-registries.conf(5)`); to authenticate against those
consider using a `containers-auth.json(5)` file.

#### **--features**=*feature*

Specify the features list which the list or index records as requirements for
the image.  This option is rarely used.

#### **--os**=*OS*

Override the OS which the list or index records as a requirement for the image.
If *imagename* refers to a manifest list or image index, the OS information
is retrieved from it.  Otherwise, it is retrieved from the image's
configuration information.

#### **--os-version**=*version*

Specify the OS version which the list or index records as a requirement for the
image.  This option is rarely used.

#### **--tls-verify**

Require HTTPS and verify certificates when contacting registries (default: **true**).
If explicitly set to **true**, TLS verification is used.
If set to **false**, TLS verification is not used.
If not specified, TLS verification is used unless the target registry
is listed as an insecure registry in **[containers-registries.conf(5)](https://github.com/containers/image/blob/main/docs/containers-registries.conf.5.md)**

#### **--variant**

Specify the variant which the list or index records for the image.  This option
is typically used to distinguish between multiple entries which share the same
architecture value, but which expect different versions of its instruction set.

## Transport

Multiple transports are supported:

**docker://***docker-reference* *(default)*
An image in a registry implementing the "Docker Registry HTTP API V2". By default, uses the authorization state in `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/containers/auth.json`, which is set using `(podman login)`. If the authorization state is not found there, `$HOME/.docker/config.json` is checked, which is set using `(docker login)`.

```
$ podman manifest add mylist:v1.11 docker://quay.io/username/myimage
```

**containers-storage:***oci-reference*
An image in *oci-reference* format stored in the local container storage. *oci-reference* must contain a tag.

```
$ podman manifest add mylist:v1.11 containers-storage:quay.io/username/myimage
```

**dir:***path*
An existing local directory *path* storing the manifest, layer tarballs, and signatures as individual files. This
is a non-standardized format, primarily useful for debugging or noninvasive container inspection.

```
$ podman manifest add dir:/tmp/myimage
```

**docker-archive:***path*\[**:***docker-reference*]
An image is stored in the `docker save` formatted file.  *docker-reference* is only used when creating such a
file, and it must not contain a digest.

```
$ podman manifest add docker-archive:/tmp/myimage
```

**docker-daemon:***docker-reference*
An image in *docker-reference* format stored in the docker daemon internal storage. The *docker-reference* can also be an image ID (docker-daemon:algo:digest).

```
$ sudo podman manifest add docker-daemon:docker.io/library/myimage:33
```

**oci-archive:***path***:***tag*
An image *tag* in a directory compliant with "Open Container Image Layout Specification" at *path*.

```
$ podman manifest add oci-archive:/tmp/myimage
```

## EXAMPLES

Add specified default image from source manifest list to destination manifest list:

```
podman manifest add mylist:v1.11 docker://fedora
71c201d10fffdcac52968a000d85a0a016ca1c7d5473948000d3131c1773d965
```

Add all images from source manifest list to destination manifest list:

```
podman manifest add --all mylist:v1.11 docker://fedora
71c201d10fffdcac52968a000d85a0a016ca1c7d5473948000d3131c1773d965
```

Add selected image matching arch and variant from source manifest list to destination manifest list:

```
podman manifest add --arch arm64 --variant v8 mylist:v1.11 docker://71c201d10fffdcac52968a000d85a0a016ca1c7d5473948000d3131c1773d965
```
