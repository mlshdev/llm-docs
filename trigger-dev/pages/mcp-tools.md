- `"Show me the LLM cost over time from the AI dashboard"`

## Dev Server Tools

### start\_dev\_server

Start the Trigger.dev dev server (`trigger dev`) in the background. Waits up to 30 seconds for the worker to be ready.

**Example usage:**

- `"Start the dev server"`
- `"Run trigger dev"`

### stop\_dev\_server

Stop the running Trigger.dev dev server.

**Example usage:**

- `"Stop the dev server"`

### dev\_server\_status

Check the status of the dev server and view recent output. Shows whether it is stopped, starting, ready, or has errors.

**Example usage:**

- `"Is the dev server running?"`
- `"Show me the dev server logs"`
- `"Are there any build errors?"`

> **Warning**
>
> The deploy and list\_preview\_branches tools are not available when the MCP server is running with the `--dev-only` flag. The `--readonly` flag hides deploy, trigger\_task, and cancel\_run.

## Agent Chat Tools

These tools let you have conversations with [chat agents](https://trigger.dev/docs/ai-chat/overview) directly from your AI coding tool. See the [Agent MCP guide](https://trigger.dev/docs/ai-chat/mcp) for a walkthrough.

### list\_agents

List all chat agents registered in the current worker. Agents are tasks created with `chat.agent()` or `chat.customAgent()`.

**Example usage:**

- `"What agents are available?"`
- `"List my chat agents"`

### start\_agent\_chat

Start a conversation with a chat agent. Returns a chat ID for use with `send_agent_message`. Optionally preloads the agent so it initializes before the first message.

**Parameters:**

- `agentId` (required) — The agent task slug (e.g., `"support-agent"`)
- `chatId` (optional) — A custom conversation ID. Auto-generated if omitted
- `clientData` (optional) — Client data to include with every message (e.g., `{ userId: "user_123" }`). Must match the agent's `clientDataSchema` if one is defined
- `preload` (optional, default: `true`) — Whether to preload the agent before the first message

**Example usage:**

- `"Start a chat with the support agent"`
- `"Talk to the pr-review agent with userId abc"`

### send\_agent\_message

Send a message to an active agent chat and get the full response back. The agent remembers full context from previous messages in the same chat.

**Parameters:**

- `chatId` (required) — The chat ID from `start_agent_chat`
- `message` (required) — The message text to send

**Example usage:**

- `"Tell the agent to review the latest PR"`
- `"Ask it what tools it has available"`

### close\_agent\_chat

Close an agent chat conversation. The agent exits its loop gracefully. Without this, the agent will close on its own when its idle timeout expires.

**Parameters:**

- `chatId` (required) — The chat ID to close

**Example usage:**

- `"Close the chat"`
- `"End the conversation"`

> **Warning**
>
> The `start_agent_chat`, `send_agent_message`, and `close_agent_chat` tools are write operations and are not available in readonly mode.

## Session Channel Tools

Read and write a session's realtime streams: a named [side channel](https://trigger.dev/docs/ai-chat/side-channels) or the reserved chat transcript pair. Use these to observe an agent's out-of-band output (a screencast, telemetry) or to send it control input.

### read\_session\_channel

Read records from a session's realtime stream. By default it returns the records that exist right now after an optional cursor and closes, so it is a point-in-time drain, not a live subscription. Set `timeoutInSeconds` to wait for the next record when none exist yet.

**Parameters:**

- `sessionId` (required): the session id (`session_*`) or the externalId it was created with
- `channel` (optional): the named side channel to read. Omit to read the reserved chat transcript pair
- `io` (optional, default: `out`): which side to read, `out` (producer feed) or `in` (client input)
- `afterEventId` (optional): cursor. Only return records after this event id. Use the `nextCursor` from a prior read to page forward
- `maxRecords` (optional, default: `100`): maximum records to return
- `timeoutInSeconds` (optional): wait up to this many seconds for at least one record when none exist yet

**Example usage:**

- `"Read the latest frames on the screencast channel for this session"`
- `"Wait for the next control message on the session's status channel"`

### write\_session\_channel

Append one record to a named side channel's `in` stream. Sends control input to a running agent (e.g. a pause command) without waking or triggering a run. The reserved transcript and a channel's `out` side are not writable here; `out` is producer-only.

**Parameters:**

- `sessionId` (required): the session id or externalId
- `channel` (required): the named side channel to write to
- `value` (required): the record to append. Pass an object for a structured record (e.g. `{ paused: true }`) or a string for a raw one

**Example usage:**

- `"Pause the screencast on this session"`
- `"Send { paused: true } to the viewport channel"`

> **Warning**
>
> `write_session_channel` is a write operation and is not available in readonly mode.
