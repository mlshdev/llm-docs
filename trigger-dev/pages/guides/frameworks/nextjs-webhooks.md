# Triggering tasks with webhooks in Next.js

Learn how to trigger a task from a webhook in a Next.js app.

## Prerequisites

- [A Next.js project, set up with Trigger.dev](https://trigger.dev/docs/guides/frameworks/nextjs)
- [cURL](https://curl.se/) installed on your local machine. This will be used to send a POST request to your webhook handler.

## GitHub repo

- [View the project on GitHub](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/examples/tree/main/nextjs-webhooks/my-app)

  Click here to view the full code for this project in our examples repository on GitHub. You can
  fork it and use it as a starting point for your own project.

## Adding the webhook handler

The webhook handler in this guide will be an API route.

This will be different depending on whether you are using the Next.js pages router or the app router.

### Pages router: creating the webhook handler

Create a new file `pages/api/webhook-handler.ts` or `pages/api/webhook-hander.js`.

In your new file, add the following code:

```ts /pages/api/webhook-handler.ts
import { helloWorldTask } from "@/trigger/example";
import { tasks } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";

export default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  // Parse the webhook payload
  const payload = req.body;

  // Trigger the helloWorldTask with the webhook data as the payload
  await tasks.trigger<typeof helloWorldTask>("hello-world", payload);

  res.status(200).json({ message: "OK" });
}
```

This code will handle the webhook payload and trigger the 'Hello World' task.

### App router: creating the webhook handler

Create a new file in the `app/api/webhook-handler/route.ts` or `app/api/webhook-handler/route.js`.

In your new file, add the following code:

```ts /app/api/webhook-handler/route.ts
import type { helloWorldTask } from "@/trigger/example";
import { tasks } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  // Parse the webhook payload
  const payload = await req.json();

  // Trigger the helloWorldTask with the webhook data as the payload
  await tasks.trigger<typeof helloWorldTask>("hello-world", payload);

  return NextResponse.json("OK", { status: 200 });
}
```

This code will handle the webhook payload and trigger the 'Hello World' task.

## Triggering the task locally

Now that you have your webhook handler set up, you can trigger the 'Hello World' task from it. We will do this locally using cURL.

1. First, run your Next.js app.

   ```bash npm
   npm run dev
   ```

   ```bash pnpm
   pnpm run dev
   ```

   ```bash yarn
   yarn dev
   ```

   Then, open up a second terminal window and start the Trigger.dev dev server:

   ```bash npm
   npx trigger.dev@latest dev
   ```

   ```bash pnpm
   pnpm dlx trigger.dev@latest dev
   ```

   ```bash yarn
   yarn dlx trigger.dev@latest dev
   ```
2. To send a POST request to your webhook handler, open up a terminal window on your local machine and run the following command:

   > **Tip**
   >
   > If `http://localhost:3000` isn't the URL of your locally running Next.js app, replace the URL in
   > the below command with that URL instead.

   ```bash
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"Name": "John Doe", "Age": "87"}' http://localhost:3000/api/webhook-handler
   ```

   This will send a POST request to your webhook handler, with a JSON payload.
3. After running the command, you should see a successful dev run and a 200 response in your terminals.

   If you now go to your [Trigger.dev dashboard](https://cloud.trigger.dev), you should also see a successful run for the 'Hello World' task, with the payload you sent, in this case; `{"name": "John Doe", "age": "87"}`.
