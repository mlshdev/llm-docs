# AI media generation workflows

Learn how to use Trigger.dev for AI media generation including image creation, video synthesis, audio generation, and multi-modal content workflows

## Overview

Build AI media generation pipelines that handle unpredictable API latencies and long-running operations. Generate images, videos, audio, and multi-modal content with automatic retries, progress tracking, and no timeout limits.

## Featured examples

- [Product image generator](https://trigger.dev/docs/guides/example-projects/product-image-generator)

  Transform product photos into professional marketing images using Replicate.
- [Meme generator (human-in-the-loop)](https://trigger.dev/docs/guides/example-projects/meme-generator-human-in-the-loop)

  Generate memes with DALL·E 3 and add human approval steps.
- [Vercel AI SDK image generation](https://trigger.dev/docs/guides/example-projects/vercel-ai-sdk-image-generator)

  Generate images from text prompts using the Vercel AI SDK.

## Benefits of using Trigger.dev for AI media generation workflows

**Pay only for active compute, not AI inference time:** Checkpoint-resume pauses during AI API calls. Generate content that takes minutes or hours without paying for idle inference time.

**No timeout limits for long generations:** Handle generations that take minutes or hours without execution limits. Perfect for high-quality video synthesis and complex multi-modal workflows.

**Human approval gates for brand safety:** Add review steps before publishing AI-generated content. Pause workflows for human approval using waitpoint tokens.

## Production use cases

  Read how Icon uses Trigger.dev to process and generate thousands of videos per month for their AI-driven video creation platform.
- [Papermark customer story](https://trigger.dev/customers/papermark-customer-story)

  Read how Papermark process thousands of documents per month using Trigger.dev.

## Example workflow patterns

**Supervisor pattern with approval gate**. Generates AI content, pauses execution with wait.forToken to allow human review, applies feedback if needed, publishes approved content.

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[generateContent] --> B[createWithAI]
    B --> C[wait.forToken approval]
    C --> D{Approved?}

    D -->|Yes| E[publishContent]
    D -->|Needs revision| F[applyFeedback]
    F --> B
```

Simple AI image generation. Receives prompt and parameters, calls OpenAI DALL·E 3, post-processes result, uploads to storage.

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[generateImage] --> B[optimizeImage]
    B --> C[uploadToStorage]
    C --> D[updateDatabase]
```

**Coordinator pattern with rate limiting**. Receives batch of generation requests, coordinates parallel processing with configurable concurrency to respect API rate limits, validates outputs, stores results.

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[processBatch] --> B[coordinateGeneration]
    B --> C[batchTriggerAndWait]

    C --> D[generateImage1]
    C --> E[generateImage2]
    C --> F[generateImageN]

    D --> G[validateResults]
    E --> G
    F --> G

    G --> H[storeResults]
    H --> I[notifyCompletion]
```

**Coordinator pattern with sequential processing**. Generates initial content with AI, applies style transfer or enhancement, upscales resolution, optimizes and compresses for delivery.

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[processCreative] --> B[generateWithAI]
    B --> C[applyStyleTransfer]
    C --> D[upscaleResolution]
    D --> E[optimizeAndCompress]
    E --> F[uploadToStorage]
```
