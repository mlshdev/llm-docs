# Marketing workflows

Learn how to use Trigger.dev for marketing workflows, including drip campaigns, behavioral triggers, personalization engines, and AI-powered content workflows

## Overview

Build marketing workflows from email drip sequences to orchestrating full multi-channel campaigns. Handle multi-day sequences, behavioral triggers, dynamic content generation, and build live analytics dashboards.

## Featured examples

- [Email sequences with Resend](https://trigger.dev/docs/guides/examples/resend-email-sequence)

  Send multi-day email sequences with wait delays between messages.
- [Product image generator](https://trigger.dev/docs/guides/example-projects/product-image-generator)

  Transform product photos into professional marketing images using Replicate.
- [Human-in-the-loop workflow](https://trigger.dev/docs/guides/example-projects/human-in-the-loop-workflow)

  Approve marketing content using a human-in-the-loop workflow.

## Benefits of using Trigger.dev for marketing workflows

**Delays without idle costs:** Wait hours or weeks between steps. Waits over 5 seconds are automatically checkpointed and don't count towards compute usage. Perfect for drip campaigns and scheduled follow-ups.

**Guaranteed delivery:** Messages send exactly once, even after retries. Personalized content isn't regenerated on failure.

**Scale without limits:** Process thousands in parallel while respecting rate limits. Send to entire segments without overwhelming APIs.

## Production use cases

## Example workflow patterns

Simple drip campaign. User signs up, waits specified delay, sends personalized email, tracks engagement.

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[userCreateAccount] --> B[sendWelcomeEmail]
    B --> C[wait.for 24h]
    C --> D[sendProductTipsEmail]
    D --> E[wait.for 7d]
    E --> F[sendFeedbackEmail]

```

**Router pattern with delay orchestration**. User action triggers campaign, router selects channel based on preferences (email/SMS/push), coordinates multi-day sequence with delays between messages, tracks engagement across channels.

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[startCampaign] --> B[fetchUserProfile]
    B --> C[selectChannel]
    C --> D{Preferred<br/>Channel?}

    D -->|Email| E[sendEmail1]
    D -->|SMS| F[sendSMS1]
    D -->|Push| G[sendPush1]

    E --> H[wait.for 2d]
    F --> H
    G --> H

    H --> I[sendFollowUp]
    I --> J[trackConversion]
```

**Supervisor pattern with approval gate**. Generates AI marketing content (images, copy, assets), pauses with wait.forToken for human review, applies revisions if needed, publishes to channels after approval.

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[createCampaignAssets] --> B[generateAIContent]
    B --> C[wait.forToken approval]
    C --> D{Approved?}

    D -->|Yes| E[publishToChannels]
    D -->|Needs revision| F[applyFeedback]
    F --> B
```

**Coordinator pattern with enrichment**. User completes survey, batch triggers parallel enrichment from CRM/analytics, analyzes and scores responses, updates customer profiles, triggers personalized follow-up campaigns.

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[processSurveyResponse] --> B[coordinateEnrichment]
    B --> C[batchTriggerAndWait]

    C --> D[fetchCRMData]
    C --> E[fetchAnalytics]
    C --> F[fetchBehaviorData]

    D --> G[analyzeAndScore]
    E --> G
    F --> G

    G --> H[updateCRMProfile]
    H --> I[triggerFollowUp]
```
