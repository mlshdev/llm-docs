# Using the Vercel AI SDK

This example demonstrates how to use the Vercel AI SDK with Trigger.dev.

## Overview

The [Vercel AI SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ai) is a simple way to use AI models from many different providers, including OpenAI, Microsoft Azure, Google Generative AI, Anthropic, Amazon Bedrock, Groq, Perplexity and [more](https://sdk.vercel.ai/providers/ai-sdk-providers).

It provides a consistent interface to interact with the different AI models, so you can easily switch between them without needing to change your code.

## Generate text using OpenAI

This task shows how to use the Vercel AI SDK to generate text from a prompt with OpenAI.

### Task code

```ts trigger/vercel-ai-sdk-openai.ts
import { logger, task } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";
import { generateText } from "ai";
// Install the package of the AI model you want to use, in this case OpenAI
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai"; // Ensure OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is set

export const openaiTask = task({
  id: "openai-text-generate",

  run: async (payload: { prompt: string }) => {
    const chatCompletion = await generateText({
      model: openai("gpt-4-turbo"),
      // Add a system message which will be included with the prompt
      system: "You are a friendly assistant!",
      // The prompt passed in from the payload
      prompt: payload.prompt,
    });

    // Log the generated text
    logger.log("chatCompletion text:" + chatCompletion.text);

    return chatCompletion;
  },
});
```

## Testing your task

To test this task in the dashboard, you can use the following payload:

```json
{
  "prompt": "What is the meaning of life?"
}
```
