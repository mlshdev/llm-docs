# Writing tasks: Overview

Tasks are the core of Trigger.dev. They are long-running processes that are triggered by events.

Before digging deeper into the details of writing tasks, you should read the [fundamentals of tasks](https://trigger.dev/docs/tasks/overview) to understand what tasks are and how they work.
