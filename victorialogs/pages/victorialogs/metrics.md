## HTTP Request Metrics

### vl\_http\_requests\_total

**Type:** Counter

**Labels:**

- `path`: `/select/logsql/query`, `/insert/jsonline`, `/insert/loki/api/v1/push`, etc.
- `format`: `json`, `protobuf`

**Description:** HTTP requests arriving at VictoriaLogs endpoints. Counts all requests immediately when received, before any validation or authentication happens.

### vl\_http\_errors\_total

**Type:** Counter

**Labels:**

- `path`: endpoint path
- `format`: request format when applicable (e.g. `protobuf`)

**Description:** Errors encountered while processing requests for the given endpoint. The counter is incremented by endpoint handlers on non-trivial processing errors (e.g. request decoding/parsing failures or query execution errors) and may differ from the number of HTTP responses with error status. For line-oriented ingestion (e.g. `/insert/jsonline`), it is incremented per invalid log line inside a request.

### vl\_http\_request\_duration\_seconds

**Type:** Summary

**Labels:**

- `path`: endpoint path

**Description:** Complete time spent processing each HTTP request from start to finish. Includes all processing steps: parsing request data, validating parameters, storing logs, and sending responses. Captured when requests complete successfully.

## Data Ingestion Metrics

### vl\_rows\_ingested\_total

**Type:** Counter

**Labels:**

- `type`: `jsonline`, `loki`, `elasticsearch`, `datadog`, `opentelemetry`, `journald`, `syslog`

**Description:** Log entries successfully parsed and added to the processing pipeline. Counts all entries that pass initial validation, including debug entries that are processed but not stored when `debug=1` is used.

### vl\_bytes\_ingested\_total

**Type:** Counter

**Labels:**

- `type`: ingestion protocol

**Description:** Estimated JSON size of ingested log entry fields. Calculated using field name lengths and values to provide consistent volume measurement across different input formats like JSON, Loki, or syslog.

### vl\_rows\_dropped\_total

**Type:** Counter

**Labels:**

- `reason`: `debug`, `too_many_fields`, `too_big_timestamp`, `too_small_timestamp`

**Description:** Log entries rejected for specific reasons. `debug` counts entries processed with `debug=1` (parsed but not stored). `too_many_fields` counts entries exceeding `-insert.maxFieldsPerLine`. `too_small_timestamp` counts entries older than `-retentionPeriod`. `too_big_timestamp` counts entries newer than `-futureRetention`.

### vl\_insert\_flush\_duration\_seconds

**Type:** Summary

**Labels:**

### vl\_too\_long\_lines\_skipped\_total

**Type:** Counter

**Description:** Log lines exceeding `-insert.maxLineSizeBytes` (default 256KB) during parsing. Lines are skipped to prevent memory exhaustion. Indicates malformed data, overly verbose logs, or need to increase the size limit.

## Storage System Metrics

### vl\_data\_size\_bytes
