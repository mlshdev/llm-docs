# isEnabled (Swift)

```

## Discussion

When the value of this property is [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true), the gesture recognizer actively tracks touches and reports state changes to its action method. When the value of this property is [false](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false), the gesture recognizer does not track events or call its action method. The default value of this property is [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true).

If you change the value of this property to [false](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false) while the gesture recognizer is in the middle of tracking touch events, the gesture recognizer transitions to the [WKGestureRecognizerState.cancelled](../wkgesturerecognizerstate/cancelled.md) state.
