# presentController(\_:)

**Framework:** WatchKit  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** watchOS

Presents a page-based interface modally.

> Use [presentController(withNamesAndContexts:)](presentcontroller%28withnamesandcontexts_%29.md) instead.

## Declaration

```swift
@MainActor @nonobjc @preconcurrency final func presentController(_ namesAndContexts: [(name: String, context: AnyObject)])
```

## Parameters

- `namesAndContexts`: An array of tuples. Each tuple must contain the following named elements:

  - **name**: The name of the interface controller you want to display. In your storyboard, the name of an interface controller is stored in the object’s Identifier property, which is located in the attributes inspector. This element must not be `nil`.
  - **context**: An object to pass to the new interface controller. Use the object in this parameter to communicate important information to the new interface controller, such as the data to display or any relevant state information. You may specify `nil` for this element if you want but doing so is not recommended.

## Discussion

After calling this method, WatchKit loads and initializes the new interface controllers and animates them into position on top of the current interface controller. A modal interface slides up from the bottom of the screen and completely cover the previous interface. WatchKit displays the first interface controller in the `names` array initially. The user can navigate to the other interfaces by swiping horizontally.

The title of the modal interface is set to the string Cancel unless the presented interface controller explicitly changes it using the [setTitle(\_:)](settitle%28__%29.md) method. Tapping the title dismisses the interface automatically. To dismiss the interface programmatically, call the [dismiss()](dismiss%28%29.md) method.

Always call this method from your WatchKit extension’s main thread.
