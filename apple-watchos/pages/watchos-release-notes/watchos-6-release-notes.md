# watchOS 6 Release Notes

**Kind:** Article

Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

The watchOS 6 SDK provides support for developing watchOS apps for Apple Watch devices running watchOS 6. The SDK comes bundled with Xcode 11 beta available from [Beta Software Downloads](https://developer.apple.com/download/). For information on the compatibility requirements for Xcode 11, see [Xcode 11 Release Notes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-11-release-notes).

> **Warning**

> You must update your watch to watchOS 6 beta 2 or later before updating to iOS 13 beta 7 or later, otherwise your watch will no longer be able to connect to your phone. (52854192)

<a id="Networking"></a>

### Networking

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- To enhance security, [URLSession](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession) no longer sniffs the MIME type when the server sends `Content-Type: application/octet-stream`. (7820658)
- [NSURLRequest.CachePolicy.reloadRevalidatingCacheData](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsurlrequest/cachepolicy-swift.enum/reloadrevalidatingcachedata) and [NSURLRequest.CachePolicy.reloadIgnoringLocalAndRemoteCacheData](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsurlrequest/cachepolicy-swift.enum/reloadignoringlocalandremotecachedata) APIs are now available. (49660334)
- [URLSessionWebSocketTask](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsessionwebsockettask) and [URLSessionStreamTask](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsessionstreamtask) are now available for use in watchOS apps. (49779789)

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- The [urlSession(\_:taskIsWaitingForConnectivity:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsessiontaskdelegate/urlsession%28_:taskiswaitingforconnectivity:%29) delegate callback might not function as expected. (54309264)

<a id="Deprecations"></a>

#### Deprecations

- The [URLSession](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession) and [NSURLConnection](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsurlconnection) APIs no longer support SPDY. Servers should use HTTP 2 or HTTP 1.1. (43391641)

<a id="Notifications"></a>

### Notifications

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- To send a [User Notifications](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications) push to a watchOS device, a new `apns-push-type` key is now required as part of the APNs request header. Depending on the type of notification, this key can be set to `alert` or `background` and is supported across all Apple platforms. (47099534)

<a id="Podcasts"></a>

### Podcasts

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- Asking Siri to play a podcast on Apple Watch might result in an error message. (50392036)

<a id="SwiftUI"></a>

### SwiftUI

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- You can now create a [Color](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/color) from a [UIColor](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicolor) or [NSColor](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nscolor). (49833933)
- [NSManagedObject](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/nsmanagedobject) now conforms to [ObservableObject](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/observableobject). The new `@`[FetchRequest](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/fetchrequest) property wrapper can drive views from the results of a fetch request, and [managedObjectContext](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/environmentvalues/managedobjectcontext) is now included in the environment. (50280673)
- Gesture modifiers are renamed for consistency. For example, `tapAction(count:_:)` is renamed [onTapGesture(count:perform:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/ontapgesture%28count:perform:%29), and `longPressAction(minimumDuration:maximumDistance:_:pressing:)` is renamed [onLongPressGesture(minimumDuration:maximumDistance:pressing:perform:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/onlongpressgesture%28minimumduration:maximumdistance:pressing:perform:%29). (50395282)
- [Text](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/text) now has a default line limit of `nil` so that it wraps by default. (51147116)
- [ContentSizeCategory](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/contentsizecategory) and several other enumerations are now [CaseIterable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/caseiterable). (51168712)
- `SegmentedControl` is now a style of [Picker](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/picker). (51769046)
- `BindableObject` is replaced by the [ObservableObject](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/observableobject) protocol from the Combine framework. (50800624) You can manually conform to [ObservableObject](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/observableobject) by defining an [objectWillChange](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/observableobject/objectwillchange-5gopl) publisher that emits before the object changes. However, by default, [ObservableObject](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/observableobject) automatically synthesizes [objectWillChange](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/observableobject/objectwillchange-5gopl) and emits before any `@`[Published](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/published) properties change.

  ```swift
  // RoomStore.swift

  import Foundation

  class RoomStore: ObservableObject {
      @Published var rooms: [Room] = []
  }

  struct Room: Identifiable {
      var id: UUID
      var name: String
      var capacity: Int
      var hasVideo: Bool
  }

  // ContentView.swift
  import SwiftUI

  struct ContentView: View {
      @ObservedObject var store: RoomStore

      var body: some View {
          NavigationView {
              List(store.rooms) { room in
                  RoomCell(room: room)
              }
              .navigationBarTitle("Rooms")
          }
      }
  }
  ```

  ```@``ObjectBinding``` is replaced by `@`[ObservedObject](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/observedobject).
- The [EnvironmentValues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/environmentvalues) structure has four new properties for reading accessibility values from the environment: [accessibilityDifferentiateWithoutColor](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/environmentvalues/accessibilitydifferentiatewithoutcolor), [accessibilityReduceTransparency](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/environmentvalues/accessibilityreducetransparency), [accessibilityReduceMotion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/environmentvalues/accessibilityreducemotion), and [accessibilityInvertColors](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/environmentvalues/accessibilityinvertcolors). (51712481)
- The `color(_:)` modifier for [Text](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/text) is renamed [foregroundColor(\_:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/text/foregroundcolor%28_:%29) for consistency with the more general [foregroundColor(\_:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/foregroundcolor%28_:%29) view modifier. (50391847)
- The `BindableObject` protocol’s requirement is now `willChange` instead of `didChange`, and should now be sent before the object changes rather than after it changes. This change allows for improved coalescing of change notifications. (51580731)
- The [RangeReplaceableCollection](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/rangereplaceablecollection) protocol is extended to include a [remove(atOffsets:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/rangereplaceablecollection/remove%28atoffsets:%29) method and the [MutableCollection](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/mutablecollection) protocol is extended to include a [move(fromOffsets:toOffset:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/mutablecollection/move%28fromoffsets:tooffset:%29) method. Each new method takes [IndexSet](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/indexset) instances that you use with the `onMove(perform:)` and `onDelete(perform:)` modifiers on [ForEach](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/foreach) views. (51991601)
- Added improved presentation modifiers: [sheet(isPresented:onDismiss:content:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/sheet%28ispresented:ondismiss:content:%29), [actionSheet(isPresented:content:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/actionsheet%28ispresented:content:%29), and [alert(isPresented:content:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/alert%28ispresented:content:%29) — along with `isPresented` in the environment — replace the existing `presentation(_:)`, `Sheet`, `Modal`, and `PresentationLink` types. (52075730)
- Updated the APIs for creating animations. The basic animations are now named after the curve type — such as [linear](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/animation/linear) and [easeInOut](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/animation/easeinout). The interpolation-based `spring(mass:stiffness:damping:initialVelocity:)` animation is now [interpolatingSpring(mass:stiffness:damping:initialVelocity:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/animation/interpolatingspring%28mass:stiffness:damping:initialvelocity:%29), and `fluidSpring(stiffness:dampingFraction:blendDuration:timestep:idleThreshold:)` is now [spring(response:dampingFraction:blendDuration:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/animation/spring%28response:dampingfraction:blendduration:%29) or [interactiveSpring(response:dampingFraction:blendDuration:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/animation/interactivespring%28response:dampingfraction:blendduration:%29), depending on whether or not the animation is driven interactively. (50280375)
- Added an initializer for creating a [Font](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/font) from a [CTFont](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coretext/ctfont). (51849885)

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- SwiftUI has an API that lets you change the value type of [Binding](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/binding) to [AnyHashable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/anyhashable):

  ```swift
  let someBinding: Binding<String> = ...
  let typeErasedBinding = Binding<AnyHashable>(someBinding)
  ```

  Attempting to use this API at compile time results in a linker error on watchOS 6. (53769896)
- A [WKInterfaceObjectRepresentable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/wkinterfaceobjectrepresentable) instance with no explicit width might expand to the bounds of its container.

  **Workaround:** Wrap the [WKInterfaceObjectRepresentable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/wkinterfaceobjectrepresentable) instance in a [GeometryReader](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/geometryreader) to get an explicit width for the view. (53512858)
- [Image](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/image) instances don’t use resizing information configured in asset catalogs. Configure the size of an image using the [resizable(capInsets:resizingMode:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/image/resizable%28capinsets:resizingmode:%29) modifier instead. (49114577)

<a id="Deprecations"></a>

#### Deprecations

- SwiftUI APIs deprecated in previous betas are now removed. (52587863, 53310683)
- The `Length` type is replaced by [CGFloat](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corefoundation/cgfloat-swift.struct). (50654095)
- `TabbedView` is now named [TabView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/tabview). (51012120)
- `HAlignment` and `VAlignment` are now deprecated, use the more flexible [HorizontalAlignment](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/horizontalalignment) or [VerticalAlignment](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/verticalalignment) types instead and use [TextAlignment](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/textalignment) for text. (51190531)
- The `SelectionManager` protocol is removed, use [Optional](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/optional) and [Set](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/set) instances directly for selection. (51557694)
- The `isPresented` environment value is deprecated and replaced with the more general [presentationMode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/environmentvalues/presentationmode) value. (51641238)
- The `StaticMember` protocol is deprecated. Use protocol-conforming types directly instead. For example, use an instance of [WheelPickerStyle](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/wheelpickerstyle) directly rather than the `wheel` static member.(52911961)
- Complex overloads for the [background(\_:alignment:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/background%28_:alignment:%29) and [border(\_:width:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/border%28_:width:%29) modifiers are deprecated. Use shapes in a [background(\_:alignment:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/background%28_:alignment:%29) or [overlay(\_:alignment:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/overlay%28_:alignment:%29) to draw these instead. (53067530)
- The `identified(by:)` method on the [Collection](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/collection) protocol is deprecated in favor of dedicated `init(_:id:selection:rowContent:)` and `init(_:id:content:)` initializers. (52976883, 52029393)

  The retroactive conformance of Int to the [Identifiable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/identifiable) protocol is removed. Change any code that relies on this conformance to pass `\.self` to the `id` parameter of the relevant initializer. Constant ranges of [Int](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/int) continue to be accepted:

  ```swift
  List(0..<5) {
      Text("Rooms")
  }
  ```

  However, you shouldn’t pass a range that changes at runtime. If you use a variable that changes at runtime to define the range, the list displays views according to the initial range and ignores any subsequent updates to the range.
- Several extensions to the [Binding](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/binding) structure are removed. (51624798)

  If you have code such as the following:

  ```swift
  struct LandmarkList: View {
      var landmark: [Landmark]
      @Binding var favorites: Set<Landmark>

      var body: some View {
          List(landmarks) { landmark in
              Toggle(landmark.name, isOn: self.$favorites.contains(landmarkID))
          }
      }
  }
  ```

  Define the following subscript on the Set structure:

  ```swift
  extension Set {
      subscript(member: Element) -> Bool {
          get { contains(member) }
          set {
              if newValue {
                  insert(member)
              } else {
                  remove(member)
              }
          }
      }
  }
  ```

  Then, change `self.$favorites.contains(landmarkID)` to `self.$favorites[landmarkID]`.
- The [Binding](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/binding) structure’s conditional conformance to the Collection protocol is removed. (51624798)

  If you have code such as the following:

  ```swift
  struct LandmarkList: View {
      @Binding var landmark: [Landmark]

      var body: some View {
          List(landmarks) { landmark in
              Toggle(landmark.value.name, isOn: landmark[\.isFavorite])
          }
      }
  }
  ```

  Define the following collection type:

  ```swift
  struct IndexedCollection<Base: RandomAccessCollection>: RandomAccessCollection {
      typealias Index = Base.Index
      typealias Element = (index: Index, element: Base.Element)

      let base: Base

      var startIndex: Index { base.startIndex }

      var endIndex: Index { base.startIndex }

      func index(after i: Index) -> Index {
          base.index(after: i)
      }

      func index(before i: Index) -> Index {
          base.index(before: i)
      }

      func index(_ i: Index, offsetBy distance: Int) -> Index {
          base.index(i, offsetBy: distance)
      }

      subscript(position: Index) -> Element {
          (index: position, element: base[position])
      }
  }

  extension RandomAccessCollection {
      func indexed() -> IndexedCollection<Self> {
          IndexedCollection(base: self)
      }
  }
  ```

  Then, update your code to:

  ```swift
  struct LandmarkList: View {
      @Binding var landmarks: [Landmark]

      var body: some View {
          List(landmarks.indexed(), id: \.1.id) { (index, landmark) in
              Toggle(landmark.name, isOn: self.$landmarks[index].isFavorite)
          }
      }
  }
  ```
- The `relativeWidth(_:)`, `relativeHeight(_:)`, and `relativeSize(width:height:)` modifiers are deprecated. Use other modifiers like [frame(minWidth:idealWidth:maxWidth:minHeight:idealHeight:maxHeight:alignment:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/frame%28minwidth:idealwidth:maxwidth:minheight:idealheight:maxheight:alignment:%29) instead. (51494692)

### Xcode

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- If your watch debugging session continuously times out, you might need to quit and relaunch Xcode after connecting to the internet in order to download the appropriate DeviceSupport files. (50554987)
- The watchOS Mail app and related processes might quit unexpectedly when used within the Simulator. (53799899)
