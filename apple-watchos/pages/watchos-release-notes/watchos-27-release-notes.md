<a id="Network-Security"></a>

### Network Security

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- Starting in 27.0 operating systems, select system processes now enforce stricter network security (TLS) requirements. These new requirements might cause connections to fail if the server does not meet them. The affected processes are those involved in MDM, DDM, Automated Device Enrollment, configuration profile installation, app installation, and software updates. Servers must support TLS 1.2 at minimum, using cipher suites and certificates that meet App Transport Security (ATS) requirements.

  For additional details on affected processes, requirements, and how to audit and diagnose failures in managed environments, please reference [Prepare your network environment for stricter security requirements](https://support.apple.com/en-us/126655). For additional details on ATS and the new requirements, please reference [Preventing Insecure Network Connections](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Security/preventing-insecure-network-connections) and [NSRequiresNIAPTLSPackageVersion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/BundleResources/Information-Property-List/NSRequiresNIAPTLSPackageVersion). (176055825)

<a id="Security"></a>

### Security

<a id="Siri"></a>

### Siri

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: Siri might not resolve some entity types when your app has provided only an `EntityStringQuery` for the entity type. (177464215)
- Fixed: Siri AI might be unable to complete certain actions on Apple Watch for English users in locales outside the United States. (180303086)
- As of beta 5, Siri AI conversation history no longer syncs to devices running a prior beta. iCloud sync works between devices updated to beta 5. No existing conversations will be lost. (182145010)

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- Siri might appear to be listening when it is not after extended periods of silence while the Siri interface remains on screen. (180434572)
- Siri AI conversations might not sync to paired Apple Watch, failing with a “No iCloud is configured” error. (183040889)

  **Workaround:** On the Watch, open Settings \> Apple Account to trigger an account refresh and restores syncing.
- Apple Watch devices updated from an earlier beta might remain in a state where Siri conversation history does not sync with the paired iPhone. In most cases, the watch recovers on its own without any action. (183958361)

  **Workaround:** If syncing doesn’t resume, open Settings \> Apple Account on Apple Watch to trigger an account refresh.

<a id="Sleep-Focus"></a>

### Sleep Focus

- StoreKit now includes the `Transaction.OwnershipType.assigned` and `Transaction.RevocationType.assignmentRevoked` enum values to support volume purchases. `Transaction` query methods now additionally return transactions assigned to the Managed Apple Account. (156749517)
- New `Product.ProductType` APIs represent subscription Bundles and subscription Suites. New APIs in `Product.SubscriptionInfo.BundledSubscription` let you fetch merchandising data about subscriptions contained in a Bundle. Transaction and RenewalInfo contain new fields that provide information about purchases and customer status regarding Bundles and Suites. (160501742)
- `partnerName` and `partnerId` properties for Advanced Commerce API are available in [Transaction.AdvancedCommerceInfo](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/transaction/advancedcommerceinfo-swift.struct) and [RenewalInfo.AdvancedCommerceInfo](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/product/subscriptioninfo/renewalinfo/advancedcommerceinfo-swift.struct). (167808780)

- Fixed: The `SKTestSession` `disableDialogs` setting is not always respected for all system dialogs. (154390284) (FB18403150)
- Fixed: Subscription upgrades performed with the Xcode Transaction Manager are not reported in `Transaction.updates`. (160698598) (FB20269723)
- Fixed: The renewal behavior preference is not respected when using the `purchaseDate(_:renewalBehavior:)` purchase option to make purchases using `SKTestSession`. (162014134) (FB20537538)
- Fixed: Re-purchasing a previously refunded non-consumable fails with an already owned error when using StoreKit Testing in Xcode. (174560379) (FB22475017)
- Fixed: Using `pricingTerms.commitmentInfo.price` in StoreKit Testing in Xcode returns an incorrect price for monthly subscriptions with a 12-month commitment. (177942756)
- Fixed: Transactions for upgraded subscriptions are immediately marked as expired when using StoreKit Testing in Xcode. (178441109)
- Fixed: Purchases made with the original StoreKit API fail with an unknown error on watchOS. (178760994)
- Fixed: Intro offer eligibility does not reset immediately after calling `SKTestSession.clearTransactions()`. (183933307) (FB24137836)

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- Changing the storefront or locale using `SKTestSession` doesn’t propagate through `Storefront.updates`. (184155259)
- Failed purchases using `SKTestSession` might display error dialogs even when `dialogsDisabled` is set to true. (184255116)

<a id="Swift-Charts"></a>

### Swift Charts

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: When your project has a minimum deployment target lower than 27.0, using conditionals inside a `Chart` closure produces the warning “Conformance of `_ConditionalContent<TrueContent, FalseContent>` to `ChartContent` is only available in ‘’ 27.0 or newer,” and the app might crash at runtime when that content is loaded. (174168981)

<a id="SwiftUI"></a>

### SwiftUI

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- `AsyncImage` now automatically caches downloaded images using HTTP caching protocols, allowing servers to control caching behavior via standard headers. You can customize caching for specific images using the new `AsyncImage` initializers that accept `URLRequest` with custom `cachePolicy` settings. Additionally, you can set a custom `URLSession` using the new `View.asyncImageURLSession(_:)` API to control how all child `AsyncImage` views perform data tasks. (78212597)
- A `@State` declared with an expression as its initial value used to evaluate the expression each time the view struct re-instantiates. In the case of `@State private var model = Model()`, this means `Model.init()` gets called many times throughout the view’s lifetime. Xcode 27 introduces a new `@State` implementation that avoids this repeated evaluation. This new behavior back-deploys to iOS 17 aligned OSes. The new `@State` is implemented with a Swift macro. It is largely source compatible with the property wrapper version, with a few exceptions.

  If you provide an initial value at `@State` declaration, and also try to assign a value to it in an initializer, the initializer value is discarded. This behavior has not changed because of the macro, but some such cases no longer compile:

  ```
   struct StickerPageView: View {
       @State private var page = StickerPage()
       let title: String
   
       init(title: String) {
           // `title` won't have any effect
           // this also won't compile with @State macro
           self.page = StickerPage(title: title)
           self.title = title
       }
   }
  ```

  When assigning initial value via an initializer, do not provide an initial value at the @State declaration.

  ```
   struct StickerPageView: View {
       @State private var page: StickerPage // no initial value expression
       let title: String
   
       init(title: String) {
           self.page = StickerPage(title: title) // works!
           self.title = title
       }
   }
  ```

  When all stored members of a struct are private, the compiler synthesizes a private init that can be used in an extension of the same type:

  ```
   struct StickerPageView: View {
       @State private var page: StickerPage
       private let title: String
       ...
   }
   
   extension StickerPageView {
       init(title: String, _ page: StickerPage) {
           self.init(page: page, title: title) // using the synthesized init
       }
   }
  ```

  The state macro disables this synthesized initializer. So the code above no longer compiles. To mitigate, assign value to members explicitly:

  ```
   extension StickerPageView {
       init(title: String, _ page: StickerPage) {
           self.title = title
           self.page = page
       }
   }
  ```

  In rare situations, the automatic inference of generic arguments of `@State` is less flexible with the macro implementation. Write the type with more specificity.

  Composing `@State` with other property wrappers or macros is not supported. (105893279)
- You can now use the `TextInputBorderShape` type to customize the border shape of text input controls like `TextField` with the `textInputBorderShape(_:)` view modifier. The `.squareBorder` and `.roundedBorder` text field styles are soft deprecated — use the new `.bordered` text field style instead. (173362083)
- In apps built with the 27.0 SDKs, a `LabeledContent` view used inside a `Menu` maps its value to the platform menu item’s subtitle. (175594929)
- The @Entry macro now warns of potential issues if you store default class instances or closures in the environment. The SwiftUI Specialist skill in Xcode provides guidance for resolving these issues. (175902616)
- You can now access `concentricCornerRadii` and `concentricCornerRadii(in:)` on `GeometryProxy`. These APIs return the corner radii that are concentric with the view’s container shape as a `RectangleCornerRadii?`. You can use these values to drive custom drawing or layout that responds to the container’s corners without rendering a `ConcentricRectangle` directly. (177185166)
- `@ContentBuilder` type checking performance is further improved for valid code compared to Beta 1. (177526032)
- The new data item or error object based `alert` and `confirmationDialog` modifiers can now be used by projects targeting iOS 15.0, macOS 12.0, tvOS 15.0, watchOS 8.0, and visionOS 1.0. (179388848)

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: When you apply both `.fileExporter(_:...)` and `.fileMover(_:...)` modifiers to a view, some dialogs might not present correctly. (154080867)
- Fixed: In apps built with the watchOS 27.0 SDK, `TabView.selection` updates only after the user has scrolled or rotated the Digital Crown past the 50% threshold between two pages, rather than as soon as the offset begins to change. (163517317)
- Fixed: In apps built with the 27.0 SDKs, `containerRelativeFrame(_:alignment:)` incorrectly accounts for safe-area insets on a `ScrollView`’s non-scrollable axis, causing the calculated scrollable content size to be too small. For example, a view using `containerRelativeFrame(.vertical)` inside a horizontal `ScrollView` extends into vertical safe-area regions, such as the navigation bar and home indicator, because only the scrollable axis insets are applied. (165913417)
- Fixed: Certain control-related view modifiers unexpectedly affect sheet and popover content. In apps built with the 27.0 SDKs, the `controlSize`, `buttonSizing`, `buttonRepeatBehavior`, `menuIndicatorVisibility`, and `ButtonBorderShape` environment values are now reset to their default values in sheets and popovers. (167448274)
- Fixed: A Button containing both an icon and a title placed inside a `List` `Section` header or footer has incorrect spacing between its icon and title. (175681345)
- Fixed: `@State` variable named using a raw identifier fails to compile. (179149051) (FB23015259)

<a id="System"></a>

### System

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- System now provides Swift APIs for the C `stat`, `lstat`, `fstat`, and `fstatat` system calls. This includes a new `Stat` type with initializers from `FilePath`, `FileDescriptor`, or a C string; `FilePath.stat()` and `FileDescriptor.stat()` instance methods; and supporting types (`FileType`, `FileMode`, `FileFlags`, `UserID`, `GroupID`, `DeviceID`, and `Inode`). See [SYS-0006](https://github.com/apple/swift-system/blob/main/Proposals/0006-system-stat.md) for more details. (160612181)

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: Custom `FilePath` or `FileDescriptor` extensions that make unqualified calls to `stat()` or `stat(_)` (without the `Darwin.` qualification) might conflict with the new Swift `stat()` instance methods introduced in [SYS-0006](https://github.com/apple/swift-system/blob/main/Proposals/0006-system-stat.md), causing build errors. See [SYS-0008](https://github.com/apple/swift-system/blob/main/Proposals/0008-backdeploy-cinterop-stat.md) for more details. (177911316)
