<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- Users who were previously on 9.2.1 build may experience issues of missing Medication Schedule on Watch, or Medication dose logged on Watch not appearing on Phone (106108448)

  **Workaround:** \1) On companion iPhone: remove the affected medication schedule and re-add it. Or 2) On affected Watch: erase and reinstall as new device any releases after 9.2.1

### SwiftUI

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: `ScrollView` has improved support for right to left languages by default. If you have a `ScrollView` that shouldn’t change its behavior in right to left languages, use the `.environment(\.layoutDirection, .leftToRight)` modifier to ensure the `ScrollView` always sees a left to right layout direction. (65108729)
- Fixed: Presentations in SwiftUI using the ‘sheet’ or ‘fullScreenCover’ modifier can now be dynamically presented again while a dismiss animation is in progress. Previously, attempting to present again in this case would do nothing.

  Note: A data race in app code that was previously ignored might cause a sheet to be presented again with this change. If this happens, check that your state isn’t triggering a new presentation. (101487810)
