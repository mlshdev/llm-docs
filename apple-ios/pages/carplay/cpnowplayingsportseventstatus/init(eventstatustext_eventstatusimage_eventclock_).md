# init(eventStatusText:eventStatusImage:eventClock:) (Swift)

**Framework:** CarPlay  
**Kind:** Initializer  
**Availability:** iOS 18.4+ · iPadOS 18.4+ · Mac Catalyst 18.4+

Initialize an event status with optional event status text, an optional event status image, and an optional event clock.

## Declaration

```swift
init(eventStatusText: [String]?, eventStatusImage: UIImage?, eventClock: CPNowPlayingSportsClock?)
```

## Parameters

- `eventStatusText`: Up to three separate strings for event status may be displayed.
- `eventStatusImage`: An optional event status image for this event, if it applies to this event. For example, a baseball game could display a representation of the bases and outs, indicating how many bases are loaded and the number of outs in the current inning.
- `eventClock`: The event timer, if it applies to this event. See @c CPNowPlayingSportsClock.

## Discussion

The first string should always be used to show the play period (quarter, inning, period) using as few characters as possible; e.g. “2nd” for the 2nd quarter.

The second and third strings can be used to display additional information, like “1st & 10” and “SF 15” for an American football game.

All three strings should be kept as brief as possible to ensure they display well on car screens of various sizes.
