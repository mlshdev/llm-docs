# image (Swift)

**Framework:** CarPlay  
**Kind:** Instance Property

## Discussion

Provide an image that is display-ready. If necessary, provide light and dark variants using an asset catalog, or use an instance of [UIImageAsset](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimageasset) and register an image for each interface style. To properly size your image, use the display scale of the vehicle’s primary screen, which you access from your interface controller’s [carTraitCollection](../cpinterfacecontroller/cartraitcollection.md) property.

CarPlay doesn’t support animated images. If you provide an animated image, CarPlay uses only the first image in the animation sequence.
