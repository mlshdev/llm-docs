# listImageRowHandler (Swift)

**Framework:** CarPlay  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 14.0+ · iPadOS 14.0+ · Mac Catalyst 14.0+

An optional closure that CarPlay invokes when the user selects an image.

## Declaration

```swift
var listImageRowHandler: ((CPListImageRowItem, Int, @escaping () -> Void) -> Void)? { get set }
```

## Discussion

In Swift, this property is a closure that has three parameters:

- The list item that contains the image.
- The selected image’s index in the list item’s image row.
- The completion closure you call to notify CarPlay when you finish processing the selection.

In Objective-C, the block’s parameters are:

- **`item`**: The list item that contains the image.
- **`index`**: The selected image’s index in the list item’s image row.
- **`completionBlock`**: The block you call to notify CarPlay when you finish processing the selection.

CarPlay executes your handler on the main queue. You must call the completion closure, or `completionBlock` in Objective-C, after you finish processing the selection. If you need to perform asynchronous tasks, dispatch them to a background queue and call the completion closure or `completionBlock` when they complete. CarPlay displays an asynchronous progress indicator until you call the completion closure.
