## Discussion

When a person attempts to install an app with an age rating that exceeds the maximum allowed for the device, the framework presents a sheet that enables the person to request an exception from a parent or guardian. When the person proceeds with the request, the framework adds an instance of [AppLibrary.ExceptionRequest](exceptionrequest.md) for the app to this list.

The parent or guardian reviews the request in Messages on their device, or in person on the originating device, by responding to a system-provided sheet. After the parent or guardian makes a decision, the framework removes the app’s [AppLibrary.ExceptionRequest](exceptionrequest.md) from this list.

Keep the person informed of the [status](exceptionrequest/status-swift.property.md) of the current exception requests. For example, if the exception status is [AppLibrary.ExceptionRequest.Status.pending](exceptionrequest/status-swift.enum/pending.md), you can show a Pending label in place of an Install button for the associated app.
