## Discussion

This installation scheme defines how your webpage requests the installation of your app. For example, assign a URL with the following scheme to a Download button on your page:

```
marketplace-kit://install
    ?alternativeDistributionPackage=<url>
    &installVerificationToken=<install verification token>    
    &token=<authentication token>
    &account=<user id>
    &appShareURL=<URL>;
```

The URL parameters are:

| URL parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `alternativeDistributionPackage` | Your app’s alternative distribution package in the assembled format described in [Ingesting an alternative distribution package](ingesting-an-alternative-distribution-package.md). |
| `installVerificationToken` | A required JSON web signature (JWS). For more information, see [Supplying an install verification token](supplying-an-install-verification-token.md). |
| `token` | An optional authentication token to include if downloads require authorization. iOS sends the token back to your token endpoint to reference this request. The value is free-form, and can contain any information at your discretion, such as an id that identifies the customer. |
| `account` | An optional user ID for the page visitor. iOS groups apps in restore requests based on `account`. iOS also provides the `account` as `login_hint` for the authorization call during interactive re-authentication; for more information, see [Reauthenticating a person to manage apps](reauthenticating-a-person-to-manage-apps.md). |
| `appShareURL` | An optional URL to a product landing page for the app on your marketplace website. The operating system populates the value in the Share Sheet when a person touches and holds the app’s icon on the Home Screen. |

Web browsers recognize the scheme and hand off the installation request to [MarketplaceKit](../marketplacekit.md). For more information, see [Installing your app from your website](installing-your-app-from-your-website.md).

## Setting the alternative distribution package parameter

The fully qualified domain in the `alternateDistributionPackage` value needs to match the fully qualified domain of the *referrer*, that is, the page that contains the `marketplace-kit://` link. This domain also needs to match the domain you supply to App Store Connect. For more information, see [Alternative Distribution Domains](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/alternative-distribution-domains). For example:

- **Domain in App Store Connect**: `mydomain.com`
- **Your webpage root domain**: `mymarketplace.mydomain.com`
- **`alternateDistributionPackage` value**: `https://mymarketplace.mydomain.com/path`

> **Note**

> To allow installation, the web browser also needs to support the app installation URL scheme. If you develop a browser app, see [Enabling alternative distribution app installation in a browser](enabling-alternative-distribution-app-installation-in-a-browser.md) for more information.
