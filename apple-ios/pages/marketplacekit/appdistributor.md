## Overview

Apps on alternative app marketplaces need to use APIs that vary from apps on the App Store. Specifically, use:

- [AdAttributionKit](../adattributionkit.md) for ads.
- An e-commerce solution other than the App Store’s [In-App Purchase](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/in-app-purchase) system.
- A social gaming network other than [Game Center](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/game-center) unless your app is also on the App Store.
- [Background Assets](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/backgroundassets) to download large files in the background rather than [On Demand Resources](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/On_Demand_Resources_Guide/).

To observe API differences, check the value of the app distributor’s static ([current](appdistributor/current.md)) property to determine the installation source:

| App distributor case | Installation source |
| --- | --- |
| [AppDistributor.appStore](appdistributor/appstore.md) | The App Store |
| [AppDistributor.testFlight](appdistributor/testflight.md) | TestFlight |
| [AppDistributor.marketplace(\_:)](appdistributor/marketplace%28__%29.md) | Alternative app marketplace; the argument `String` identifies the marketplace bundle ID |
| [AppDistributor.web](appdistributor/web.md) | The developer’s website |
| [AppDistributor.other](appdistributor/other.md) | Enterprise or education developer programs |

API availability varies depending on the source, so your app needs to check the current source at each launch — not just at the first launch — and adjust the APIs it uses accordingly.

In addition, for apps that aren’t marketplaces, use [eligibilityRegion](appdistributor/eligibilityregion.md) to determine if an Apple Account is signed in that has a region eligible for transaction reporting.
