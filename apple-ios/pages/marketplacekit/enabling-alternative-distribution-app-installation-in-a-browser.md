# Enabling alternative distribution app installation in a browser

**Framework:** MarketplaceKit  
**Kind:** Article

Add support for browser apps to install alternative distribution apps from websites.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

To enable the installation of an alternative distribution app from a webpage, your browser listens for installation requests from the website visitor’s interaction with the page and hands off the request to [MarketplaceKit](../marketplacekit.md). The installation request uses a specific URL scheme ([MarketplaceKitURIScheme](marketplacekiturischeme.md)) that the marketplace page assigns to a button. [MarketplaceKit](../marketplacekit.md) handles the request by presenting the app install sheet, in which the person can confirm and install the alternative distribution app on their device.

[MarketplaceKit](../marketplacekit.md) requires a one-to-one mapping between an alternative distribution app and the domain of the website that distributes it. When a page visitor taps a button to install the app, your browser app passes the origin of the site’s main frame to [MarketplaceKit](../marketplacekit.md), which confirms that the owner of the domain also owns the app.

> **Note**

> The system requires that your browser app have a specific entitlement to call the [MarketplaceKit](../marketplacekit.md) installation method. For more information and to request the entitlement, see [com.apple.developer.browser.app-installation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com.apple.developer.browser.app-installation).

## Respond to app installation requests using BrowserEngineKit

Browsers that render using [BrowserEngineKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/browserenginekit) hand off app installation requests to [MarketplaceKit](../marketplacekit.md). Your browser listens for invocations to a URL with the scheme `MarketplaceKit/MarketplaceKitURIScheme`:

```
marketplace-kit://install
    ?alternativeDistributionPackage=<url>
    &installVerificationToken=<install verification token>
    &token=<authentication token>
    &account=<user id>
    &appShareURL=<URL>;
```

The URL parameters are:

| URL parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `alternativeDistributionPackage` | The app to install in the form of an alternative distribution package. |
| `installVerificationToken` | A required JSON web signature (JWS). |
| `token` | An optional authentication token. |
| `account` | An optional user ID for the page visitor. |
| `appShareURL` | An optional URL to a product landing page for the app on the marketplace website. |

For more information about the parameters, see [MarketplaceKitURIScheme](marketplacekiturischeme.md).

To forward the navigation request to [MarketplaceKit](../marketplacekit.md), call the [requestAppInstallationFromBrowser(for:referrer:)](applibrary/requestappinstallationfrombrowser%28for_referrer_%29.md) method to display the app install sheet and pass in the following parameters:

| URL parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `url` | The unparsed [MarketplaceKitURIScheme](marketplacekiturischeme.md) URL that triggers the installation request. |
| `referrer` | The origin of the main frame that contains the alternative marketplace installation URL. |

> **Important**

>  To comply with operation system requirements, ignore the `marketplace-kit://` URL invocation if the navigation doesn’t result from a user interaction, such as tapping a button, or if the navigation results from a redirect.

## Respond to app installation requests using WebKit

If your browser app uses [WebKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit), modify your app’s [webView(\_:decidePolicyFor:decisionHandler:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wknavigationdelegate/webview%28_:decidepolicyfor:decisionhandler:%29-2ni62) navigation delegate method. When the system calls the delegate method with a URL matching the  `MarketplaceKitURIScheme` scheme, call the `decisionHandler` with a value of `WKNavigationActionPolicyAllow`.

Don’t call the [requestAppInstallationFromBrowser(for:referrer:)](applibrary/requestappinstallationfrombrowser%28for_referrer_%29.md) method directly. WebKit handles the interaction with [MarketplaceKit](../marketplacekit.md) after you call the navigation delegate’s `decisionHandler` with a value of `WKNavigationActionPolicyAllow`.

Safari is an example of a browser app that uses [WebKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit). When a person taps on an `MarketplaceKitURIScheme` URL, it calls Safari’s [webView(\_:decidePolicyFor:decisionHandler:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wknavigationdelegate/webview%28_:decidepolicyfor:decisionhandler:%29-2ni62) navigation delegate method with a URL matching the `MarketplaceKitURIScheme`. Safari responds by calling `decisionHandler` with `WKNavigationActionPolicyAllow`, which then causes WebKit to pass the URL to MarketplaceKit and display an install sheet.

## Test web distribution during development

In iOS 18.2 and later, development builds of browser apps with the default browser entitlement ([com.apple.developer.web-browser](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com.apple.developer.web-browser)) can test the installation of web-distributed marketplace apps. A development build signed with a development or Ad Hoc provisioning profile can run on Simulator and all physical devices that the target region supports. For region-based caveats, see [Participating in alternative distribution for specific regions](participating-in-alternative-distribution-for-specific-regions.md).
