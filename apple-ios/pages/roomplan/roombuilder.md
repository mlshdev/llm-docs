# RoomBuilder

**Framework:** RoomPlan  
**Kind:** Class  
**Availability:** iOS 16.0+ · iPadOS 16.0+ · Mac Catalyst 16.0+

An object that generates a 3D asset from room-capture data.

## Declaration

```swift
class RoomBuilder
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

This class processes data from an earlier scan to generate a detailed [CapturedRoom](capturedroom.md) object.

Your app receives raw captured room data ([CapturedRoomData](capturedroomdata.md)) through:

- The view delegate ([RoomCaptureViewDelegate](roomcaptureviewdelegate.md)) callback [captureView(shouldPresent:error:)](roomcaptureviewdelegate/captureview%28shouldpresent_error_%29.md) for an app that provides room-scanning features through the framework-provided view ([RoomCaptureView](roomcaptureview.md)).
- The scan session ([RoomCaptureSession](roomcapturesession.md)) callback [captureSession(\_:didEndWith:error:)](roomcapturesessiondelegate/capturesession%28__didendwith_error_%29.md) for an app that provides room-scanning features by displaying its own view.

Your app generates a detailed captured room object by calling [capturedRoom(from:)](roombuilder/capturedroom%28from_%29.md) on the raw data. Your app can then inspect or modify this data before exporting the scanned room to a USDZ file.

## Topics

### Creating a room builder

- [init(options:)](roombuilder/init%28options_%29.md): Creates a room builder using the specified options.
- [RoomBuilder.ConfigurationOptions](roombuilder/configurationoptions.md): Options that configure a room builder.

### Processing a prior scan

- [capturedRoom(from:)](roombuilder/capturedroom%28from_%29.md): Processes the specified raw scan results and returns a detailed representation of the room.

### Handling errors

- [RoomBuilder.BuildError](roombuilder/builderror.md): Errors that can occur during captured room-data processing.
