# Captured Object Attributes (Swift)

**Framework:** RoomPlan  
**Kind:** API Collection

Determine details about the objects and surfaces that the framework identifies in a scan.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

Each [CapturedRoom.Object](capturedroom/object.md) contains attributes that the framework observes during a scan that convey details about the object. For example, an object of category [CapturedRoom.Object.Category.chair](capturedroom/object/category-swift.enum/chair.md) may contain the attributes [ChairType.stool](chairtype/stool.md) and [ChairLegType.star](chairlegtype/star.md), which describes the framework’s observations of the chair during the scan. An object exposes these details through its [attributes](capturedroom/object/attributes.md) array.

By reading the attribute information the framework sets on objects, your app can provide more informed utility with a scanned room, such as:

- A filtered list of product selections in a furniture catalog that matches just the categories and attributes of the present objects in the room.
- A more accurate visual representation, for example when rendering a virtual reality experience, by substituting the default object bounding boxes with detailed 3D models that your app chooses.

> **Tip**

> If you export a scan result to USDZ, for example, with [export(to:metadataURL:modelProvider:exportOptions:)](capturedroom/export%28to_metadataurl_modelprovider_exportoptions_%29.md), objects output as bounding boxes. To substitute the boxes with detailed 3D models based on object attributes, see [CapturedRoom.ModelProvider](capturedroom/modelprovider.md).

## Topics

### Accessing object details

- [CapturedRoomAttribute](capturedroomattribute.md): Details about an object in the room that the framework observes during a scan.
- [CapturedElementCategory](capturedelementcategory.md): The category of the particular object or surface.

### Describing chairs

- [ChairType](chairtype.md): Types of chair that the framework identifies in a captured room.
- [ChairArmType](chairarmtype.md): Types of armchair the framework identifies in a captured room.
- [ChairLegType](chairlegtype.md): Types of chair legs the framework identifies in a captured room.
- [ChairBackType](chairbacktype.md): Types of chair back the framework identifies in a captured room.

### Describing sofas

- [SofaType](sofatype.md): Types of sofa the framework identifies in a captured room.

### Describing closets

- [StorageType](storagetype.md): Types of storage area that the framework identifies in a captured room.

### Describing tables

- [TableType](tabletype.md): Types of table the framework identifies in a captured room.
- [TableShapeType](tableshapetype.md): Different table shapes that the framework identifies in a captured room.

### Captured Data

- [Merging multiple scans into a single structure](merging-multiple-scans-into-a-single-structure.md): Export a 3D model that consists of multiple rooms captured in the same physical vicinity.
- [Scanning the rooms of a single structure](scanning-the-rooms-of-a-single-structure.md): Create an AR experience that enables people to scan a building that contains multiple rooms.
- [CapturedRoom](capturedroom.md): A structure that provides the key details of a scanned room.
- [CapturedStructure](capturedstructure.md): An object that holds the results of the merger of multiple capture sessions.
- [CapturedRoomData](capturedroomdata.md): An opaque object that holds the raw results of a scan.
