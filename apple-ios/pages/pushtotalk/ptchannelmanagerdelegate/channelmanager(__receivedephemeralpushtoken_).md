# channelManager(\_:receivedEphemeralPushToken:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Push to Talk  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 16.0+ · iPadOS 16.0+ · Mac Catalyst 16.0+

Tells the observer that the app received a push token after you create a channel manager.

## Declaration

```swift
func channelManager(_ channelManager: PTChannelManager, receivedEphemeralPushToken pushToken: Data)
```

## Parameters

- `channelManager`: The channel manager.
- `pushToken`: The ephemeral push token.

## Mentioned In

- [Creating a Push to Talk app](../creating-a-push-to-talk-app.md)

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

The framework provides a token to this method after you initialize [PTChannelManager](../ptchannelmanager.md). The token isn’t active until a person joins the channel. If they leave the channel, you need to wait until they rejoin to resume notifications.

> **Important**

>  Don’t cache device tokens in local storage. The Apple Push Notification service issues a new token when a person restores a device from a backup, installs your app on a new device, or reinstalls the operating system.

When you send push notifications, the `apns-topic` header field needs to contain your app’s bundle identifier wit`h` the `.voip-ptt` suffix.
