# channelManager(delegate:restorationDelegate:completionHandler:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Push to Talk  
**Kind:** Type Method  
**Availability:** iOS 16.0+ · iPadOS 16.0+ · Mac Catalyst 16.0+

Creates a channel manager with the configuration you specify.

## Declaration

```swift
class func channelManager(delegate: any PTChannelManagerDelegate, restorationDelegate: any PTChannelRestorationDelegate, completionHandler: @escaping @Sendable (PTChannelManager?, (any Error)?) -> Void)
```

```swift
class func channelManager(delegate: any PTChannelManagerDelegate, restorationDelegate: any PTChannelRestorationDelegate) async throws -> PTChannelManager
```

## Parameters

- `delegate`: An object that conforms to the channel manager protocol.
- `restorationDelegate`: An object that conforms to the channel resoration protocol.
- `completionHandler`: The completion callback handler.

  - **`manager`**: A new channel manager instance.
  - **`error`**: An error, if any, that indicates the reason why the system couldn’t create the channel manager.

You must create a channel manager as soon as possible when launching your app so the system is able to restore existing challenge and deliver push notifications to your [PTChannelManagerDelegate](../ptchannelmanagerdelegate.md). By providing the restoration delegate, you decide whether to rejoin or leave any previously active channel the system knows about.
