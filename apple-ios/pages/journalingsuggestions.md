## Overview

Journaling Suggestions provides a visual picker interface for iPhone apps. The picker displays personal events that occur in someone’s life, such as a place they visited, a person they connected with, a photo in their library, or a song that they play repeatedly.

If your app facilitates personal writing, display the picker to provide people with ideas for their creative content. When someone chooses a suggestion from the picker, the system makes high-level details about the event available to your app. For example, a journaling app uses the details to display the beginning of a new journal entry about the selected suggestion.

To incorporate a suggestions picker ([JournalingSuggestionsPicker](journalingsuggestions/journalingsuggestionspicker.md)) in your app, declare it using [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui), and choose the text for a button that presents the picker.

For the picker to appear, your app needs a special entitlement in your app’s code signature. You don’t need to ask for additional authorization because your app can’t access the details for a suggestion until after a person chooses to share them by making a selection in the picker.

> **Note**

> Mac apps built with Mac Catalyst ignore input if someone taps a suggestions picker button.
