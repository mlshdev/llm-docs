**Framework:** AppMigrationKit

## Declaration

```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Use this type in unit tests that your containing app hosts. Calling the tester from your unit tests allows you to communicate with your app migration extension to valdiate your migration code.

In your tests, create an instance of `AppMigrationTester`, then access its [exportController](appmigrationtester/exportcontroller.md) and [importController](appmigrationtester/importcontroller.md) properties to exercise export and import functionality, respectively.

> **Warning**

> Use `AppMigrationTester` only in unit tests, not in production code. The tester doesn’t operate in a production environment.

## Topics

- [AppMigrationTester.AppExportController](appmigrationtester/appexportcontroller.md): A class you use to test your extension’s export code.

### Testing import

- [importController](appmigrationtester/importcontroller.md): An instance of the controller object you use to test your import code.
