## Overview

The iOS & iPadOS 16.2 SDK provides support to develop apps for iPhone and iPad running iOS & iPadOS 16.2. The SDK comes bundled with Xcode 14.2, available from the Mac App Store. For information on the compatibility requirements for Xcode 14.2, see [Xcode 14.2 Release Notes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-14_2-release-notes).

#### New Features

- Disable animations of `NavigationStack` push and pop by wrapping path mutation in `withTransaction(transaction) { … }` where `transaction` has `disablesAnimations` set to `true`. (88993253)

<a id="Deprecations"></a>

#### Deprecations

- In order to improve compiler type-checking performance, we’ve deprecated some `Table` initializers. They’re replaced with initializers which require an additional parameter that explicitly specifies the type they generate their contents from. This improves type-check performance by avoiding the need to infer a shared type from the bodies of separate closure parameters. For now, these initializers are deprecated. In a future release, those deprecation warnings will become errors. The new initializers add the parameter `of:`.

  The new initializers add the parameter `of:`. The following shows a Table before, and after adoption of the new API:

  ```swift
  // before (will now produce an error):
  Table {
    TableColumn("Name", value: \.name)
    TableColumn("Email", value: \.email)
  } rows: {
    ForEach(people) { person in
        TableRow(person)
    }
  }

  // after:
  Table(of: Person.self) {
    TableColumn("Name", value: \.name)
    TableColumn("Email", value: \.email)
  } rows: {
    ForEach(people) { person in
        TableRow(person)
    }
  }
  ```
