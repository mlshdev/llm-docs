## Overview

To develop apps for iOS & iPadOS 14.6, build your apps against the iOS 14.5 SDK or later. The SDK comes bundled with Xcode 12.5, available from the Mac App Store. For information on the compatibility requirements for Xcode 12.5, see [Xcode 12.5 Release Notes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-12_5-release-notes).

Up to five other ad networks receive a postback with a `did-win` value of `false` if their ad impressions qualified for, but didn’t win, the attribution. (72917087)

### Xcode

<a id="Deprecations"></a>

#### Deprecations

- Don’t use the iOS [MinimumOSVersion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information-property-list/minimumosversion) information property list key to declare the minimum release of macOS in which your app runs. Use [LSMinimumSystemVersion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information-property-list/lsminimumsystemversion) instead. (73890473)

  - Future releases of macOS ignore the `MinimumOSVersion` key in Mac apps, including apps built with Mac Catalyst.
  - Future releases of macOS use the `LSMinimumSystemVersion` key in iOS apps built with Xcode 12.5 or later. If an iOS app doesn’t include an `LSMinimumSystemVersion` key, future releases of macOS compare the app’s `MinimumOSVersion` with the version of its Mac Catalyst runtime to determine compatibility.
