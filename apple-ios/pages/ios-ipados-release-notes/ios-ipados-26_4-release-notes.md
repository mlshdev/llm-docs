### Accessory Notifications

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

### AudioAccessoryKit

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

<a id="Background-Assets"></a>

### Background Assets

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- You can now check the status of an asset pack while offline by calling `localStatus(ofAssetPackWithID:)` or `assetPackIsAvailableLocally(withID:)` on the shared asset pack manager. The former method returns all available status information. The latter returns only a Boolean value but can be called synchronously. Not all status information is available offline.  (164498466)
- You can make the latest version of an asset pack available locally by calling `ensureLocalAvailability(of:requireLatestVersion:)` on the shared asset pack manager and passing `true` to the `shouldUpdate` parameter.  (166237389)

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: Apps might crash when downloading asset packs.  (169648111)

<a id="Messages"></a>

### Messages

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- In this beta, RCS end-to-end encryption will become available for testing between Apple and Android devices. This feature is not shipping in this release and will be available to customers in future iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS 26 releases. End-to-end encryption is in beta and is not available for all devices or carriers. Conversations labeled as encrypted are encrypted end-to-end, so messages can’t be read while they’re sent between devices.  (170160585)

<a id="Networking"></a>

### Networking

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: Multiple processes leak `CFRunLoopSource` objects when Automatic proxy configuration (PAC) or Auto proxy discovery are configured.

  For clients of the `CFNetworkExecuteProxyAutoConfigurationURL` and `CFNetworkExecuteProxyAutoConfigurationScript` API, please check to make sure your process is not working around the leak by overreleasing the `CFRunLoopSourceRef` returned by those functions or the `CFArrayRef` and `CFErrorRef` passed to the completion.  (166839810) (FB21376045)

<a id="Reality-Composer"></a>

### Reality Composer

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- Reality Composer iOS can no longer export projects as `.reality` or USDZ. Opening export menu results in an empty panel.  (170091896)

<a id="StoreKit"></a>

### StoreKit

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- New fields [revocationType](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/transaction/revocationtype-swift.property) and [revocationPercentage](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/transaction/revocationpercentage) have been added to [Transaction](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/transaction).  (148858551)

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: Purchase Intents might not be emitted from the intents sequence when the app is launched from the background.  (168958783) (FB21767675)

<a id="SwiftUI"></a>

### SwiftUI

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: SwiftUI does not surface the latest `.userActivity` as the current user activity.  (163136831)

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- Multiple implicit SwiftUI animations (triggered by `RealityViewContent.animate` or `Entity.animate`) that modify a RealityKit component’s properties, are combined only when the implicit animations target the same set of component properties.

  For example, if you initiate an implicit animation on Transform.scale and then initiate an implicit animation on Transform.scale and Transform.translation then the animations affecting the scale property will be independent of each other, and will not combine. In this case, the most recently initiated animation will overwrite the scale property.  (169723142)

  **Workaround:** Ensure the same component properties are animated by subsequent implicit animations when possible.

### UIKit

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>
