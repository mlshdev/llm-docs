## Overview

The iOS & iPadOS 13.3 SDK provides support for developing apps for iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch devices running iOS & iPadOS 13.3. The SDK comes bundled with Xcode 11.3 available from the Mac App Store. For information on the compatibility requirements for Xcode 11.3, see [Xcode 11.3 Release Notes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-11_3-release-notes).

### Networking

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- Certain top-level domains (TLDs) such as `.dev` and `.app` are now in the Foundation [URLSession](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession) and [NSURLConnection](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsurlconnection) HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) preload list. An app which uses [URLSession](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession) to visit a matching URL will always navigate to the URL as `https://`, and never as cleartext `http://`. See the [HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) Specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797) for more information about HSTS. (56247242)
