<a id="Core-AI"></a>

### Core AI

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- iOS 27 includes Neural Engine improvements for Apple Intelligence capable devices. The system now restricts background access to the Neural Engine, similar to GPU usage restrictions. Large model loading (over 1 GB) performance is improved on the Neural Engine. Neural Engine memory usage is now attributed to your app process instead of the system, and appears in the Allocations instrument. (174796039)
- Access to the Neural engine when your app is in the background requires the new entitlement: “com.apple.developer.background-tasks.continued-processing.inference”. (179282606)

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: `AIModelCache` entries might not honor the cache policy you provide, causing re-specialization to occur more often than expected. (169746264)
- Fixed: When inference runs on the GPU, `InferenceFunction.encode` blocks until all compute is complete instead of returning as soon as encoding is done, unless the model is specialized with a preferred compute device of GPU. (175789258)
- Fixed: Certain weight and activation configurations may not run on the Neural Engine, such as FP8-quantized weights and activations, palettized weights with quantized (non-Float16) values, and sparse weights. Affected models may run on the CPU or GPU instead. (176210080)
- Fixed: When you run `InferenceFunction.run` on functions with both state arguments and outputs with dynamic shapes, the framework might be unable to infer the shape of the outputs and throw an error. (176807213)
- Fixed: On-device specialization fails when loading an `.aimodel` converted with `coreai-torch` v0.4.0. (177008303)
- Fixed: Inference might fail or crash for models with control flow over dynamic-shape tensors (for example, linear-attention LLMs such as Qwen3.5/3.6). (177354777)
- Fixed: Ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation might fail unexpectedly for certain models. (177729331)
- Fixed: When Metal API Validation is enabled, CoreAI models might fail to execute. (177991751)
- Fixed: Models with custom Metal kernels will fail to load. (178056451)
- Fixed: App-group support might not work as expected on certain model types. (179732320)
- Fixed: On-device specialization might fail when loading an `.aimodelc` compiled ahead of time using Xcode 27 Beta 2 or earlier. (181264112)

<a id="Core-Bluetooth"></a>

### Core Bluetooth

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: The Channel Sounding API in Core Bluetooth is not returning ranging results. (178333845)

<a id="Core-Spotlight"></a>

### Core Spotlight

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- Creating a SpotlightSearchTool without a configuration and using it with a LanguageModelSession backed by the on-device system language model fails with an error reporting that the number of tokens provided exceeds the maximum allowed. The tool’s default configuration is sized for models with large context windows, so the tool’s description and parameter schema alone exceed the on-device model’s context window before any prompt is added. (183770678)

  **Workaround:** Configure the tool with a focused guide, which uses a compact schema sized for the on-device model:

  ```
    let configuration = SpotlightSearchTool.Configuration(
      sources: [.coreSpotlight],
      guide: .focused()
    )
    let tool = SpotlightSearchTool(configuration: configuration)
  ```

  To search a specific kind of content, pass a domain: `.focused(.communications)`, `.focused(.calendar)`, `.focused(.documents)`, `.focused(.visualMedia)`, or `.focused(.audio)`. A focused guide exposes a smaller set of search capabilities than the default configuration. Sessions backed by a model with a larger context window can continue to use the default configuration.

<a id="Developer-Settings"></a>

### Developer Settings

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: Deep links into Settings \> Developer \> Paired Macs might silently fail to navigate to the target Mac computer. The Paired Macs pane loads correctly when entered manually. (178063365)

<a id="Dictation"></a>

### Dictation

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- Dictation can now be powered by a new on-device model that boosts accuracy. To enable this, go to Keyboard settings \> Dictation and Toggle on “Advanced Dictation Preview”. (178444388)

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: The “New Line” and “All Caps” formatting commands might not work reliably in the dictation UI. (177959708)
- Fixed: When you explicitly dictate punctuation— such as “Period” or “Colon” — both the spoken command word and the punctuation character might be inserted instead of the punctuation character alone. (178078177)
- Fixed: Dictation might not recognize names from your contacts. (178079519)
- Fixed: Dictation might insert extra words at the end of a dictated passage that you did not speak. (178269104)

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

- Updated HealthKit permissions flow now lets users grant apps access to limited history or full history. (172310874)
- HealthKit adds support for tracking menopausal state and bleeding after menopause; two new sample types are available. `HKCategoryTypeIdentifierMenopausalState` records a person’s current menopausal state. Values defined by `HKCategoryValueMenopausalState` are `menopause`, `perimenopause`, and `none`. `HKCategoryTypeIdentifierBleedingAfterMenopause` records bleeding episodes occurring after menopause. Values use the existing vaginal bleeding flow levels: `unspecified`, `light`, `medium`, and `heavy`. Both types are read/write, classified under Reproductive Health, and require the standard HealthKit category type authorization. (178532053)

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

<a id="MetricKit"></a>

### MetricKit

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- `CrashDiagnostic` now includes a `terminationCategory` that maps to the corresponding case in `ForegroundTerminationMetric` and `BackgroundTerminationMetric`. (96078210) (FB10494149)
- Apps that emit developer-defined states through the `StateReporting` framework now receive metrics and diagnostics in the context of those states. (159889985)
- `MemoryExceptionDiagnostic` are available when your app or app extension is terminated for exceeding its memory limit. (159890067)
- A new application-level `MetalFrameRateMetric` is available for Metal frame pacing rendering insights per `CAMetalLayer`. (159890165)
- A new Swift-first `MetricManager` API enables your app to receive `MetricReport` and `DiagnosticReport` objects through `AsyncStream`. `MetricReport` contains a daily aggregated entry along with interval-based breakdowns that are typically a few hours each. (164439529)
- `LocationActivityTimeMetric` now includes a `reducedAccuracy` property that reports the time your app spent tracking location using reduced accuracy (`kCLLocationAccuracyReduced`). Xcode’s simulated metric payloads also include sample data for this accuracy level, so you can test against it before your app receives real reports. (170513251)
- `HitchTimeMetric.ratio` and `SignpostIntervalMetric.hitchTimeRatio` now use the new `HitchTimeRatio` type, a `Dimension` subclass that expresses hitch time as a ratio of milliseconds hitching per second of tracked duration. Recompile your app with the latest SDK to pick up this type change and avoid any crashes on launch. (180024784) (FB23242495)

<a id="Deprecations"></a>

#### Deprecations

- The original MetricKit APIs — including `MXMetricManager`, `MXMetricManagerSubscriber`, `MXMetricPayload`, and `MXDiagnosticPayload` — are no longer recommended for new adoption. Use `MetricManager` instead. (174892111)
- The `scrollHitchTime(_:)` case of `MetricResult` and the `ScrollHitchTimeMetric` type are no longer part of the new Swift MetricKit API, and `MetricReport` values no longer contain scroll hitch entries. Use the `hitchTime(_:)` case and `HitchTimeMetric` instead, which report per-app animation hitch time. Recompile your app with the latest SDK to avoid a missing symbol crash if it references `ScrollHitchTimeMetric` or `scrollHitchTime(_:)`. (180455992)

<a id="Nearby-Interaction"></a>

### Nearby Interaction

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: The Channel Sounding API in Nearby Interaction does not return ranging results. (178073051)

<a id="Network-Security"></a>

### Network Security

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- Starting in 27.0 operating systems, select system processes now enforce stricter network security (TLS) requirements. These new requirements might cause connections to fail if the server does not meet them. The affected processes are those involved in MDM, DDM, Automated Device Enrollment, configuration profile installation, app installation, and software updates. Servers must support TLS 1.2 at minimum, using cipher suites and certificates that meet App Transport Security (ATS) requirements.

  For additional details on affected processes, requirements, and how to audit and diagnose failures in managed environments, please reference [Prepare your network environment for stricter security requirements](https://support.apple.com/en-us/126655). For additional details on ATS and the new requirements, please reference [Preventing Insecure Network Connections](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Security/preventing-insecure-network-connections) and [NSRequiresNIAPTLSPackageVersion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/BundleResources/Information-Property-List/NSRequiresNIAPTLSPackageVersion).

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- If an app intent uses Duration or `LPLinkMetadata`, creating a shortcut with that intent and then attempting to edit it with “Describe a change” might fail. (166068090)

  **Workaround:** If the model discards the action, press “Undo” to recover the unsupported intent.
- When an app intent defines a `UnionValue` parameter with two number-related types (for example, both Int and Double), the number option appears twice in the parameter picker menu and shows as double-selected. (168315587)

  **Workaround:** Define only one number-related type in the `UnionValue` parameter (for example, use only Int or only Double, not both).

- Fixed: You might encounter build failures when attempting to implement a Transferable `IntentValueRepresentation` for `PHAsset`. (178276448)
- Fixed: When asking Siri to call, message, or email a contact, Siri might fail to resolve the correct person — particularly when multiple contacts share the same name, when group names contain emoji or special characters, or when relationship labels (e.g., “my brother”) are ambiguous. In some cases, Siri might pick the wrong contact, fail to present a disambiguation prompt, or freeze during the disambiguation UI. (178379209)
- Fixed: For Report a Concern flows started with Siri, the text in attachments might be difficult to read while in Dark Mode. (178381615)
- Fixed: Businesses with overnight hours might display as “Closed till \[next day\]” even during open hours. (178384054)

- Fixed: Siri encounters an error when asked to compose emails if the Mail app is not open in the background. (181041601)
- As of beta 5, Siri AI conversation history no longer syncs to devices running a prior beta. iCloud sync works between devices updated to beta 5. No existing conversations will be lost. (182145010)

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- After Siri returns photo search results and you select photos, Siri might not detect which photos are selected on screen. Commands like “Send these” might apply to all photos returned from the search rather than only the selected ones. (171728298)

  **Workaround:** Open Photos, select the photos you want to act on, then perform the action using Siri — for example, “Send these photos to Bob”.
- Siri doesn’t support voice commands to interact with specific photos. For example, you can’t refer to photos by number, such as “photo one” or “photo four.” (176812955)

  **Workaround:** Use the photo picker to select the photo you want, or tap to select photos directly.
- When you ask Siri for Maps information, the response snippets might appear incomplete or display formatting issues. (177116121)

  **Workaround:** Ask Siri to repeat the information, or open Maps directly for complete details.
- When you ask Siri to add photos to an album, the confirmation prompt and spoken response might report or display more photos than will actually be added. (177376984)

  **Workaround:** Add photos to the album manually in the Photos app: tap Select, tap the photos you want to add, tap the Share button, tap Add to Album, then tap the album.
- Non-SF Symbol custom images for entities might not appear in Siri results for third-party apps. (177984074)
- When you ask Siri to read your last message, Siri might read an unread message from an unknown sender, such as spam, instead of the most recent message from a known contact. (178049066)

  **Workaround:** Name the sender in your request – for example, “Read my last message from .”
- Siri might respond more slowly than expected in CarPlay, particularly under higher device temperatures or poor network conditions. (178274714)

  **Workaround:** Try the request again after the device has cooled down or once you are in an area with better cellular reception.
- Siri might cut off the end of words during navigation. (181266301)

  **Workaround:** Reduce voice expressivity from the fastest pace, or turn off expressive voices.

<a id="SwiftUI"></a>

### SwiftUI

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- You can now use `.toolbarColorScheme(colorScheme, for: .statusBar)` to set a preferred status bar color scheme. (55162154) (FB7234376)
- `AsyncImage` now automatically caches downloaded images using HTTP caching protocols, allowing servers to control caching behavior via standard headers. You can customize caching for specific images using the new `AsyncImage` initializers that accept `URLRequest` with custom `cachePolicy` settings. Additionally, you can set a custom `URLSession` using the new `View.asyncImageURLSession(_:)` API to control how all child `AsyncImage` views perform data tasks. (78212597)
- In apps built with the iOS 27.0 and iPadOS 27.0 SDKs, a `Text` view with `.textSelection(.enabled)` applied now supports user-interactive selection using the system text selection UI. Previously, selectable `Text` views on iOS and iPadOS offered selection functionality through a callout menu. When building with the iOS 27.0 and iPadOS 27.0 SDKs, selectable `Text` views might include additional gestures for system text selection interactions. Consider using `.highPriorityGesture()` for custom gestures applied to `Text` views that should supersede system text selection gestures. (79770704) (FB9208920)
- A `@State` declared with an expression as its initial value used to evaluate the expression each time the view struct re-instantiates. In the case of `@State private var model = Model()`, this means `Model.init()` gets called many times throughout the view’s lifetime. Xcode 27 introduces a new `@State` implementation that avoids this repeated evaluation. This new behavior back-deploys to iOS 17 aligned OSes. The new `@State` is implemented with a Swift macro. It is largely source compatible with the property wrapper version, with a few exceptions.

  If you provide an initial value at `@State` declaration, and also try to assign a value to it in an initializer, the initializer value is discarded. This behavior has not changed because of the macro, but some such cases no longer compile:

  ```
   struct StickerPageView: View {
       @State private var page = StickerPage()
       let title: String
   
       init(title: String) {
           // `title` won't have any effect
           // this also won't compile with @State macro
           self.page = StickerPage(title: title)
           self.title = title
       }
   }
  ```

  When assigning initial value via an initializer, do not provide an initial value at the @State declaration.

  ```
   struct StickerPageView: View {
       @State private var page: StickerPage // no initial value expression
       let title: String
   
       init(title: String) {
           self.page = StickerPage(title: title) // works!
           self.title = title
       }
   }
  ```

  When all stored members of a struct are private, the compiler synthesizes a private init that can be used in an extension of the same type:

  ```
   struct StickerPageView: View {
       @State private var page: StickerPage
       private let title: String
       ...
   }
   
   extension StickerPageView {
       init(title: String, _ page: StickerPage) {
           self.init(page: page, title: title) // using the synthesized init
       }
   }
  ```

  The state macro disables this synthesized initializer. So the code above no longer compiles. To mitigate, assign value to members explicitly:

  ```
   extension StickerPageView {
       init(title: String, _ page: StickerPage) {
           self.title = title
           self.page = page
       }
   }
  ```

  In rare situations, the automatic inference of generic arguments of `@State` is less flexible with the macro implementation. Write the type with more specificity.

  Composing `@State` with other property wrappers or macros is not supported. (105893279)
- In apps built with the iOS 27.0 and macOS 27.0 SDKs, selectable `Text` views now support `TextRenderer`. (158160386) (FB19589465)
- In apps built with the 27.0 SDKs, the new `ReadableDocument` and `WritableDocument` protocols support asynchronous reading and writing, progress reporting, and direct access to document URLs. New `DocumentGroup` initializers that adopt these protocols let you disable document creation for editing-only apps and present custom UI before any document is opened. The initializers expose an `Observable` `URLDocumentConfiguration` and integrate with Swift concurrency and the `Observation` framework. New applications should prefer `ReadableDocument` and `WritableDocument` over `ReferenceFileDocument`, which remains available. (158441552)
- In apps built with the iOS 27.0 and iPadOS 27.0 SDKs, a `TabView` enforces that its selection is set to a visible tab. `TabView` might crash when its selection is set to a hidden or otherwise unavailable tab. (164516837)
- You can use `.toolbarVisibility(hideStatusBar ? .hidden : .automatic, for: .statusBar)` to conditionally hide the status bar. (165329279)
- The menu bar on iPadOS 27.0 and macOS 27.0, as well as context menus on macOS 27.0, present a reduced set of menu item images. By default, SwiftUI now hides all menu item symbol images in most contexts, while non-symbol images remain visible. Review the updated Human Interface Guidelines to determine which menu items in your app should still display images. Use the `labelStyle(_:)` view modifier with the `.titleAndIcon` style to indicate that a menu item `Label`’s icon should always be shown — such as when the menu item represents an object or a concept rather than an action. SwiftUI continues to automatically provide default visible menu item images for certain common system-wide menu items, such as Settings, Share, and Print. (170480710)
- The `TabsPickerStyle` style is now available for pickers that represent tab-based navigation and content selection. This style is similar to the `.segmented` style, but VoiceOver reads it as “tabs,” and on macOS it has a distinct visual appearance that distinguishes it from pickers that represent value selection — for example, a text alignment picker in an inspector. (173211711)
- You can now use the `TextInputBorderShape` type to customize the border shape of text input controls like `TextField` with the `textInputBorderShape(_:)` view modifier. The `.squareBorder` and `.roundedBorder` text field styles are soft deprecated — use the new `.bordered` text field style instead. (173362083)
- In apps built with the iOS 27.0 SDK, you can display non-interactive content on external display scenes using the `.sceneAccessory` view modifier with an `ExternalNonInteractiveAccessory` type. (175548901)
- In apps built with the 27.0 SDKs, a `LabeledContent` view used inside a `Menu` maps its value to the platform menu item’s subtitle. (175594929)
- The @Entry macro now warns of potential issues if you store default class instances or closures in the environment. The SwiftUI Specialist skill in Xcode provides guidance for resolving these issues. (175902616)
- You can now access `concentricCornerRadii` and `concentricCornerRadii(in:)` on `GeometryProxy`. These APIs return the corner radii that are concentric with the view’s container shape as a `RectangleCornerRadii?`. You can use these values to drive custom drawing or layout that responds to the container’s corners without rendering a `ConcentricRectangle` directly. (177185166)
- You can now use the `Document` protocol for representing documents in `DocumentGroup`. This protocol combines `ReadableDocument` and `WritableDocument` for common read-and-write cases. Use `Document` instead of `ReferenceFileDocument` and `FileDocument`, which are now deprecated. (177458781)
- `@ContentBuilder` type checking performance is further improved for valid code compared to Beta 1. (177526032)
- You can use `toolbarMinimizationBehavior` to control bar minimization behavior. This modifier replaces `toolbarMinimizeBehavior`. (177954148)
- The new data item or error object based `alert` and `confirmationDialog` modifiers can now be used by projects targeting iOS 15.0, macOS 12.0, tvOS 15.0, watchOS 8.0, and visionOS 1.0. (179388848)
- In macOS apps built with the macOS 27 SDK, the action retrieved from the `\.newDocument` environment value accepts an in-memory `ReadableDocument` produced by an autoclosure. SwiftUI presents a new document window populated with the supplied instance, instead of invoking the document group’s default factory. Use this to implement “New from Template” commands and similar flows. (180300890)
- A new `fileExporter(isPresented:documents:contentTypes:onCompletion:onCancellation:)` modifier exports a collection of values that conform to `WritableDocument` whose `Writer.Destination` is `URL`. The system presents a single export dialog, writes each document to the chosen destination, and reports the resulting URLs through `onCompletion`. (180301165)
- The `makeFileWrapper` closure of `FileWrapperDocumentWriter` now receives a second argument, `previous: FileWrapper?`, holding the `FileWrapper` from the document’s most recent read or write when one is available. Package documents can mutate `previous` in place and return it so that `FileWrapper` only writes children whose contents changed, avoiding rewriting an entire package on every save. Documents stored as a single file can ignore the second argument and return a fresh `FileWrapper` as before. Existing call sites must update their closures to accept the new parameter. (180301399)
- `DocumentReader.Source` and `DocumentWriter.Destination` now default to `URL`. Conforming types that read from or write to a file URL no longer need to declare `typealias Source = URL` or `typealias Destination = URL`. (180301692)

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: In apps built with the 2027 SDKs, tapping the status bar to scroll a `ScrollView` to its top correctly updates a bound `scrollPosition`. Previously, the binding could be left holding a stale value because the scroll-to-top transition didn’t drive the scroll-phase updates that propagate to the binding. (111501113) (FB12477370)
- Fixed: A custom `TextRenderer` applied via `.textRenderer(_:)` now takes effect on a `Text` view that also has `.textSelection(.enabled)` applied. Previously, the custom renderer was dropped on selectable text, falling back to default rendering. (151015350)
- Fixed: When you apply both `.fileExporter(_:...)` and `.fileMover(_:...)` modifiers to a view, some dialogs might not present correctly. (154080867)
- Fixed: In apps built with the 27.0 SDKs, `containerRelativeFrame(_:alignment:)` incorrectly accounts for safe-area insets on a `ScrollView`’s non-scrollable axis, causing the calculated scrollable content size to be too small. For example, a view using `containerRelativeFrame(.vertical)` inside a horizontal `ScrollView` extends into vertical safe-area regions, such as the navigation bar and home indicator, because only the scrollable axis insets are applied. (165913417)
- Fixed: Retroactive conformances of SwiftUI types to Equatable are not consulted when SwiftUI compares their values. (167443223)
- Fixed: Certain control-related view modifiers unexpectedly affect sheet and popover content. In apps built with the 27.0 SDKs, the `controlSize`, `buttonSizing`, `buttonRepeatBehavior`, `menuIndicatorVisibility`, and `ButtonBorderShape` environment values are now reset to their default values in sheets and popovers. (167448274)
- Fixed: `Menu` labels cannot contain controls, views with gestures, or view representables with gesture recognizers. (169091260)
- Fixed: A Button containing both an icon and a title placed inside a `List` `Section` header or footer has incorrect spacing between its icon and title. (175681345)
- Fixed: When you present a `fullScreenCover` with a `.navigationTransition(_:)` and set `@FocusState` to `true` via `.onAppear`, the keyboard does not animate concurrently with the zoom transition. Instead, it waits for the entire zoom animation to complete before the keyboard begins animating up, resulting in a visually jarring 2-step animation. (178421089)
- Fixed: `@State` variable named using a raw identifier fails to compile. (179149051) (FB23015259)
- The `read(from:progress:)` and `write(content:to:previous:progress:)` requirements of `DocumentReader` and `DocumentWriter` are declared with `@concurrent` instead of `nonisolated`. With approachable-concurrency defaults that infer `MainActor` isolation, an unannotated `nonisolated` async method runs on the main actor, defeating the intent of off-main reading and writing. Conforming types that previously used `nonisolated` should switch to `@concurrent` to match. (180302015)
- The `makeDocument:` and `makeReadableDocument:` closures passed to `DocumentGroup` initializers are now `@MainActor`-isolated. SwiftUI invokes these factories on the main actor when constructing a document instance, allowing the closure body to access main-actor state — including the supplied `URLDocumentConfiguration` — without hopping isolation domains. (180302065)
- `URLDocumentConfiguration` is a `@MainActor`-isolated `@Observable` reference type and no longer conforms to `Sendable`. Code that captured a configuration in a `Sendable` closure or stored it in a `Sendable` value should drop the constraint and access the configuration on the main actor. (180302075)

#### Known Issues

- Progress reported in `DocumentReader.read(from:progress:)` and `DocumentWriter.write(snapshot:to:previous:progress:)` might not be presented. (158441261)

<a id="Deprecations"></a>

#### Deprecations

- The `FileDocument` protocol is deprecated. Use `ReadableDocument` for read-only documents or `Document` for documents that support reading and writing. (178776840)

<a id="System"></a>

### System

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- System now provides Swift APIs for the C `stat`, `lstat`, `fstat`, and `fstatat` system calls. This includes a new `Stat` type with initializers from `FilePath`, `FileDescriptor`, or a C string; `FilePath.stat()` and `FileDescriptor.stat()` instance methods; and supporting types (`FileType`, `FileMode`, `FileFlags`, `UserID`, `GroupID`, `DeviceID`, and `Inode`). See [SYS-0006](https://github.com/apple/swift-system/blob/main/Proposals/0006-system-stat.md) for more details. (160612181)

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: Custom `FilePath` or `FileDescriptor` extensions that make unqualified calls to `stat()` or `stat(_)` (without the `Darwin.` qualification) might conflict with the new Swift `stat()` instance methods introduced in [SYS-0006](https://github.com/apple/swift-system/blob/main/Proposals/0006-system-stat.md), causing build errors. See [SYS-0008](https://github.com/apple/swift-system/blob/main/Proposals/0008-backdeploy-cinterop-stat.md) for more details. (177911316)

<a id="UIKit"></a>

### UIKit

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- When linked on iOS 27, tvOS 27, macCatalyst 27, or visionOS 27 SDKs, you can use `UIScene.extendStateRestoration` and `UIScene.completeStateRestoration` to extend state restoration for `UIScene.ActivationState.background` to `UIScene.ActivationState.foreground` lifecycle transitions. (161843040)
- iOS and iPadOS apps built with the 27.0 SDK or later are required to include a launch screen. Your app’s `Info.plist` must contain one of the following keys: `UILaunchStoryboardName`, `UILaunchStoryboards`, `UILaunchScreen`, or `UILaunchScreens`. Apps that don’t include a launch screen are rejected when the App Store begins accepting apps built with the 27.0 SDK. (168247372)
- On iOS 27.0 and iPadOS 27.0, Siri can load resources from drag interactions installed in your app’s interface. For example, when Apple Intelligence is invoked from a context menu, the system calls `UIDragInteractionDelegate` methods to load the content. Because drag sessions might begin without a user-initiated drag gesture, avoid performing animations or presenting modal UI for the drag in `dragInteraction(_:sessionWillBegin:)`. Instead, perform those actions in `dragInteraction(_:sessionDidMove:)`. (168884200)
- In apps built with the iOS 27.0 SDK, a presented view controller inherits its trait collection by walking up its view’s superview chain through the intermediate views of the presentation, rather than jumping directly to the presentation controller. Custom `UIPresentationController` subclasses or view controllers that depend on receiving traits directly from the presentation controller might need to update how they propagate or override `traitCollection`. (170005251)
- On iPadOS 27.0 and macOS 27.0, the menu bar and context menus present a reduced set of menu item images and do not display images set on menu elements by default. You can use the new `preferredImageVisibility` property on `UIMenuElement` — including updated initializers on `UIMenu`, `UIAction`, `UICommand`, and `UIKeyCommand` — to customize the visibility of each element’s image in these menus. Review the updated Human Interface Guidelines to determine which menu elements in your app should display images. UIKit automatically provides default visible menu element images for certain common system-wide menu items, such as Settings, Share, and Print. (170479084)
- In apps built with the iOS 27.0 SDK, when `UISearchController` uses center search-bar placement, the scope bar appears inline on the same row as the search field rather than on a separate row beneath it. When the search field is hosted inside a navigation bar, the scope bar sits inline beside the search field within that navigation bar. (173860616)
- In apps built with the iOS 27.0 SDK, `windowExternalDisplayNonInteractive` scenes are no longer offered automatically by the system. Use `UIViewController.registerSceneAccessory(_:)` with a `UISceneAccessory.externalNonInteractive` instance to display non-interactive content on external display scenes. (177015874)
- Use `UINavigationItem.navigationBarMinimization` to control navigation bar minimization behavior. This property replaces `UINavigationItem.barMinimizeBehavior` and `UINavigationItem.barMinimizationSafeAreaAdjustment`. (177953926)
- The container view of a `UIScrollEdgeElementContainerInteraction` may contribute its size and position to the overall shape of the scroll edge effect. (179191941) (FB23027596)

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: In apps built with the iOS 27.0 SDK, the deprecated status bar accessors on `UIApplication`  — including `statusBarFrame`, `statusBarOrientation`, `statusBarStyle`, and `isStatusBarHidden` — might return NaN or null values. (162044221)
- Fixed: On iPad, if your iPad app is built with the iOS 27 SDK and its `UISupportedInterfaceOrientations` doesn’t include all four interface orientations, the app is treated as non-continuously resizable. Beginning with iOS 27, supported interface orientations should no longer be a condition for continuous resizability. (166422120)
- Fixed: The `UISceneClosureConfirmation` API does not present a confirmation dialog. (169108042)
- Fixed: The `UIMenuLeaf` protocol is missing the subtitle property introduced in iOS 16.0. (173271862)
- Fixed: The background might not appear on a bottom toolbar when you use `UIBarButtonItem.hidesSharedBackground` to hide a toolbar item’s glass background. (174773785)
- Fixed: In iPhone Mirroring, if your app is built with the iOS 27 SDK its scene will support all interface orientations regardless of the orientations declared in `UISupportedInterfaceOrientations` or returned by `UIViewController.supportedInterfaceOrientations`. Supported interface orientations should be honored until the user begins resizing the window. (178555304)
- Fixed: In iPhone Mirroring, if your app is built with the iOS 27 SDK and sets `UIRequiresFullScreen`, its scene receives continuous resize updates when the user resizes the window. Each resize should instead be delivered as a discrete change to a new `UIScreen` with an updated bounds. (178558224)
- Fixed: In iPhone Mirroring if your app is built with the iOS 27 SDK, its scene is initially connected to a `UIScreen` that isn’t `UIScreen.main`. The scene should start on the main screen. (178558897)
- Fixed: On iPad, if your iPad app is built with the iOS 27 SDK and sets `UIRequiresFullScreen`, the bounds of `UIScreen.main` changes when the user resizes the window. The bounds of the main screen should remain fixed once the screen connects. (178559386)
- Fixed: On iPad, if your iPad app is built with the iOS 27 SDK and sets `UIRequiresFullScreen`, its scene receives continuous resize updates when the user resizes the window. Each resize should instead be delivered as a discrete change to a new `UIScreen` with an updated bounds. (178560235)
- Fixed: On iPad, if your iPhone-only app is built with the iOS 27 SDK its scene continues to honor supported interface orientations after the user resizes the window. After the first resize, the scene should ignore supported interface orientations. (178561952)
- Fixed: On iPad, if your iPhone-only app is built with the iOS 27 SDK and sets `UIRequiresFullScreen`, its scene receives continuous resize updates when the user resizes the window. Each resize should instead be delivered as a discrete change to a new `UIScreen` with an updated bounds. (178562971)
- Fixed: On iPad, if your iPhone-only app is built with the iOS 27 SDK and supports only portrait or only landscape interface orientations, its layout breaks when the iPad is in an orientation the app doesn’t support. (178573319)

<a id="Deprecations"></a>

#### Deprecations

- Apps built with the latest SDK must adopt the scene-based life cycle or they fail to launch. For migration guidance, see [Transitioning to the UIKit scene-based life cycle](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/transitioning-to-the-uikit-scene-based-life-cycle). (141837548)
- `canOpenURL:` is deprecated. Attempt to open the URL and handle any failure instead of validating it first. Using universal links instead of custom URL schemes removes the need for this validation entirely. (179874781)
