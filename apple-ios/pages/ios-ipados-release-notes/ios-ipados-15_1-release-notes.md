## Overview

The iOS & iPadOS 15 SDK provides support to develop apps for iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch devices running iOS & iPadOS 15.1. The SDK comes bundled with Xcode 13, available from the Mac App Store. For information on the compatibility requirements for Xcode 13, see [Xcode 13 Release Notes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-13-release-notes).

### CoreData

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- `NSExpression` immediately forbids certain operations that have significant side effects, like creating and destroying objects. Additionally, casting string class names into Class objects with `NSConstantValueExpression` is deprecated. (84017178)

  **Workaround:** Pass temporary objects to `NSExpression` in the context parameter of [expressionValue(with:context:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsexpression/expressionvalue%28with:context:%29), or with `NSPredicate` as the `substitutionVariables` parameter of [evaluate(with:substitutionVariables:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nspredicate/evaluate%28with:substitutionvariables:%29). You can create a derived predicate with all the substitution variables replaced (bound), using [withSubstitutionVariables(\_:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nspredicate/withsubstitutionvariables%28_:%29) on an existing `NSPredicate` so that code using the object can continue to use a simple `evaluate(with object: Any?)` invocation.
