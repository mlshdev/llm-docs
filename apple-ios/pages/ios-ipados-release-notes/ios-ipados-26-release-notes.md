- Characters for Monogram Avatars in some non-English languages might show up as unexpected symbols.  (154824077)

<a id="CoreData"></a>

### CoreData

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: In beta 5 SDK, CoreData changed several `Sendable` annotations to resolve compatibility issues with Swift 6’s new `MainActor` default isolation feature. These changes include marking `NSManagedObject` as `NS_SWIFT_NONISOLATED NS_SWIFT_NONSENDABLE`, marking `NSManagedObjectContext` as `NS_SWIFT_NONISOLATED NS_SWIFT_SENDABLE`, and requiring `NS_SWIFT_SENDABLE` closures for the family of `perform`, `performBlock`, `performBlockAndWait` and similar methods. These changes are ABI compatible with past releases but might introduce new warnings while building source code that violates the longstanding CoreData concurrency guidelines.

  `NSManagedObject` are mutable reference types inextricably related to others in a graph and cannot be made `Sendable`. They are expected to be isolated to the scope of the `NSManagedObjectContext` that creates or fetches them. `NSManagedObjectContext` is a style of actor which encapsulates its own dispatch queue. While it’s impermissible to use many methods on `NSManagedObjectContext` from other threads, it is permissible to pass references around to invoke the `performBlock` family of methods, for the purpose of routing a `Sendable` closure to its managed dispatch queue. CoreData supports a user default `-com.apple.CoreData.ConcurrencyDebug 1` which can be used to enable additional assertions.  (153848710) (FB18216198)

<a id="Deprecations"></a>

#### Deprecations

- This release removes support for the following deprecated `NSPersistentStore` option keys:

  - `NSPersistentStoreUbiquitousContentNameKey`
  - `NSPersistentStoreUbiquitousContentURLKey`
  - `NSPersistentStoreUbiquitousPeerTokenOption`
  - `NSPersistentStoreRemoveUbiquitousMetadataOption`
  - `NSPersistentStoreUbiquitousContainerIdentifierKey`
  - `NSPersistentStoreRebuildFromUbiquitousContentOption`

  These keys have been deprecated for more than a decade. Affected apps rebuilt with the iOS or macOS 26 SDK will get errors. Apps built against older SDKs will log warnings when opening the store.

  The on-device persistent store will be fully usable after these keys are removed from options dictionary, albeit without syncing. For data syncing, these APIs were superseded by `NSPersistentCloudKitContainer` in iOS 13 and SwiftData in iOS 17. If absolutely necessary, the iCloud content remains accessible in the containers with the last baseline as a .zip archive file.  (157297746) (FB19286235)

<a id="DeclaredAgeRange-API"></a>

### DeclaredAgeRange API

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- If requestAgeRange triggered the onboarding flow for a parent, selecting Always or Never will lead to the API not responding.  (152187255)

  **Workaround:** Try calling requestAgeRange again to get a valid response.
- On iOS, requestAgeRange might incorrectly return notAvailable.  (152194790)

  **Workaround:** Please try signing out and back in with your Apple Account or wait 24 hours.
- On macOS, if onboarding leads to the Ask First state, the user is not prompted to share or not share their age range.  (152327536)

  **Workaround:** Try calling requestAgeRange again to get a valid response.

<a id="Documents"></a>

### Documents

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- EPUB files are shown with an app icon rather than a document icon. Other document types might also be affected. The icon shown is the icon of the app set to open the document. The document opens normally.  (154800649)

<a id="Find-My-App"></a>

### Find My App

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: Play Sound fails when invoked from Share Item Location links, and “Not Reachable” is displayed.  (152029301)

<a id="Foundation"></a>

### Foundation

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- Interpolating non-localized types into a `LocalizedStringResource/String(localized:)/AttributedString(localized:)` value will now display a deprecation warning instead of potentially falling back to a fully-unlocalized string. Provide a localized value to interpolate into the text instead, or silence the warning by wrapping the unlocalized value in a call to `String(describing:)`.  (126876158)
- `ISO8601FormatStyle` now allows fractional seconds, regardless of the setting of `includingFractionalSeconds`. Additionally, `ISO8601FormatStyle` now allows hours-only time zone offsets.  (136950769)

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: Functions that initialize a string from a C-string pointer do not validate that the provided encoding is a valid encoding for C-strings.  (143756086) (FB16417968)

<a id="Foundation-Models-framework"></a>

### Foundation Models framework

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- `LanguageModelSession.prewarm()` now caches the instructions and prefix of your prompt, in addition to loading system resources. The best place to use `prewarm()` is when your app is waiting for user interactions that might trigger response generation. This will reduce the time to the first-generated token.  (152381043)
- `#Playground` in Xcode now allows for filing feedback for Foundation Models framework responses.  (153770707)
- The `.contentTagging` use case now supports non-English languages. You can query the supported languages using `SystemLanguageModel(useCase: .contentTagging).supportedLanguages`. Tags will be generated based on the language of the prompt.  (155801948)
- When you use guided generation, the framework now supports programmatically detecting when and why the model refuses to respond when the content is not unsafe. In previous beta releases, this manifested as a guardrail violation. Now you can catch a specific error case `LanguageModelSession.GenerationError.refusal` and obtain a model-generated explanation for why it refused to respond. Depending on your use case, you might be able to display the explanation in your UI.  (156086748)
- In `GeneratedContent`, you can use the `isComplete` property to check whether the content was fully generated by the model.  (156109416)
- When using guided generation, you can now access the underlying weakly typed `GeneratedContent` by accessing the `rawContent` property on `Response` or `ResponseStream`.  (156351123)
- New guardrails mode `Guardrails.permissiveContentTransformations` allows transformations of content that might otherwise violate the default guardrails. Use this mode for text-to-text tasks, such as summarization and rewrite.  (156721060)

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: When you pass `includeSchemaInPrompt: false` to `respond` or `streamResponse`, it is not respected.  (151926006)
- Fixed: Custom `@Generable` types named `Number` or `Boolean` might not function reliably in guided generation.  (152280144)
- Fixed: Tool calling might not function properly if primitive types such as `Int`, `String`, or `Bool` are used as the argument.  (152318534)
- Fixed: In an Xcode Playground, requests made to the model might receive a “rate limit exceeded” error.  (152325506)
- Fixed: Model requests in macOS command line tools might experience rate limiting.  (152681332)
- Fixed: Generable types with a recursive definition lead to a `SchemaError` when generating a response.  (153147722) (FB17962270)
- Fixed: A prompt containing Chinese might lead to error “Unsupported language zh-hans detected”.  (153151710) (FB17963656)
- Fixed: `Generable` types cannot be made public due to a bug in the `Generable` macro.  (153216183) (FB17990794)
- Fixed: Requests to the model might experience rate limiting, even when the device is connected to power.  (153216632)
- Fixed: The Foundation Models framework cannot be imported when building for Mac Catalyst.  (153255533) (FB18004324)
- Fixed: Creating a `LanguageModelSession` with tools that have duplicate names leads to a fatal error.  (153426645) (FB18074984)
- Fixed: When using guided generation and tool calling together, some requests might lead to `LanguageModelSession.GenerationError.decodingFailure` due to a bug in constrained decoding.  (153773704) (FB18190120)
- Fixed: When creating a session with a transcript, any new tools you attach to the session might not be used. Additionally, if your transcript contains tools from a previous session, those tools must be passed as the `tools:` argument in the new session in order to function properly.  (154904647)
- Fixed: Some prompts erroneously return an error indicating a guardrail violation `(FoundationModels.LanguageModelSession.GenerationError error 2)`.  (155273863)
- Fixed: When using tool calling with guided generation, tools might not get called.  (155313086) (FB18691470)
- Fixed: Generating an enum with associated values through a dynamic schema crashes with a `SchemaError`.  (155957346) (FB18878026)
- Fixed: In some cases, requests you make to the model erroneously throw a `guardrailViolation` for all prompts due to model assets not fully downloaded.  (156223847) (FB18944619)

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- Some instructions and prompts to the model might not lead to expected responses. Use Feedback Assistant to report satisfactory or unsatisfactory cases. When applicable, you can use `LanguageModelSession.logFeedbackAttachment()` to serialize the feedback to a JSON file and attach it to Feedback Assistant.  (152318091)

  **Workaround:** Refine your instructions and prompts using `#Playground` in Xcode. When applying guided generation with a `@Generable` type, add `@Guide` with a custom description on properties to steer the model’s responses.
- If `Argument` type is an enum with associated type, tools will encounter a `ToolCallError` with an underlying `decodingFailure` when the model attempts to call it.  (156723065)

  **Workaround:** Wrap the enum in a struct.

<a id="Game-Center"></a>

### Game Center

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- User cannot start a Challenge for a leaderboard that has not been published Live via App Store Connect.  (151928236)

  **Workaround:** Test leaderboard locally using Game Progress Manager in Xcode, or publish a leaderboard as Live before creating an associated challenge.

<a id="Game-Controller"></a>

### Game Controller

<a id="New-Features"></a>

- Workout session APIs are now available on iOS and iPadOS. This includes `HKWorkoutSession` and `HKLiveWorkoutBuilder`, which can be used in your app to track workouts.  (125746390)

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: An app that was granted Read-only authorization for certain data types (e.g. workout routes) might lose its ability to read the data type without the user explicitly turning it off in Settings \> Health.  (149024236)
- Fixed: The authorization screen prompted by the Medications Authorization API cannot be dismissed if the user has no available medications needing authorization.  (152094574)

- Fixed: Transaction or Promotion messages filtered by a Message Filter App Extension might be badged as “Unknown” in the conversation list rather than “Transaction” or “Promotion”.  (151869409)
- Fixed: Generative backgrounds do not work with Japanese keyboard.  (155186919)

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- Users on older devices won’t see compatibility messages for polls, so they might be unaware a poll was sent.  (148545742)
- Expanding Conversation Details causes the list of conversations to collapse.  (149436051)

  **Workaround:** Closing Conversation Details will bring back the list.
- Deleting and reporting as spam a message that was filtered by a Message Filter App extension does not send the spam report to the extension.  (150832702)
- Devices with “Filter Unknown Senders” on before update might have “Time Sensitive” on by default under the Allow Notifications setting in the Unknown Senders section of Messages Settings.  (150856051)

  **Workaround:** Enable “Time Sensitive” manually.
- Messages fail to translate when only the recipient has translation enabled.   (157779997)

  **Workaround:** Both participants in the conversation must enable translation.

This specifically targets data that enters the Unified Logging System via `NSLog`, and will not impact the Xcode console or `NSLog`’s `stdout` output. If you wish to log un-redacted data to the Unified Logging System please use the “os_log” or “Logger” interfaces.  (137129180)

<a id="Object-Capture"></a>

### Object Capture

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- A new algorithm significantly improves `PhotogrammetrySession` reconstruction quality of low-texture objects not captured with the `ObjectCaptureSession` front end. It will be downloaded and cached once in the background when the `PhotogrammetrySession` is used at runtime. If network isn’t available at that time, the old low quality model will be used until the new one can be downloaded. There is no code change needed to get this improved model.  (145220451)

<a id="SwiftUI"></a>

### SwiftUI

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- `ControlSize` now conforms to `Comparable`, and `View/controlSize(_:)` can now be used to clamp the environment’s `controlSize` to a given range.  (99633360) (FB11465757)
- In apps built with the macOS 26 SDK, `Section` footers within a `Form` of the `GroupedFormStyle` now have leading alignment, default font, and foreground styles. Use the `sectionActions(content:)` view modifier on your `Section` to supply section actions, which maintain a trailing placement in macOS. In iOS and iPadOS, each section action displays as its own form row.  (129868475)
- Text, TextEditor, and TextField now by default use string contents to determine the appropriate base writing direction for each paragraph, instead of relying on layout directionality. To specify the writing direction explicitly on a per-paragraph basis, use Foundation’s `AttributedString.writingDirection` attribute. To make the base writing direction follow the layout direction for an entire view, apply the view modifier `.writingDirection(strategy: .layoutBased)`.  (134821288)
- In apps built with the macOS 26 and iOS 26 SDKs, a `Picker` view of a style that produces a button-like control now has a fitted sizing behavior by default. If needed, use the `buttonSizing(_:)` view modifier to make the `Picker` flexible and fill the available width of its container.  (136649748)
- When linking news SDKs, `NavigationLink`s produce a single view, rather than a list of views in view list contexts. This change improves performance of many `NavigationLink`s in lazy containers like `List`. However, if you are relying on `ContainerValues` propagating out of the `label` view of a `NavigationLink`, or similarly relying on `ContainerValues` of a `ButtonStyle` used to style a link, the `containerValue(_:,_:)` modifier should be moved outside of the link. Below is a minimal example that demonstrates the behavior difference:

  ```swift
   import SwiftUI
   
   struct ContentView: View {
       @State private var presentPopover = false
       var body: some View {
           NavigationLink("Custom Link", value: 84)
               .buttonStyle(MyButtonStyle(containerValue: "Eighty-four"))
       }
   }
   
   struct ParentView: View {
       var body: some View {
           Group(subviews: ContentView()) { subviews in
               ForEach(subviews) { subview in
                   Text(subview.containerValues.myCustomValue)
               }
           }
           .frame(minWidth: 100, minHeight: 100)
       }
   }
   
   struct MyButtonStyle: PrimitiveButtonStyle {
       var containerValue: String
       func makeBody(configuration: Configuration) -> some View {
           Button(configuration)
               .buttonBorderShape(.circle)
               .containerValue(\.myCustomValue, containerValue)
       }
   }
   
   private struct MyContainerValueKey: ContainerValueKey {
       static let defaultValue: String = "Default value"
   }
   
   extension ContainerValues {
       var myCustomValue: String {
           get { self[MyContainerValueKey.self] }
           set { self[MyContainerValueKey.self] = newValue }
       }
   }
   
   #Preview {
       ParentView()
   }
  ```

  (140283584)
- `List` no longer ignores the vertical insets of rows with a height close to the default minimum height on iOS and visionOS. Use `listRowInsets(_:_:)` to change the vertical row insets.  (141160852)
- In `NavigationSplitView` and `TabView`s configured as `sidebarAdaptable`, the view trailing the sidebar’s safe area is inset in the width of the sidebar. It can display content outside its safe area, underneath the sidebar.  (141222137)
- On macOS, after linking new SDKs, the style of search fields with `SearchFieldPlacement.sidebar` is now fixed to the toolbar. Previously the search field would scroll as the first element in the list.  (143546967)
- In iOS and iPadOS apps that adopt the new design, a picker of `.segmented` style now supports `.large` and `.extraLarge` control sizes.  (144417732)
- In apps that adopt the new design, the `buttonBorderShape(_:)` view modifier can be used to customize the shape of bordered buttons. Previously this modifier only affected buttons in Widgets in macOS.  (145773436)
- The `buttonSizing(_:)` view modifier specifies the sizing behavior of `Button`, `Picker`, `Menu`, and other button-producing controls. If you are using `Spacer` views or an infinite-width frame in your `Button` label to create a flexible button, apply `buttonSizing(.flexible)` to the `Button` instead.  (146327046)
- On iPadOS, sidebars and inspector titles now default to inline in the regular size class. You can use `navigationTitleDisplayMode(:_)` to specify a different title display mode.  (150891824)
- On iPadOS, navigation link chevrons are not visible by default in the content column of `NavigationSplitViews ` in the regular size class. You can use `navigationLinkIndicatorVisibility(:_)` to specify a different indicator visibility.  (151646790)

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: `TextEditor`’s undo stack might contain invalid operations for applications with multiple `TextEditor` views.  (83650197) (FB9662463)
- Fixed: The menu content of some `Menu` views does not update as the result of a state change.  (106878937)
- Fixed: [View.onHover(perform:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/onhover%28perform:%29) and [View.onContinuousHover(coordinateSpace:perform:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/oncontinuoushover%28coordinatespace:perform:%29) affect hit-testing for gestures. Gestures are not received if one of these view modifiers is used within an overlay.  (108560020)
- Fixed: Section views without `isExpanded` binding are collapsible in a sidebar-styled List on macOS.  (115797465) (FB13192271)
- Fixed: `listSectionSpacing` does not work correctly for sections that have headers and footers. For more control over the list section layout, use the `listSectionMargins` modifier.  (140929163)
- Fixed: On iOS, `navigationSplitViewColumnWidth()` does not respect the specified minimum and maximum column widths.  (143529326)
- Fixed: Multiple title views in sidebar list labels on iOS are not styled hierarchically as title and subtitle.  (144253754)
- Fixed: In custom layouts that do not implement `explicitAlignment(of:in:proposal:subviews:cache:)`, alignment guides do not work correctly for a right-to-left layout direction.  (145073832)
- Fixed: Applying a `bold` modifier to `Text` resets the `weight` configuration. The interaction of `bold` and `weight` is not consistent between Text and Font.  (147270079)
- Fixed: Environment updates from outside of a popover might fail to propagate into the popover’s content view.  (147954025)
- Fixed: Gestures added using the [simultaneousGesture(\_:isEnabled:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/simultaneousgesture%28_:isenabled:%29) view modifier are incorrectly simultaneous with ancestor gestures.  (147970990)
- Fixed: On platforms supporting edge-attached and non-edge-attached sheets, non-edge-attached sheets present erroneously as full-screen covers when `.navigationTransition(.zoom...)` is specified. If you wish to keep the full-screen cover in compact size classes, configure a sheet with:

  ```swift
   .sheet(...) {
      ContentView()
       .navigationTransition(.zoom...)
       .presentationSizing(.page)
       .presentationCompactAdaptation(.fullScreen)
  ```

  (150455117)
- Fixed: On iOS and iPadOS, sheets applied to toolbar items sometimes do not display if the sheet is presented at the same time a popover is dismissed.  (150764801)
- Fixed: On iOS and iPadOS, toolbar items in the navigation bar may become non-centered after a state change.  (152168945)
- Fixed: If Default Actor Isolation is set to `MainActor`, `@Animatable` macro emits concurrency warnings in Swift 5 language mode and does not compile in Swift 6 language mode.  (152524435)
- Fixed: On iOS and iPadOS, `.fullScreenCover` backgrounds are transparent when they should be opaque.  (154232311)
- Fixed: Gestures do not have the same lower priority over the view’s existing `UIGestureRecognizer`s and `NSGestureRecognizer`s as they do over the view’s existing SwiftUI gestures.

  In apps built with iOS 26, macOS 26, tvOS 26, and visionOS 26, use [highPriorityGesture(\_:isEnabled:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/highprioritygesture%28_:isenabled:%29) to make sure your gesture takes precedence over the view’s existing gestures, or use [`simultaneousGesture(_:isEnabled:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/simultaneousgesture%28_:isenabled:%29) to give your gesture the same priority as the view’s existing gestures.  (155581361)
- Fixed: On iOS, iPadOS, and Mac Catalyst, popovers that access environment objects declared outside of a popover’s content view might crash when `isPresented = true`.   (156906038)

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- On iOS and iPadOS, inspector does not respect the width applied with `inspectorColumnWidth`.  (145162377)
- `toolbarForegroundStyle` no longer tints toolbar button labels on watchOS.  (151487439)

  **Workaround:** Tint the button label directly, using `Text("foo").foregroundStyle(...)`.
- On iOS and iPadOS, bordered prominent buttons in toolbars do not have the correct default padding or symbol metrics.  (151792861)
- `.toolbarVisibility(_:for:)` does not hide the navigation bar on watchOS.  (152326250)

<a id="Deprecations"></a>

#### Deprecations

- `Text` concatenation using the `+` operator is deprecated because it makes it hard to create localized strings that are correct across all languages. Use `Text` interpolation instead. See documentation on `Text` for more info on how to produce localized strings.  (128144043)
- On iOS and iPadOS, inspector columns do not present if the hierarchy does not contain a `NavigationSplitView`. (145686228)
- When you re-compile against iOS 26 and iPadOS 26, `inspector` now requires navigation in order to display toolbar items in some cases. If your app is affected, add a `NavigationStack` to your inspector content view.  (145686228)

<a id="TextKit"></a>

### TextKit

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- iOS 26, tvOS 26, visionOS 26, watchOS 26, and macOS Tahoe 26 have two methods for resolving the natural alignment `NSTextAlignment.natural` and the last line of `NSTextAlignment.justified` into concrete alignments, `left` and `right`. The first approach utilizes the UI language, which is determined by passing nil-language to `NSParagraphStyle.defaultWritingDirection(forLanguage: )`. This behavior was employed prior to this release. The second method is new and dynamically utilizes the base writing direction for the paragraph. When the base writing direction is set to `NSWritingDirection.rightToLeft`, the text is aligned to `right`, and vice versa. The behavior is selected by API introduced in this major release: `NSTextLayoutManager.resolvesNaturalAlignmentWithBaseWritingDirection`, `NSStringDrawingOptionsResolvesNaturalAlignmentWithBaseWritingDirection`, `UITraitCollection.resolvesNaturalAlignmentWithBaseWritingDirection`, and `NSTextField.resolvesNaturalAlignmentWithBaseWritingDirection`.  (152045248)

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: The directionality of `NSParagraphStyle` indentation properties (`firstLineHeadIndent`, `headIndent`, and `tailIndent`) is determined by inconsistent hidden rules implemented by the TextKit typesetting engine.

  With iOS 26, macOS 26, tvOS 26, watchOS 26, and visionOS 26, the TextKit 2 typesetting engine has been standardized to utilize the resolved writing direction for the paragraph when linked with the OS 26 versions of the corresponding SDKs. For binary compatibility, applications developed with prior SDK versions will use the UI language in a subset of API interfaces. Specifically, for `UILabel`, `NSTextField`, `SwiftUI.Text`, and `NSStringDrawing`, the indentation directionality is determined by the UI language queried by passing nil to `NSParagraphStyle. defaultWritingDirection()` in applications built with prior SDK versions.  (155893102)

<a id="TextKit-2"></a>

### TextKit 2

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- A new property, `includesTextListMarkers`, is introduced to `NSTextList`, `NSTextContentStorage`, and `NSWritingToolsCoordinator`. This property controls whether to include the text list marker string in the contents of `NSAttributedString` for paragraphs associated with `NSTextList`. TextKit 1 expects the marker string, while TextKit 2 does not. The TextKit 2 behavior was adopted by UIKit starting with iOS 18 (`includesTextListMarkers=NO`). AppKit is also adopting the TextKit 2 text list behavior starting with macOS 26.  (128479184)

- In apps using `UIToolbar`, the Search bar sometimes does not respond to taps and displays without the magnifying glass, dictation button, or placeholder text.  (151126350)

  **Workaround:** Quit the app then re-launch it.
- On iPhone only, the `searchTextField` property of a `UISearchBar` belonging to a `UISearchController` (i.e. `searchController.searchBar.searchTextField`) might not return the same instance when called at different times.   (153550157)

  **Workaround:** Look for `UISearchBar` or `UISearchController` API equivalent to the `UISearchTextField` API you’re using. If none can be found, you can prevent the issue by setting the `UINavigationItem.searchBarPlacementAllowsToolbarIntegration` property to `false` on the navigation item the search controller has been assigned to.
- In rare cases after launching an app on iPhone, unusual client code timing of assembling the view controller hierarchy might cause the search bar belonging to a view controller in a tab to disappear from the navigation bar when first switching to that tab.  (156174227)

  **Workaround:** Set the `searchBarPlacementAllowsToolbarIntegration` property of the UINavigationItem to `false` at the same time you set the `searchController`.
- In rare cases, the layout calculation from a client’s layout constraint for their search results might change when presenting a `UISearchController` directly (for example, using `-presentViewController:`) after building with the new SDK. This is due to removal of internal constraints with the identifier `UIView-Encapsulated-Layout-Width` and `UIView-Encapsulated-Layout-Height`.  (157208725)

  **Workaround:** Examine the existing constraints and determine how to modify them to be stable independent of the presence of the encapsulation constraints. Compare the results of `po [<view> _autoLayoutTrace]` with an older SDK and look for views marked with a bullet. If they don’t have a bullet on the new SDK, their encapsulation constraints will have been removed. This will get you started on adjusting your constraints setup.
