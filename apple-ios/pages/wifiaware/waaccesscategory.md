# WAAccessCategory

**Framework:** Wi-Fi Aware  
**Kind:** Enumeration  
**Availability:** iOS 26.0+ · iPadOS 26.0+ · Mac Catalyst 26.0+

The underling quality-of-service (QoS) the Wi-Fi layer uses to transmit data packets from a connection over the air.

## Declaration

```swift
enum WAAccessCategory
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

A given `NetworkConnection` is bound to a single access category at the Wi-Fi layer, based on the configuration of `NWParameter`’s  `serviceClass` property. This allows your app to specify how the Wi-Fi layer transmits the `NetworkConnection`’s data packets, selecting the performance characteristics that are relevant to the data flow.

Wi-Fi is a shared medium, so all Wi-Fi devices, networks, apps, and  `NetworkConnection`s share the overall Wi-Fi capacity between them. An app can improve the performance of its data flows, and that of all other nearby devices and Wi-Fi networks, by choosing the lowest QoS category that meets the requirements of each of its flows. When in doubt, use the default `.bestEffort` category.

For more information, refer to [NWParameters.ServiceClass](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/network/nwparameters/serviceclass-swift.enum) and [NWParameters](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/network/nwparameters).

Access categories are typically created by the system on behalf of the client, so they usually don’t need to be instantiated directly.

## Topics

### Providing throughput

- [WAAccessCategory.bestEffort](waaccesscategory/besteffort.md): A default quality-of-service (QoS) type that provides high throughput for data transfers of any size.
- [WAAccessCategory.background](waaccesscategory/background.md): A quality-of-service (QoS) type that provides high throughput for delay-tolerant, noninteractive data transfers of any size.
- [WAAccessCategory.interactiveVideo](waaccesscategory/interactivevideo.md): A quality-of-service (QoS) type that provides low-latency for moderate throughput flows.
- [WAAccessCategory.interactiveVoice](waaccesscategory/interactivevoice.md): A quality-of-service (QoS) type that provides very low-latency for low-throughput flows.
