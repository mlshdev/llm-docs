# allDevices(matching:)

**Framework:** Wi-Fi Aware  
**Kind:** Type Method  
**Availability:** iOS 26.0+ · iPadOS 26.0+ · Mac Catalyst 26.0+

Provides a snapshot of all the paired devices known to your app.

## Declaration

```swift
static func allDevices(matching: Predicate<WAPairedDevice>) -> WAPairedDevice.DevicesSequence
```

## Parameters

- `matching`: The predicate that filters the devices. The system only provides updates for devices matching this predicate.

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

A new [WAPairedDevice.DevicesSequence](devicessequence.md) that returns [WAPairedDevice.Devices](devices.md) elements holding a snapshot of the currently paired devices known to your app.

<a id="discussion"></a>

## Discussion

This method gets an `AsyncSequence` that provides snapshots of all [WAPairedDevice.Devices](devices.md) currently paired and known to your app that match the provided predicate, and provides updates when the snapshot of [WAPairedDevice.Devices](devices.md) matching that predicate changes. The sequence outputs an empty dictionary if there are no paired devices matching the predicate that are known to your app, or if a person removes all of your app’s matching paired devices.

You can select the set of `Devices` matching a filter from this property using the code below:

```swift
let filter = #Predicate<WAPairedDevice> { $0.pairingInfo?.vendorName.starts(with: "Example Inc") ?? false }

// Get a snapshot of all paired devices at the current moment.
guard let devices = try await WAPairedDevice.allDevices(matching:filter).current() { return }

// Get a snapshot of all paired devices at the current moment, and get a new snapshot each time a device is added, changed, or removed.
for try await devices in WAPairedDevice.allDevices(matching:filter) {
	// Process update.
}
```
