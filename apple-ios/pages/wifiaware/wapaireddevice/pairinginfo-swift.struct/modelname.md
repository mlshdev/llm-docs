## Discussion

The system receives this data from the device within an DNS-SD TXT record. The value set in the `modelName` property is the  value that follows the DNS-SD TXT record key:

```
modelName=
```

The system interprets the value as an \<= 63-byte UTF-8 string and may truncate it if it’s longer than 63 bytes. Refer to [RFC 6763](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6763#section-6.3) for more information on the over-the-air encoding
