# WAPairedDevice.DevicesSequence

**Framework:** Wi-Fi Aware  
**Kind:** Structure  
**Availability:** iOS 26.0+ · iPadOS 26.0+ · Mac Catalyst 26.0+

A sequence that vends updates to a paired device list, as the list changes.

## Declaration

```swift
struct DevicesSequence
```

## Overview

The `DevicesSequence` produces an asynchronous sequence of [WAPairedDevice.Devices](devices.md) items, providing the latest snapshot of the paired devices known to your app.

## Topics

### Getting an initial snapshot

- [current()](devicessequence/current%28%29.md): Fetches a one-time snapshot of all paired devices that are currently known and accessible to your app.

### Getting async updates

- [WAPairedDevice.DevicesSequence.AsyncIterator](devicessequence/asynciterator.md): An iterator for the sequence of devices.
- [makeAsyncIterator()](devicessequence/makeasynciterator%28%29.md): Makes an asynchronous iterator that provides successive device snapshots when the list of paired devices known to the app changes.
- [WAPairedDevice.DevicesSequence.Element](devicessequence/element.md): A dictionary holding a snapshot of currently paired devices accessible to your app.
