## Discussion

Call this function when your extension has successfully launched or connected to an application on the remote device and is ready to begin media playback. This indicates that the session has been established and the remote application is prepared to receive media content or playback commands.

This function should be called after the following conditions are met:

- The connection to the remote device has been established
- The remote application has been launched or awakened
- The playback interface is ready to accept commands
- Any necessary authentication or session initialization has completed

After calling this function, the system will be able to route media playback to the device and provide playback controls through the `playbackControl` interface.

> **Important**

> Call this function on the main actor to ensure thread-safe state updates.
