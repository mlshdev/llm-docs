# recipients

**Framework:** TelephonyMessagingKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 26.0+

The recipients of the MMS message, as an array of MMS handles.

## Declaration

```swift
var recipients: [MMSHandle]
```

<a id="discussion"></a>

## Discussion

When this array contains any elements, it may imply that the corresponding message is a group MMS. To determine if the message is a group MMS, inspect the value of the [from](from.md) property for multiple distinct handles. For example, if `recipients == [A]` and `from == B`, then the MMS uses a group consisting of `A`, `B`, and the person using the app.
