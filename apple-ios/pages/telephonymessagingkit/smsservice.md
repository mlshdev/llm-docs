# SMSService

**Framework:** TelephonyMessagingKit  
**Kind:** Class  
**Availability:** iOS 26.0+

A class that provides an interface for performing SMS operations.

## Declaration

```swift
final class SMSService
```

## Mentioned In

## Overview

Use the [TelephonyMessagingSession](telephonymessagingsession.md) property [smsService](telephonymessagingsession/smsservice.md) to get an instance of this class. You can then monitor the [incomingMessageNotifications](smsservice/incomingmessagenotifications.md) asynchronous sequence to receive notifications of incoming messages, and the [sendMessage(\_:)](smsservice/sendmessage%28__%29.md) method to send outgoing messages.

The following example shows how to send an SMS message with the first service found in the session’s [cellularServices](telephonymessagingsession/cellularservices.md) array.

```swift
import TelephonyMessagingKit

let service = TelephonyMessagingSession.shared.smsService

let cellularServices = try session.cellularServices
let cellularServiceID = cellularServices[0].id

guard service.isViable(for: cellularServiceID) else { return }

let message = SMSMessage(
    cellularServiceID: cellularServiceID,
    handle: SMSHandle(phoneNumber: SAMPLE_PHONE_NUMBER),
    messageID: SMSMessageID(rawValue: SAMPLE_MESSAGE_ID),
    content: SMSContent(body: "Hello there.")
)

try await service.sendMessage(message)
```

To receive messages, iterate over the [incomingMessageNotifications](smsservice/incomingmessagenotifications.md) asynchronous sequence, and retrieve messages from each notification as it arrives, as shown below:

```swift
import TelephonyMessagingKit

let service = TelephonyMessagingSession.shared.smsService

let incomingMessageNotifications = try service.incomingMessageNotifications
Task {
    for await notification in incomingMessageNotifications {
        let receivedMessage = notification.message
        // Process receivedMessage.
    }
}
```

## Topics

### Determining service viabililty

- [isViable(for:)](smsservice/isviable%28for_%29.md): Queries whether the device can perform SMS operations at this time.
- [viabilityNotifications](smsservice/viabilitynotifications.md): An asynchronous sequence of service viability notifications produced by this service.
- [SMSService.ViabilityNotification](smsservice/viabilitynotification.md): A notification that indicates whether SMS is viable for a given cellular service.

### Sending messages

- [sendMessage(\_:)](smsservice/sendmessage%28__%29.md): Sends an SMS message to the given destination.
- [SMSMessage](smsmessage.md): A structure that contains the data of an SMS message.

### Receiving messages

- [incomingMessageNotifications](smsservice/incomingmessagenotifications.md): An asynchronous sequence of incoming message notifications produced by this service.
- [SMSService.IncomingMessageNotification](smsservice/incomingmessagenotification.md): A structure that contains information about an incoming SMS message.

### Handling critical state changes

- [criticalMessageStateNotifications](smsservice/criticalmessagestatenotifications.md): An asynchronous sequence of critical message state notifications.
- [SMSService.CriticalMessageStateNotification](smsservice/criticalmessagestatenotification.md): A structure that contains information about a critical SMS message.

### Reporting spam

- [reportSpam(\_:)](smsservice/reportspam%28__%29.md): Reports an SMS message as spam to the carrier and to partners.

### Handling errors

- [SMSService.Error](smsservice/error.md): A type to define errors that can occur when performing SMS operations.
