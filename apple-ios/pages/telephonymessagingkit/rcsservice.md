# RCSService

**Framework:** TelephonyMessagingKit  
**Kind:** Class  
**Availability:** iOS 26.0+

A class that provides an interface for performing RCS operations.

```swift
final class RCSService
```

## Overview

Use the [TelephonyMessagingSession](telephonymessagingsession.md) property [rcsService](telephonymessagingsession/rcsservice.md) to get an instance of this class.

An `RCSService` sends and receives different kinds of messages, distinguished by the [content](rcsmessage/content-swift.property.md) property of [RCSMessage](rcsmessage.md):

- **[RCSMessage.Text](rcsmessage/text.md)**: Plain text.
- **[RCSMessage.FileTransfer](rcsmessage/filetransfer.md)**: Incoming or outgoing file transfer. To send a file to a receipient, call the [upload(\_:)](rcsservice/upload%28__%29.md): method, then send a message of this type. To receive a file, handle the incoming message from the [incomingMessageNotifications](rcsservice/incomingmessagenotifications.md) asynchronous sequence, and use its metadata to call [download(\_:)](rcsservice/download%28__%29.md).
- **[RCSMessage.GeolocationPush](rcsmessage/geolocationpush.md)**: The sender’s location, as indicated by a latitude and longitude pair.
- **[RCSMessage.ComposingIndicator](rcsmessage/composingindicator.md)**: An indicator that the sender is currently composing a message. Use this content type to provide “is typing” indicators to recipients.
- **[RCSMessage.DispositionNotification](rcsmessage/dispositionnotification.md)**: An update regarding the processing of a message by the recipient app. This includes things like whether delivery suceeded or failed, and whether the app displayed the message to the recipient.

Use the various overloads of `sendMessage(_:to:using:messageID)` to send messages of these types to recipients. The following example shows how to send a plain text message with [sendMessage(\_:to:using:messageID:)](rcsservice/sendmessage%28__to_using_messageid_%29-70q7h.md):

```swift
let service = TelephonyMessagingSession.shared.rcsService

let cellularServices = try TelephonyMessagingSession.shared.cellularServices
let cellularServiceID = cellularServices[0].id

guard service.isViable(for: cellularServiceID) else { return }

let message = RCSMessage.Text("Hello there.")
guard let handle = RCSHandle.phoneNumber(SAMPLE_PHONE_NUMBER) else { return }
try await service.sendMessage(message,
                   to: handle,
                   using:cellularServiceID,
                   messageID: RCSMessageID(rawValue: SAMPLE_RCS_MESSAGE_ID))
```

To receive messages, iterate over the [incomingMessageNotifications](rcsservice/incomingmessagenotifications.md) asynchronous sequence with a `for`-`await`-`in` loop, then handle each notification based on its message content type, like this:

```swift
let service = TelephonyMessagingSession.shared.rcsService

let incomingMessageNotifications = try service.incomingMessageNotifications
Task {
    for await notification in incomingMessageNotifications {
        let receivedMessage = notification.message
        switch receivedMessage.content {
            case .text(let text): // ...
            case .fileTransfer(let fileTransfer): // ...
            case .geolocationPush(let geolocationPush): // ...
            case .dispositionNotification(let dispositionNotification): // ...
            case .composingIndicator(let composingIndicator): // ...
        }
    }
}
```
