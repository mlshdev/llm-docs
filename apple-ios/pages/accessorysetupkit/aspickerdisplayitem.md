## Declaration

```swift
class ASPickerDisplayItem
```

## Mentioned In

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Create instances of `ASPickerDisplayItem` that describe the accessories you want to discover. Each item contains a name and product image to display, plus an [ASDiscoveryDescriptor](asdiscoverydescriptor.md) that identifies the kind of accessories to match. Pass these in an array to [showPicker(for:completionHandler:)](asaccessorysession/showpicker%28for_completionhandler_%29.md) to display a picker that allows the person using your app to discover and select nearby accessories.

Filter the matched accessories by supplying a [descriptor](aspickerdisplayitem/descriptor.md), which contains various Bluetooth and Wi-Fi properties to match. The descriptor also allows you to set the [bluetoothRange](asdiscoverydescriptor/bluetoothrange.md) of matched accessories; set its value to [ASDiscoveryDescriptor.Range.immediate](asdiscoverydescriptor/range/immediate.md) to limit discovery of Bluetooth accessories to those within the immediate proximity of the device running your app.

To enable different behaviors during setup, use the [setupOptions](aspickerdisplayitem/setupoptions-swift.property.md) property, which is an option set (Swift) or bitfield (Objective-C) of behavior options. The defined options in [ASPickerDisplayItem.SetupOptions](aspickerdisplayitem/setupoptions-swift.struct.md) allow you to specify behaviors like allowing renaming of the accessory during setup, or confirming accessory authorization before showing the setup view.
