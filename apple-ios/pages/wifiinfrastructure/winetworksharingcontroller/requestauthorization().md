## Discussion

Call this method to request that the system ask the person to authorize sharing of Wi-Fi networks to the specified accessory. The person or the system may decline the request.

The person can select from the following sharing modes:

- **Automatically Share**: The system automatically sends new networks to the accessory when the device joins them while the accessory is connected.
- **Ask Every Time**: When the device joins a new network, the system notifies your extension through the Wi-Fi Infrastructure framework. Your extension can then check [newShareableNetworkAvailable](../winetworksharingprovider/networkevent/newshareablenetworkavailable.md) and call [presentAskToShareUI(scanProvider:)](../winetworksharingprovider/presentasktoshareui%28scanprovider_%29.md) to present UI asking the person to share that network.
- **Don’t Share**: The person declines to share Wi-Fi networks with this accessory.

In the “Automatically Share” and “Ask Every Time” sharing modes, the accessory may request to share a nearby network that’s known to the person. Accessories can use this to prompt a person to share a different network if they have trouble connecting to a previously shared network.

> **Throws**

> - `accessoryTransportNotSecured` if the accessory is not using a secure Bluetooth transport.
> - `accessoryNotConnected` if the accessory isn’t connected when your container app calls this method.
> - `WINetworkSharingError` if other faults occur.
