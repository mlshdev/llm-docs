# AccessoryDataProvider

**Framework:** Accessory Transport Extension  
**Kind:** Protocol  
**Availability:** iOS 26.5+

A protocol for an extension that receives iOS system notifications and curates their data for your accessory.

## Declaration

```swift
protocol AccessoryDataProvider : AppExtension, Sendable where Self.Configuration : AccessoryDataProviderConfiguration
```

## Mentioned In

- [Receiving iOS notifications on an accessory](receiving-ios-notifications-on-an-accessory.md)
- [Forwarding notifications to your accessory using the internet transport type](forwarding-notifications-to-your-accessory-using-the-internet-transport-type.md)

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Implement this protocol in an extension with an `EXExtensionPointIdentifier` value of `com.apple.accessory-data-provider` to receive notification data for eventual forwarding to an accessory that you develop. The extension runs in a sandboxed environment and communicates with the system through the extension’s configuration object ([AccessoryDataProviderConfiguration](accessorydataproviderconfiguration.md)).

> **Important**

> The system requires your app extension to have the [com.apple.developer.accessory-data-provider](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com.apple.developer.accessory-data-provider) entitlement to use this protocol.

## Add the necessary target configuration

In your extension’s target properties, include the `EXCapabilities` key with the value `AccessoryNotifications.NotificationsForwarding`:

```xml
<plist>
    <dict>
        <key>EXAppExtensionAttributes</key>
        <dict>
            <key>EXExtensionPointIdentifier</key>
            <string>com.apple.accessory-data-provider</string>
            <key>EXCapabilities</key>
            <array>
                <string>AccessoryNotifications.NotificationsForwarding</string>
            </array>
        </dict>
    </dict>
</plist>
```

<a id="Implement-the-extension-point"></a>

## Implement the extension point

In your extension’s Swift code, implement the protocol and declare the capability with your [NotificationsForwarding.AccessoryNotificationsHandler](../accessorynotifications/notificationsforwarding/accessorynotificationshandler.md) implementation:

```swift
struct DataProvider: AccessoryDataProvider {
    var extensionPoint: AppExtensionPoint {
        Identifier("com.apple.accessory-data-provider")
        Implementing {
            NotificationsForwarding {
                MyNotificationsHandler()
            }
        }
    }
}

class MyNotificationsHandler: AccessoryNotificationsHandler {
    // Your extension's implementation.
}
```

<a id="Share-data-between-the-app-and-the-extension"></a>

## Share data between the app and the extension

Configure a shared app group so your companion app can provide information to the extension. The extension has read-only access to the shared container. Use the shared container to store:

- Authentication tokens for your private servers
- Accessory-specific preferences (max payload size, content filtering)
- Device-specific configuration

```swift
// In the companion app, write to the shared container.
let sharedDefaults = UserDefaults(suiteName: "group.com.yourcompany.accessoryapp")
sharedDefaults?.set(authToken, forKey: "ServerAuthToken")

// In the extension, read from the shared container.
let sharedDefaults = UserDefaults(suiteName: "group.com.yourcompany.accessoryapp")
let authToken = sharedDefaults?.string(forKey: "ServerAuthToken")
```
