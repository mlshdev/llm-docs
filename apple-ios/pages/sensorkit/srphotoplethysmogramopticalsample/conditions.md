# conditions (Swift)

**Framework:** SensorKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 17.4+ · iPadOS 17.4+ · Mac Catalyst 17.4+

The sensor context or conditions that may affect the sample.

## Declaration

```swift
var conditions: [SRPhotoplethysmogramOpticalSample.Condition] { get }
```

## Discussion

Use these flags to determine whether the data is valid or other system conditions occur during the recording that impact the data.
