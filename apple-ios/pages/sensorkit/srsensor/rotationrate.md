## Discussion

The [sample](../srfetchresult/sample.md) type for this sensor is \[[CMRecordedRotationRateData](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremotion/cmrecordedrotationratedata)\].

You need to provide a reason to record rotation rate data by adding the [SRSensorUsageMotion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information-property-list/nssensorkitusagedetail/srsensorusagemotion) dictionary to the [NSSensorKitUsageDetail](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information-property-list/nssensorkitusagedetail) key in the information property list.
