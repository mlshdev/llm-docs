# NFCPresentmentIntentAssertion

**Framework:** Core NFC  
**Kind:** Class  
**Availability:** iOS 17.4+ · iPadOS 17.4+

An object that signals your app’s intention to make exclusive use of the device’s contactless features.

## Declaration

```swift
final class NFCPresentmentIntentAssertion
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Acquire an instance of this class to prevent the system default contactless app from launching in response to a user gesture or NFC reader RF field. You do this when the person using your app expresses an active intent to perform an NFC transaction, like choosing a credential such as a payment card or transit pass. You can only acquire a [NFCPresentmentIntentAssertion](nfcpresentmentintentassertion.md) when your app is in the foreground state.

> **Note**

> A presentment intent assertion isn’t required before launching the presentment sheet.

The presentment intent assertion expires if any of the following occur:

- The presentment intent assertion object deinitializes.
- Your app goes into the background.
- 15 seconds elapse.

After the presentment intent assertion expires, you must wait through a 15-second cool-down period before you can acquire a new instance.
