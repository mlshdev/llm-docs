# NFCWindowSceneEvent

**Framework:** CoreNFC  
**Kind:** Enumeration  
**Availability:** iOS 17.4+ · iPadOS 17.4+ · Mac Catalyst 17.4+

An NFC-related event that your app uses to update its user interface.

## Declaration

```swift
enum NFCWindowSceneEvent
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

When the device is eligible to receive NFC-related events, this type indicates the type of received event. The event may indicate the presence of an NFC reader or a gesture by the person using the app to initiate a contactless transaction. [NFCWindowSceneEvent](nfcwindowsceneevent.md) represents these as the [NFCWindowSceneEvent.readerDetected](nfcwindowsceneevent/readerdetected.md) and [NFCWindowSceneEvent.presentation](nfcwindowsceneevent/presentation.md) cases, respectively.

You can receive this event in two scenarios:

- When the system calls [UISceneDelegate](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiscenedelegate) method [scene(\_:willConnectTo:options:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiscenedelegate/scene%28_:willconnectto:options:%29), the system created a new scene in response to the event. In this case, check the `connectionOptions` parameter for the presence of the [nfcEvent](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiscene/connectionoptions/nfcevent) member, which is an instance of [NFCWindowSceneEvent](nfcwindowsceneevent.md).
- When the system calls the [NFCWindowSceneDelegate](nfcwindowscenedelegate.md) method [windowScene(\_:didReceiveNFCWindowSceneEvent:)](nfcwindowscenedelegate/windowscene%28__didreceivenfcwindowsceneevent_%29.md), the system delivered the event to an existing scene.

In either case, store the event and use it to update the UI for an NFC interaction. The following example shows a scene delegate that handles both scenarios, using a `ViewModel` class to store the event for use by an appropriate view:

```swift
import UIKit
import SwiftUI
import CoreNFC

class SceneDelegate: UIResponder, UIWindowSceneDelegate, NFCWindowSceneDelegate {

    var window: UIWindow?
    var myViewModel = ViewModel()

    func scene(_ scene: UIScene, willConnectTo session: UISceneSession, options connectionOptions: UIScene.ConnectionOptions) {
        guard let windowScene = (scene as? UIWindowScene) else { return }
        
        // Check the connection options to see if the scene is being created
        // in response to an NFC event.
        guard let nfcEvent = connectionOptions.nfcEvent  else { return }
        // If there's an event, update the view model.
        myViewModel.receivedNFCEvent = nfcEvent

        // Update the view hierarchy by using myViewModel to create a new
        // view.
    }

    func windowScene(_ windowScene: UIWindowScene, didReceiveNFCWindowSceneEvent event: NFCWindowSceneEvent) {
        // Update the view model with the NFC event.
        myViewModel.receivedNFCEvent = event
        // Update the view hierarchy by using myViewModel to create a new
        // view.
     }
}
```

## Topics

### Events

- [NFCWindowSceneEvent.readerDetected](nfcwindowsceneevent/readerdetected.md): The eligible device detected the RF field of an NFC reader.
- [NFCWindowSceneEvent.presentation](nfcwindowsceneevent/presentation.md): The user performed a gesture to present an NFC display.
