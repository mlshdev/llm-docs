## Discussion

Call this method to register a new [AVSystemRouteSession](../avsystemroutesession-5i6j6.md) with the route before starting playback or communication. The session must be added to the route before calling its [startWithCompletionHandler:](../avsystemroutesession-5i6j6/startwithcompletionhandler_.md) method.

Adding a session establishes the association between the session and this route, enabling the system to manage the session’s lifecycle and route media appropriately. You can add multiple sessions to a single route to handle different media streams or communication channels.

Sessions are single-use. Once a session has been stopped, it cannot be added to a route again. Create a new [AVSystemRouteSession](../avsystemroutesession-5i6j6.md) for each new playback.

> **Note**

> You must remove sessions when they are no longer needed using [removeSession:](removesession_.md) to release system resources.
