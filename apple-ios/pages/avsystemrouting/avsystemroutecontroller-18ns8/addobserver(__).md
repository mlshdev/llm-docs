`true` if the observer was successfully added; `false` if the observer was already registered, if registration failed, or if a previous registration for the same observer was cleaned up due to the observer being deallocated.

## Discussion

Use this function to register an observer that receives callbacks when people interact with system routes in the route picker. The observer must conform to the [AVSystemRouteControllerObserver](../avsystemroutecontrollerobserver-5syvg.md) protocol and implement the required protocol function to handle routing events such as route activation and deactivation.

Important: Your app must declare support for extensions with the `MDESupportsUniversalURLPlayback` key and/or for specific protocols in the `MDESupportedProtocols` key of  the app’s `Info.plist`.  This observer will only be called back when a user selects a route that has been provided by an extension that matches one of your app’s specified supported protocols.
