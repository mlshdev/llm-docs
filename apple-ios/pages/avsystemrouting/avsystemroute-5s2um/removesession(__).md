Removes a session from the active route.

```

## Parameters

## Discussion

Call this function to unregister a session from the route when playback ends or when you no longer need the session. Removing a session stops any ongoing communication associated with that session and releases system resources.

If the session is currently active, this function stops the session before removing it.

> **Important**

> Always remove sessions when they are no longer needed to ensure proper cleanup of system resources and network connections. To start new playback after removing a session, create a new [AVSystemRouteSession](../avsystemroutesession-gp78.md) instance.
