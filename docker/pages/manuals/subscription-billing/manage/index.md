# Manage billing

You manage Docker plans, payment methods, invoices, usage, costs, credits, and
billing details from **Billing** in Docker Home. Billing applies to the
account you select, either your individual account or an organization.

For an organization, you must be an organization owner, or have a
[custom role](https://docs.docker.com/security/roles-and-permissions/custom-roles/permissions-reference/#billing)
with the **View billing** or **Manage billing** permission. Without it, Docker
Home shows **No access to billing**.

## Overview

**Overview** is the Billing home. It shows the default payment method, a tile
for each active plan, and your subscription totals with the next charge date.
The page also shows:

- **Monthly subscriptions** when you have a monthly plan
- **Annual subscriptions** when you have an annual plan
- An alert for a
  [failed payment](https://docs.docker.com/subscription-billing/manage/payment-method/#failed-payments)
  or a
  [bank account waiting for verification](https://docs.docker.com/subscription-billing/manage/payment-method/#verify-a-bank-account)

> \[!TIP]
>
> If Docker sales manages your subscription, the sidebar shows **Overview**
> only. Contact your Docker sales representative to renew, make changes, or
> request invoices.

## Invoices

**Invoices** lists every invoice with its date, number, description, status,
and amount. You can open an invoice or download a PDF when your Docker account
has a verified email address.

## Usage

**Usage** charts usage-based charges across billing periods. You can filter
by period, product, and meter, and export a CSV.

Plans that report usage appear here, including Docker Build Cloud minutes,
Testcontainers Cloud minutes, and Docker Agentic Platform compute. With no
usage-based plan, the page shows **No usage-based products**. See
[Plans](https://docs.docker.com/subscription-billing/plans/#choose-a-plan)
for which plans are metered.

## Costs

**Costs** shows charges for one billing period, grouped by the product each
charge is for. The page labels that column **Resource**. You can switch
billing periods and export a CSV. Costs also shows:

- Period status
- Amounts excluding tax
- **Cost to date** for the current period
- The subtotal for a closed period
- Credits, when the account has them

An invoice total can differ, because the invoice adds tax and any credits.

## Credits

**Credits** shows the credit balances for your products. Open a balance to
see each grant and its remaining amount. Docker applies these balances to
your costs at the end of the billing period.

## Settings

**Settings** shows the default payment method, billing address, tax ID, and
billing email. You can update the payment method, address, or billing email
on this page.
