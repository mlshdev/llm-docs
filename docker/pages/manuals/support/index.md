# Get support for Docker products

Docker offers multiple support channels depending on your subscription level and needs.

## Paid subscription support

All Docker Pro, Team, and Business subscribers receive email support for Docker products.

### Support response times

- Docker Pro: 3 business day response
- Docker Team: 2 business day response, 24×5 availability
- Docker Business: 1 business day response, 24×5 availability

Docker Verified Publisher (DVP) organizations follow the response times for their
Docker Pro, Team, or Business subscription. Without one of those subscriptions,
the following response times apply:

- DVP Starter: 3 business day response
- DVP Growth: 2 business day response, 24×5 availability

> \[!TIP]
>
> Premium Support with faster response times and 24×7 availability is available as an add-on for [Docker Business subscribers](https://www.docker.com/pricing?ref=Docs\&refAction=DocsSupport).

### Support severity levels

| :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Critical | Widespread or company-wide service outage affecting many customers or all users within a single organization. Business operations are halted with no workaround available. |
| High     | Team or department-level impact preventing significant users from accessing core functionality. Severe business impact with no workaround exists.                          |
| Medium   | Individual user or small group impact causing partial loss of functionality. Business operations continue, often with workarounds available but reduced productivity.      |

### Diagnostic data and privacy

When uploading diagnostics, the bundle may contain personal data such as usernames and IP addresses. Diagnostics bundles are only accessible to Docker, Inc. employees directly involved in diagnosing issues.

By default, Docker, Inc. deletes uploaded diagnostics bundles after 30 days. You may request removal of a diagnostics bundle by specifying the diagnostics ID or your GitHub ID. Docker, Inc. only uses the data to investigate specific user issues but may derive high-level (non-personal) metrics.

For more information, see [Docker Data Processing Agreement](https://www.docker.com/legal/data-processing-agreement).
