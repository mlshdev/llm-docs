# Two-factor authentication for your individual Docker account

**2FA requirements**

- Subscription: Personal, Pro
- For: Individuals

Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds a code from an authenticator app to
your password when you sign in to your Docker account. Someone who knows
your password still needs the code from your device to sign in.

> \[!TIP]
>
> Organization and company settings do not include 2FA. To control how
> members sign in across an organization, use
> [single sign-on](https://docs.docker.com/security/authentication/single-sign-on/).

## How two-factor authentication works

When you turn on 2FA, you pair a time-based one-time password (TOTP)
authenticator app with your account by scanning a QR code or entering a
text code. Any authenticator app that supports TOTP works. Docker keeps
one authenticator per account.

After repeated wrong codes, Docker returns `Too many failed login
attempts` and blocks further attempts for a short time.

## When Docker asks for the code

| Sign-in                                      | What Docker asks for                                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Browser sign-in to Docker Home or Docker Hub | Your password, then the code from your authenticator app                                                                                                                                |
| `docker login` with no username              | The same browser sign-in, if the browser is not already signed in                                                                                                                       |
| `docker login -u`, scripts, and CI           | A [personal access token](https://docs.docker.com/security/access-tokens/personal-access-tokens/) in the password prompt. Password sign-in from the CLI is not supported when 2FA is on |

## Recovery code

Docker gives you one recovery code when you turn on 2FA. The code signs
you in if you lose your authenticator app, so copy, download, or print it
and store it somewhere safe.

Docker emails the verified address on your account when you turn 2FA on
or off, when a recovery code is generated, and when a recovery code is
used to sign in. The email does not contain the code.

## Next steps

- [Turn 2FA on or off](https://docs.docker.com/security/authentication/2fa/manage/): Set up an authenticator app, save the recovery code, or turn 2FA off.
- [Recover your account](https://docs.docker.com/security/authentication/2fa/recover-hub-account/): Sign in with a recovery code, generate a new one, or contact Support.
