# Single sign-on overview

**SSO requirements**

- Subscription: Business
- For: Administrators

Single sign-on (SSO) lets users access Docker by authenticating through your
identity provider (IdP). You can configure SSO for an entire company,
including all associated organizations, or for a single organization. SSO
requires a Docker Business subscription or an
[AI Governance](https://docs.docker.com/accounts/organization/manage/manage-licenses/)
license.

## How SSO works

When a user signs in to Docker Desktop or Docker Hub, Docker sends them to
your IdP's sign-in page. The IdP accepts or denies the sign-in.

```mermaid {title="Sign-in when the IdP accepts the user" caption="The user has no Docker session, and the IdP accepts them."}

  actor User
  participant App as Docker Desktop<br/>or<br/>Docker Hub
  participant Login as Docker Login
  participant IdP as Your IdP

  User->>App: Open the app
  App->>Login: Start authentication
  Login->>IdP: Send the user to your IdP
  IdP->>User: Prompt for credentials
  User->>IdP: Enter credentials
  IdP->>Login: Confirm the user
  Login->>App: Return the user to the app
```

## Set up SSO

Setting up SSO is a multi-step procedure that moves between Docker and your
IdP.

```

After you finish the setup, users sign in to Docker services with their
company email address. When
[Just-in-Time provisioning](https://docs.docker.com/security/provisioning/just-in-time/)
is turned on, which is the default for an SSO connection, Docker adds each
user to your organization and team on first sign-in.

> \[!IMPORTANT]
>
> When SSO is enforced, the Docker CLI rejects password sign-in. Use a
> personal access token (PAT) to sign in to the CLI.
