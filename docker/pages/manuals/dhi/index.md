# Docker Hardened Images

Docker Hardened Images (DHI) provide minimal, secure, and production-ready
container images, Helm charts, and system packages maintained by Docker.
Designed to reduce vulnerabilities and simplify compliance, DHI integrates
easily into your existing Docker-based workflows with little to no retooling
required.

DHI is available in the following three subscriptions.
