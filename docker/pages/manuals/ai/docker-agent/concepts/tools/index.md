# Tools

*Tools give agents the ability to interact with the world — read files, run commands, search the web, query databases, and more.*

## How Tools Work

When an agent needs to perform an action, it makes a **tool call**. The Docker Agent runtime executes the tool and returns the result to the agent, which can then use it to continue its work.

1. Agent receives a user message
2. Agent decides it needs to use a tool (e.g., read a file)
3. Docker Agent executes the tool and returns the result
4. Agent incorporates the result and responds

> \[!NOTE]
> **Tool Confirmation**
>
> By default, Docker Agent asks for user confirmation before executing tools that have side effects (shell commands, file writes). Use `--yolo` to auto-approve all tool calls.

## Built-in Tools

Enable a built-in toolset by adding its `type` to the agent's `toolsets` list. For example:

```yaml
toolsets:
  - type: filesystem
  - type: shell
  - type: todo
```

Choose tools for the capabilities your agent needs:

- **Work with files and processes:** [Filesystem](https://docs.docker.com/ai/docker-agent/tools/filesystem/) and [Shell](https://docs.docker.com/ai/docker-agent/tools/shell/).
- **Plan and remember:** [Todo](https://docs.docker.com/ai/docker-agent/tools/todo/), [Memory](https://docs.docker.com/ai/docker-agent/tools/memory/), and [RAG](https://docs.docker.com/ai/docker-agent/tools/rag/).
- **Coordinate agents:** [Transfer Task](https://docs.docker.com/ai/docker-agent/tools/transfer-task/) and [Background Agents](https://docs.docker.com/ai/docker-agent/tools/background-agents/).

See [Built-in Tools](https://docs.docker.com/ai/docker-agent/configuration/tools/#built-in-tools) for the complete catalog, including each toolset's type and configuration reference.

## MCP Tools

Docker Agent supports the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) for extending agents with external tools. There are three ways to connect MCP tools:

- **Docker MCP** (recommended) — Run MCP servers in Docker containers via the [MCP Gateway](https://github.com/docker/mcp-gateway). Browse the [Docker MCP Catalog](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=\&type=mcp).
- **Local MCP (stdio)** — Run MCP servers as local processes communicating over stdin/stdout.
- **Remote MCP (Streamable HTTP / SSE)** — Connect to MCP servers running on a network. See [Remote MCP Servers](https://docs.docker.com/ai/docker-agent/features/remote-mcp/).

```yaml
toolsets:
  - type: mcp
    ref: docker:duckduckgo
```

See [Tool Config](https://docs.docker.com/ai/docker-agent/configuration/tools/#mcp-tools) for full MCP configuration reference.
