# Local policy

Local policy is how you, the developer, control which network destinations the
sandboxes on your machine can reach. You start from a preset that sets how much
access sandboxes have, then use the `sbx policy` command to allow what your work
needs and block what sandboxes shouldn't reach. If a sandbox uses a kit, the kit
brings the rules its agent needs, so you don't have to add them yourself.

Local policy covers only the network. You already decide which host paths a
sandbox mounts when you create it, and which MCP servers it can use when you
register them. Unless an organization policy applies to you, nothing restricts
those choices.

## How local policy works

Every outbound TCP request from a sandbox, including HTTP and SSH, passes
through a proxy on your host, which checks the request against your rules
before it leaves your machine. A rule names a destination and says whether to
allow or deny it. Other protocols are blocked by default. UDP needs the
experimental feature described in
[Allow outbound UDP](https://docs.docker.com/ai/governance/local/network-rules/#allow-outbound-udp), and ICMP is always
blocked.

Most rules match a hostname, such as `api.github.com`, or an IP address or CIDR
range. For HTTP traffic, a rule can also match the request's method, path, and
query parameters, so you can allow part of an API without allowing all of it. A
rule for other TCP traffic, such as SSH, can name a port, for example
`sbx policy allow network "myhost:22"`. For the full pattern syntax, including
wildcards, see [Network and HTTP rule syntax](https://docs.docker.com/ai/governance/reference/network-rules/).

## Start from a preset

Local policy starts from a network preset, which sets how much network access
sandboxes have before you add rules of your own. If you haven't chosen a preset,
the CLI prompts you to choose one when you run a sandbox in an interactive
terminal. If a preset is already set, including one carried over from an
earlier installation, the CLI uses it without prompting.

| Preset      | CLI value   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Open        | `allow-all` | All outbound TCP traffic is allowed. Equivalent to adding a wildcard allow rule with `sbx policy allow network "**"`.                                                                       |
| Balanced    | `balanced`  | Default deny, with a baseline allowlist covering AI provider APIs, package managers, OS package repositories, code hosts, container registries, cloud services, and certificate validation. |
| Locked Down | `deny-all`  | No baseline allow rules. Destinations need an allow rule from you or a kit.                                                                                                                 |

The **Balanced** preset's baseline allowlist is a good starting point for most
workflows. After you choose it, run `sbx policy ls` to see exactly which rules
it includes.

To set the preset without the prompt, or to choose again later, see
[Set or reset the preset](https://docs.docker.com/ai/governance/local/network-rules/#set-or-reset-the-preset).

## Add your own rules

The preset sets your global rules, which apply to every sandbox on your
machine. On top of the preset, you can add your own allow and deny rules,
either globally or scoped to one sandbox by name. For more details, see
[Manage local network rules](https://docs.docker.com/ai/governance/local/network-rules/).

## Use kits that add rules

Kits, including the built-in agent kits, can add network rules to the sandboxes
that use them, such as the API endpoints an agent needs. For more details, see
[Use kits](https://docs.docker.com/ai/sandboxes/customize/use-kits/).

## How rules combine

Without organization governance, your rules and kit rules combine: a
destination is allowed if any rule allows it, and a deny rule from any source
takes precedence over an allow rule. Kit rules apply under any preset,
including **Locked Down**, because a preset isn't an explicit deny rule.

How a request that no rule matches is handled depends on your preset. Under
**Open**, every destination is allowed. Under **Balanced** and **Locked Down**,
the request is blocked and asks for your approval instead of being denied
outright, so you can open access to each destination as a sandbox needs it.
For more details, see [Respond to approval requests](https://docs.docker.com/ai/governance/local/approvals/).

When an organization policy is enforced for you, it changes which of your
local rules apply. For more details, see
[How organization policy relates to local and kit rules](https://docs.docker.com/ai/governance/organization/policies/#how-organization-policy-relates-to-local-and-kit-rules).

## Try it out

[Try out local policy](https://docs.docker.com/ai/governance/local/try-it-out/) walks you through an example that allows
and blocks destinations for one sandbox.
