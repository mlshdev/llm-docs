# Docker Build GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a popular CI/CD platform for automating your build, test, and
deployment pipeline. Docker provides a set of official GitHub Actions for you to
use in your workflows. These official actions are reusable, easy-to-use
components for building, annotating, and pushing images.

The following GitHub Actions are available:

- [Build and push Docker images](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/build-and-push-docker-images):
  build and push Docker images with BuildKit.
- [Docker Buildx Bake](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/docker-buildx-bake):
  enables using high-level builds with [Bake](https://docs.docker.com/build/bake/).
- [Docker Login](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/docker-login):
  sign in to a Docker registry.
- [Docker Setup Buildx](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/docker-setup-buildx):
  creates and boots a BuildKit builder.
- [Docker Metadata action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/docker-metadata-action):
  extracts metadata from Git reference and GitHub events to generate tags,
  labels, and annotations.
- [Docker Setup Compose](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/docker-setup-compose):
  installs and sets up [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).
- [Docker Setup Docker](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/docker-setup-docker):
  installs Docker Engine.
- [Docker Setup QEMU](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/docker-setup-qemu):
  installs [QEMU](https://github.com/qemu/qemu) static binaries for
  multi-platform builds.
- [Docker Scout](https://github.com/docker/scout-action):
  analyze Docker images for security vulnerabilities.

Using Docker's actions provides an easy-to-use interface, while still allowing
flexibility for customizing build parameters.

## Get started with GitHub Actions

The [Introduction to GitHub Actions with Docker](https://docs.docker.com/guides/gha/) guide walks
you through the process of setting up and using Docker GitHub Actions for
building Docker images, and pushing images to Docker Hub.
