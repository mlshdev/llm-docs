# sbx mcp ls

List MCP servers

**Usage:** `sbx mcp ls [flags]`

## Description

List registered MCP servers under the gateway that serves them.

The GATEWAY column reports where each server runs, who controls it, and the
signed-in identity; each row also reports its transport and whether it is usable now.
Servers needing authorization carry the 'sbx mcp auth' next step.

A server registered with custom headers is marked as such; one whose header
placeholder has no stored value carries the 'sbx secret set' next step, and one
whose headers this gateway cannot send is flagged unsupported. Either way the
server cannot connect as it stands. Run 'sbx mcp inspect <name>' for the headers
themselves and the state of each placeholder.

Auth status is read without starting an OAuth flow — from the local token store
in local data-plane mode, otherwise from the hosted control plane.

With --cloud:
List MCP servers reported by existing cloud sandbox gateways, with the
sandboxes that reference each server. Servers skipped by a gateway are excluded.
This is not a complete inventory of configured servers: unused configurations
and gateways that do not report server names are absent, including with --quiet.

Specify a sandbox to show its gateway state and host, requested servers, and
skipped servers.

| `-D`, `--debug` |         | Enable debug logging                                                                                                                                   |

## Examples

```console
sbx mcp ls

  # Machine-readable output for scripting
  sbx mcp ls --json

  # Cloud: list servers reported across existing sandboxes
  sbx --cloud mcp ls

  # Cloud: show a cloud sandbox's gateway by name or sbx_ ID
  sbx --cloud mcp ls my-sbx
```
