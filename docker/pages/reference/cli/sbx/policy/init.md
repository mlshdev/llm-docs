# sbx policy init

Initialize the global network policy

**Usage:** `sbx policy init <allow-all|balanced|deny-all> [flags]`

## Description

Initialize the global network policy that applies to all sandboxes.

This sets the initial global network policy and must be run before adding
custom allow/deny rules or starting a sandbox for the first time. It is a
one-time setup: once initialized, use "sbx policy reset" to start over.

This is the initial global policy, not a per-sandbox default; you can change
it later. Per-sandbox rules, including those added by kits such as the
built-in agent kits, apply on top for individual sandboxes.

Available policies:
allow-all   All outbound network traffic is allowed
balanced    Typical development traffic is allowed, such as AI services and package registries
deny-all    All outbound network traffic is blocked

After initializing, use "sbx policy allow/deny/rm" to change the global policy.
Use "sbx policy reset" to clear all policies and start over.

With --cloud:
Set the default network mode of the cloud policy.

There is no one-time setup: init sets the default mode for the account, or for
one sandbox with --sandbox, keeps the existing allow and deny rules, and can be
run again. balanced is deny-all plus the balanced allow list added to the scope.
Use "sbx --cloud policy reset" to clear the rules first.

## Options

| Option      | Default | Description                                         |
| ----------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `--sandbox` |         | Target a single cloud sandbox's policy (cloud only) |

## Global options

| Option          | Default | Description                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--cloud`       |         | Dispatch to Docker Cloud Sandboxes API instead of local sandboxd (supported by a growing set of verbs — run 'sbx --cloud --help' for the current list) |
| `-D`, `--debug` |         | Enable debug logging                                                                                                                                   |

## Examples

```console
# Initialize with the balanced policy — recommended
  sbx policy init balanced

  # Allow all traffic
  sbx policy init allow-all

  # Block everything, then allow specific sites
  sbx policy init deny-all
  sbx policy allow network api.example.com:443

  # Set the account default to balanced
  sbx --cloud policy init balanced

  # Block everything for one sandbox, keeping its allow rules
  sbx --cloud policy init deny-all --sandbox my-sandbox
```
