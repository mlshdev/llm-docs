# sbx setup

Detect host configuration and prepare Docker Sandboxes

**Usage:** `sbx setup [COMMAND]`

> [!NOTE]
> This command is experimental.

## Description

Detect what is already configured on your host and prepare Docker Sandboxes.

Agent secrets are detected from the built-in agent kit specs and the
env vars set on this host, and accepted secrets are imported into the global
secrets store (the same store as "sbx secret set"). When SSH_AUTH_SOCK is set,
setup can enable SSH-agent forwarding and either use each client's current
socket or persist a fixed socket path.

## Global options

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--cloud` |  | Dispatch to Docker Cloud Sandboxes API instead of local sandboxd (supported by a growing set of verbs — run 'sbx --cloud --help' for the current list) |
| `--cloud-api-url` | `https://api.sandboxes-cloud.docker.com` | Cloud Sandboxes API base URL; only used with --cloud. Defaults to prod (https://api.sandboxes-cloud.docker.com). Set DOCKER_CLOUD_API_URL or pass this flag to override; a legacy value ending in /v1 is accepted. |
| `-D`, `--debug` |  | Enable debug logging |
