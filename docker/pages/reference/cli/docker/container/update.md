# docker container update

Update configuration of one or more containers

**Usage:** `docker container update [OPTIONS] CONTAINER [CONTAINER...]`

**Aliases:** docker container update, docker update

## Description

The `docker update` command dynamically updates container configuration.
You can use this command to prevent containers from consuming too many
resources from their Docker host.  With a single command, you can place
limits on a single container or on many. To specify more than one container,
provide space-separated list of container names or IDs.

> [!WARNING]
> The `docker update` and `docker container update` commands are not supported
> for Windows containers.

## Options

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--blkio-weight` |  | Block IO (relative weight), between 10 and 1000, or 0 to disable (default 0) |
| `--cpu-period` |  | Limit CPU CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler) period |
| `--cpu-quota` |  | Limit CPU CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler) quota |
| `--cpu-rt-period` |  | Limit the CPU real-time period in microseconds (API 1.25+) |
| `--cpu-rt-runtime` |  | Limit the CPU real-time runtime in microseconds (API 1.25+) |
| `-c`, `--cpu-shares` |  | CPU shares (relative weight) |
| `--cpus` |  | Number of CPUs (API 1.29+) |
| `--cpuset-cpus` |  | CPUs in which to allow execution (0-3, 0,1) |
| `--cpuset-mems` |  | MEMs in which to allow execution (0-3, 0,1) |
| `-m`, `--memory` |  | Memory limit |
| `--memory-reservation` |  | Memory soft limit |
| `--memory-swap` |  | Swap limit equal to memory plus swap: -1 to enable unlimited swap |
| `--pids-limit` |  | Tune container pids limit (set -1 for unlimited) (API 1.40+) |
| `--restart` |  | Restart policy to apply when a container exits |

## Examples

The following sections illustrate ways to use this command.

### Update a container's cpu-shares (--cpu-shares) {#cpu-shares}

To limit a container's cpu-shares to 512, first identify the container
name or ID. You can use `docker ps` to find these values. You can also
use the ID returned from the `docker run` command.  Then, do the following:

```console
$ docker update --cpu-shares 512 abebf7571666
```

### Update a container with cpu-shares and memory (-m, --memory) {#memory}

To update multiple resource configurations for multiple containers:

```console
$ docker update --cpu-shares 512 -m 300M abebf7571666 hopeful_morse
```

### Update a container's restart policy (--restart) {#restart}

You can change a container's restart policy on a running container. The new
restart policy takes effect instantly after you run `docker update` on a
container.

To update restart policy for one or more containers:

```console
$ docker update --restart=on-failure:3 abebf7571666 hopeful_morse
```

Note that if the container is started with `--rm` flag, you cannot update the restart
policy for it. The `AutoRemove` and `RestartPolicy` are mutually exclusive for the
container.
