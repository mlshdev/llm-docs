# docker scout compare

Compare two images and display differences (experimental)

**Usage:** `docker scout compare --to IMAGE|DIRECTORY|ARCHIVE [IMAGE|DIRECTORY|ARCHIVE]`

**Aliases:** docker scout compare, docker scout diff

> [!NOTE]
> This command is experimental.

## Description

The `docker scout compare` command analyzes two images and displays a comparison.

> This command is **experimental** and its behaviour might change in the future

The intended use of this command is to compare two versions of the same image.
For instance, when a new image is built and compared to the version running in production.

If no image is specified, the most recently built image is used
as a comparison target.

The following artifact types are supported:

- Images
- OCI layout directories
- Tarball archives, as created by `docker save`
- Local directory or file

By default, the tool expects an image reference, such as:

- `redis`
- `curlimages/curl:7.87.0`
- `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime:7.0`

If the artifact you want to analyze is an OCI directory, a tarball archive, a local file or directory,
or if you want to control from where the image will be resolved, you must prefix the reference with one of the following:

- `image://` (default) use a local image, or fall back to a registry lookup
- `local://` use an image from the local image store (don't do a registry lookup)
- `registry://` use an image from a registry (don't use a local image)
- `oci-dir://` use an OCI layout directory
- `archive://` use a tarball archive, as created by `docker save`
- `fs://` use a local directory or file
- `sbom://` SPDX file or in-toto attestation file with SPDX predicate or `syft` json SBOM file

## Examples

### Compare the most recently built image to the latest tag

```console
$ docker scout compare --to namespace/repo:latest
```

### Compare local build to the same tag from the registry

```console
$ docker scout compare local://namespace/repo:latest --to registry://namespace/repo:latest
```

### Ignore base images

```console
$ docker scout compare --ignore-base --to namespace/repo:latest namespace/repo:v1.2.3-pre
```

### Generate a markdown output

```console
$ docker scout compare --format markdown --to namespace/repo:latest namespace/repo:v1.2.3-pre
```

### Only compare maven packages and only display critical vulnerabilities for maven packages

```console
$ docker scout compare --only-package-type maven --only-severity critical --to namespace/repo:latest namespace/repo:v1.2.3-pre
```

### Show all policy results for both images

```console
docker scout compare --to namespace/repo:latest namespace/repo:v1.2.3-pre
```
