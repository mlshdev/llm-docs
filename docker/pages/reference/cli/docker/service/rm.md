# docker service rm

Remove one or more services

**Usage:** `docker service rm SERVICE [SERVICE...]`

**Aliases:** docker service rm, docker service remove

## Description

Removes the specified services from the swarm.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a cluster management command, and must be executed on a swarm
> manager node. To learn about managers and workers, refer to the
> [Swarm mode section](/engine/swarm/) in the
> documentation.

$ docker service rm redis

redis

$ docker service ls
