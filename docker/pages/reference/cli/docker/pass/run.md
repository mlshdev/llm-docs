# docker pass run

Run a command with `se://` environment references resolved.

**Usage:** `docker pass run -- CMD [ARGS...] [flags]`

> [!NOTE]
> This command is experimental.

## Description

Scans the current environment (plus any `--env-file` inputs) for variables
whose value is exactly `se://<ID|pattern>`. Each reference is resolved through the
secrets-engine daemon and the resolved value is passed to the child process.
The child inherits stdin, stdout, and stderr.

Requires the secrets-engine daemon (Docker Desktop) to be running.

If any reference cannot be resolved, the command fails before the child is
started and exits non-zero.

## Options

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--env-file` |  | Read environment variables from a dotenv-formatted file. Repeatable; later files override earlier files and the process environment. |

## Examples

### Run a command with one secret in its environment:

```console
$ SE_TOKEN=se://gh-token docker pass run -- gh repo list
```

### Multiple references:

```console
$ DB_PASSWORD=se://myapp/postgres/password API_KEY=se://myapp/anthropic/api-key docker pass run -- ./my-binary
```

### Resolve references from a dotenv file:

```console
$ docker pass run --env-file .env -- ./my-binary
```

### Multiple files (later overrides earlier; files override the process environment):

```console
$ docker pass run --env-file .env --env-file .env.local -- ./my-binary
```
