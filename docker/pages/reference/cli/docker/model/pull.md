# docker model pull

Pull a model from Docker Hub or HuggingFace to your local environment

**Usage:** `docker model pull MODEL`

## Description

Pull a model to your local environment. Downloaded models also appear in the Docker Desktop Dashboard.

## Examples

### Pulling a model from Docker Hub

```console
docker model pull ai/smollm2
```

### Pulling from HuggingFace

You can pull GGUF models directly from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models?library=gguf).

**Note about quantization:** If no tag is specified, the command tries to pull the `Q4_K_M` version of the model.
If `Q4_K_M` doesn't exist, the command pulls the first GGUF found in the **Files** view of the model on HuggingFace.
To specify the quantization, provide it as a tag, for example:
`docker model pull hf.co/bartowski/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-GGUF:Q4_K_S`

```console
docker model pull hf.co/bartowski/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-GGUF
```
