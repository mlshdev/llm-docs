# docker model run

Run a model and interact with it using a submitted prompt or chat mode

**Usage:** `docker model run MODEL [PROMPT]`

## Description

When you run a model, Docker calls an inference server API endpoint hosted by the Model Runner through Docker Desktop. The model stays in memory until another model is requested, or until a pre-defined inactivity timeout is reached (currently 5 minutes).

You do not have to use Docker model run before interacting with a specific model from a host process or from within a container. Model Runner transparently loads the requested model on-demand, assuming it has been pulled and is locally available.

You can also use chat mode in the Docker Desktop Dashboard when you select the model in the **Models** tab.

## Options

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--color` | `no` | Use colored output (auto\|yes\|no) |
| `--debug` |  | Enable debug logging |
| `-d`, `--detach` |  | Load the model in the background without interaction |
| `--openaiurl` |  | OpenAI-compatible API endpoint URL to chat with |
| `--websearch` |  | Enable web search tool during chat |

## Examples

### One-time prompt

```console
docker model run ai/smollm2 "Hi"
```

Output:

```console
Hello! How can I assist you today?
```

### Interactive chat

```console
docker model run ai/smollm2
```

Output:

```console
> Hi
Hi there! It's SmolLM, AI assistant. How can I help you today?
> /bye
```

### Pre-load a model

```console
docker model run --detach ai/smollm2
```

This loads the model into memory without interaction, ensuring maximum performance for subsequent requests.
