# docker compose convert

Converts the compose file to platform's canonical format

**Usage:** `docker compose convert [OPTIONS] [SERVICE...]`

**Aliases:** docker compose convert, docker compose config

## Description

`docker compose convert` renders the actual data model to be applied on the target platform. When used with the Docker engine,
it merges the Compose files set by `-f` flags, resolves variables in the Compose file, and expands short-notation into
the canonical format.

To allow smooth migration from docker-compose, this subcommand declares alias `docker compose config`
