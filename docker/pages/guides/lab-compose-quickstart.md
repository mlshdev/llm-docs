# Lab: Docker Compose Quickstart

Build a Python Flask and Redis hit-counter app using Docker Compose, starting
from a bare `compose.yaml` and progressively adding production-quality
features at each step.

## Launch the lab

```console
$ docker compose -p labspace -f oci://dockersamples/labspace-compose-quickstart up -d
```

Open <http://localhost> in your browser.

```console
$ docker compose -p labspace down
```

## What you'll learn

By the end of this Labspace, you will have completed the following:

- Define a multi-service application in a `compose.yaml` file and manage it with Compose commands
- Control service startup order using health checks and `depends_on` conditions
- Iterate on code without manual rebuilds using Compose watch mode
- Persist data across container restarts with named volumes
- Modularize a stack across multiple files using the `include` directive
- Use `config`, `logs`, and `exec` to inspect and debug a running stack

## Modules

| # | Module                           | Description                                                           |
| - | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | Introduction                     | Tour the starter app and verify the environment                       |
| 2 | Defining Services                | Write the first `compose.yaml` and bring up the Flask and Redis stack |
| 3 | Health Checks & Startup Order    | Add a Redis healthcheck and `depends_on` to eliminate race conditions |
| 4 | Live Development with Watch Mode | Configure watch mode to sync code changes without manual rebuilds     |
| 5 | Persistence & Debugging          | Add a named volume so Redis data survives `docker compose down`       |
| 6 | Using Multiple Compose Files     | Extract Redis into `infra.yaml` and compose files with `include`      |
| 7 | Additional Commands              | Use `config`, `logs -f`, and `exec` to inspect the running stack      |
| 8 | Recap                            | Review what was built and explore next steps                          |
