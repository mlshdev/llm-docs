# Lab: AI Fundamentals for Developers

Get hands-on with the four core pillars of AI application development: models,
prompt engineering, tool calling, and RAG. This lab runs entirely on your
machine using Docker Model Runner — no API key or cloud account required.

## Launch the lab

```console
$ docker compose -p labspace -f oci://dockersamples/labspace-ai-fundamentals up -d
```

Open <http://localhost> in your browser.

```console
$ docker compose -p labspace down
```

## What you'll learn

By the end of this Labspace, you will have completed the following:

- Understand the Chat Completions API and how to structure messages for a model
- Use prompt engineering techniques including system prompts, few-shot examples, and structured output
- Implement tool calling and the agentic loop in code
- Build a RAG pipeline that grounds model responses in your own data
