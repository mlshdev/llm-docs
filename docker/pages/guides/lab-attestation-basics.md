# Lab: Container Image Attestations

Prove where your container images came from and that they haven't been
tampered with. This lab walks through generating SBOMs and SLSA build
provenance with BuildKit, signing images with Cosign, and writing VEX
statements to declare which CVEs affect your image — the techniques used
to meet supply chain security requirements like NIST SSDF and EO 14028.

## Launch the lab

```console
$ docker compose -p labspace -f oci://dockersamples/labspace-attestation-basics up -d
```

Open <http://localhost> in your browser.

```console
$ docker compose -p labspace down
```

## What you'll learn

By the end of this Labspace, you will have completed the following:

- Generate and inspect an SPDX SBOM attached to a container image with `--sbom=true`
- Generate SLSA build provenance with `--provenance=mode=max` and understand how multi-stage builds are fully recorded
- Install Cosign and use key-based signing to sign and verify a container image
- Write an OpenVEX statement to declare CVE exploitability status and attach it as a signed attestation
- Understand how SBOMs, provenance, signatures, and VEX complement each other in a complete supply chain story
