# Lab: Getting Started with Docker

Start from zero and learn Docker's core building blocks. You'll run pre-built
containers, write a `Dockerfile` to package a Node.js app, build your own
image, and see container immutability and isolation in action.

## Launch the lab

```console
$ docker compose -p labspace -f oci://dockersamples/labspace-container-getting-started up -d
```

Open <http://localhost> in your browser.

```console
$ docker compose -p labspace down
```

## What you'll learn

By the end of this Labspace, you will have completed the following:

- Understand what containers are and how they differ from virtual machines
- Run containers in the background, inspect their logs and filesystem, and manage their lifecycle
- Write a `Dockerfile` to package an application, using layer caching for fast rebuilds
- Build a custom image with `docker build` and run it as a container
- Optionally publish your image to Docker Hub
