# Lab: Migrating a Node App to Docker Hardened Images

Migrate a Node.js application from a standard `node:24-trixie-slim` base image
to a Docker Hardened Image. You'll measure the before-and-after impact on CVE
count, image size, and policy compliance using Docker Scout, then explore the
supply chain attestations DHI ships with every image.

## Launch the lab

```console
$ docker compose -p labspace -f oci://dockersamples/labspace-dhi-node up -d
```

Open <http://localhost> in your browser.

```console
$ docker compose -p labspace down
```

## What you'll learn

By the end of this Labspace, you will have completed the following:

- Analyze a Node.js container image with Docker Scout to identify CVE and policy failures
- Rewrite a Dockerfile to use a multi-stage build with DHI dev and runtime variants
- Compare image size and vulnerability counts before and after the migration
- Inspect supply chain attestations included with Docker Hardened Images (SBOMs, SLSA, VEX)
- Export VEX documents for integration with external scanners such as Grype or Trivy
