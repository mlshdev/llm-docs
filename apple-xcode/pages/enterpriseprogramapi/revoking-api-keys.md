## Overview

Revoke an API key immediately if it becomes inactive, lost, or compromised. A revoked API key denies access to the Enterprise Program API on your organization’s behalf.

> **Important**

>  Once you revoke an API key, you can’t reinstate it. Revoked keys are displayed for 30 days on the Integrations page under the Revoked heading.
