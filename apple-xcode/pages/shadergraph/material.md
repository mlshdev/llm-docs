# Material

**Framework:** ShaderGraph  
**Kind:** ShaderGraph Node Group

Encapsulate a set of shader graph nodes into a single module.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

`Material` nodes help you divide your graph into subsets of nodes, each with distinct inputs and outputs. A [Node Graph](material/node-graph.md) appears as a single node within your main graph. Editing that node hides the main graph and gives you an empty space that you fill with additional nodes. Use that space to build a specific portion of your main graph, and use the [Node Graph](material/node-graph.md) to define the inputs and outputs to that separate space.

## Topics

### Nodes

- [Node Graph](material/node-graph.md): A node that can contain shading nodes and other node graphs.

- [2D-Texture](2d-texture.md): Load and configure 2D texture files.
- [3D-Procedural](3d-procedural.md): Generate 3D noise patterns programmatically for your material.
