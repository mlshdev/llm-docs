## Parameter Descriptions

- **`Top`**: The top value of the interpolation.
- **`Bottom`**: The bottom value of the interpolation.
- **`Texture coordinates`**: The 2D coordinate at which the data is read for mapping the texture onto a surface. The default is to use the current UV coordinates, in which U is the horizontal axis and V is the vertical axis.

## Discussion

This node uses interpolation to create a vertical ramp or gradient from two values. Any point within the output ramp is a mix of the two values. A given point is more similar to the value that its vertical position is closer to. Below is a an example of a simple node graph that uses `Ramp Vertical` to create a color gradient:

The image below shows the resulting texture, along with the color values on either side:
