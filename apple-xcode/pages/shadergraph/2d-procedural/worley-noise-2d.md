## Parameter description

- **`Texture Coordinates`**: The 2D coordinate at which the data is read for mapping a texture to a surface. The default uses the current UV coordinates, in which U is the horizontal axis and V is the vertical axis.
- **`Jitter`**: The amount to *jitter* or shift the center of each cell experiences. The default value is `1.0`. A smaller value creates a more regular pattern, and `0` creates perfect squares.

## Discussion

The `Worley Noise 2D` node procedurally generates nonuniform cellular regions. Creates a finite number of center points, and each region is a polygon that surrounds the points closest to each center point. Below is an example of a simple node graph that uses the `Worley Noise 2D` node to generate a black and white pattern procedurally:

Multiply the incoming texture coordinates with a constant float, which changes the frequency of the generated noise. A higher value corresponds to the pattern repeating more often. You then run the output through a convert node to change it to a black and white color value.
