## Parameter descriptions

- **`Left`**: The left value of the interpolation.
- **`Right`**: The right value of the interpolation.
- **`Texture Coordinates`**: The 2D coordinate at which the data is read in order to map the texture onto a surface. The default is to use the current UV coordinates, in which U is the horizontal axis and V is the vertical axis.

## Discussion

This node uses interpolation to create a horizontal ramp or gradient from two values. Any point within the output ramp is a mix of the two values. A given point is more similar to the value that its horizontal position is closer to. Below is a an example of a simple node graph that uses `Ramp Horizontal` to create a color gradient:

The image below shows the resulting texture, along with the color values on either side:
