## Parameter descriptions

- **`Top left`**: The top-left value of the four-point interpolation.
- **`Top right`**: The top-right value of the four-point interpolation.
- **`Bottom left`**: The bottom-left value of the four-point interpolation.
- **`Bottom right`**: The bottom-right value of the four-point interpolation.
- **`Texture Coordinates`**: The 2D coordinate at which the data is read for mapping the texture onto a surface. The default is to use the current UV coordinates, in which U is the horizontal axis and V is the vertical axis.

## Discussion

This node uses bilinear interpolation to create a ramp from four corner values. Any point within the output ramp is a mix of one of the four corner values. A given point is more similar to a corner value the closer its position is to that corner. Below is a an example of a simple node graph that uses `Ramp 4 Corners` to create a gradient with four different colors:

The image below shows the resulting texture along with the color values on each corner:
