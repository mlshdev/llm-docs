## Parameter descriptions

- **`In`**: The input from which to extract a value.
- **`Index`**: The index of the input from which to extract a value. Default value is `0`.

## Discussion

The Extract node takes its `In` input and always outputs a singular `Float`. The value of the node’s output is the value of number in the `Index` position of `In`. For example, if `In` is equal to a `Vector3` of (10,15,20) and `Index` is `1`, the output is `15`.
