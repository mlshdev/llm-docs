## Parameter description

- **`File X`**: The image file to project from the positive X direction toward the origin.
- **`File Y`**: The image file to project from the positive Y direction toward the origin.
- **`File Z`**: The image file to project from the positive Z direction toward the origin.
- **`Default`**: The default value the node uses if any of the ​file​ references fail to resolve.
- **`Position`**: The 3D coordinates at which the node reads data for mapping the texture onto a surface. The default uses the current 3D object-space coordinates.
- **`Normal`**: The 3D normal vector the node uses for blending; the default is the current object-space surface normal.
- **`Filter Type`**: The type of texture filtering the node uses; the default is `linear`.

## Discussion

Use the `Triplanar Projection` node to blend three different images together based on the vector normal of each point on the object. Areas of the object that are parallel with a coordinate axis cause the node to fully show the respective image. Areas of the object between the coordinate axis cause the node to render a mix of the images based on how close the normal is to each of the axis. The closer the normal is to the normal of a coordinate axis the strong the respective image is in the blend. Below is an example of a simple node graph that uses the `Triplanar Projection` node to blend the same grass image in the X and Y directions, and a tile texture in the Z direction:

Below, the resulting texture applies to a sphere:
