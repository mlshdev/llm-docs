## Parameter Types

| Input | Type |

| `Foreground` | Color4 |
| `Background` | Color4 |
| `Mix` | Float |

| Output | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `Out` | Color4 |

## Parameter descriptions

- **`Foreground`**: The `color4` foreground input. `F` represents the RGB component of this parameter. `f` represents the alpha component of this parameter.
- **`Background`**: The `color4` background input. `B` represents the RGB component of this parameter. `b`represents the alpha component of this parameter.
- **`Mix`**: The weight of the blend operation. The higher the value of `Mix`, the more apparent the effect of the blend operation. The default value is `1`. Values outside of the range `0-1` produce an undefined effect outside of the node’s intended function.

## Discussion

The Matte node determines its output using the alpha channels of the foreground and background inputs. The RGB component of the output is `Ff+B(1-f)` and the alpha component of the output is `f+b(1-f)`. Below is a simple node graph that uses the In node to blend a wood and rock texture.

Below are the two original images, the image representation of the alpha of the foreground, and the resulting blended texture applied to a cube.
