# Disjoint Over

**Framework:** ShaderGraph  
**Kind:** ShaderGraph Node  
**Availability:** iOS 17.0+ · iPadOS 17.0+ · Mac Catalyst 17.0+ · macOS 14.0+ · tvOS 26.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

A merge operation that layers foreground over background color, but assumes no overlap in partially transparent areas covered by both.

## Parameter Types

| Input | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `Foreground` | Color4 |
| `Background` | Color4 |
| `Mix` | Float |

| Output | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `Out` | Color4 |

## Parameter descriptions

- **`Foreground`**: The `color4` foreground input. `F` represents the RGB component of this parameter. `f` represents the alpha component of this parameter.
- **`Background`**: The `color4` background input. `B` represents the RGB component of this parameter. `b`represents the alpha component of this parameter.
- **`Mix`**: The weight of the blend operation. The higher the value of `Mix`, the more apparent the effect of the blend operation. The default value is `1`. Values outside of the range `0-1` produce an undefined effect outside of the node’s intended function.

## Discussion

The Disjoint Over node performs one of two mixes based on the alpha channels of the foreground and background inputs. If `f+b<=1`, then the RGB component of the output is `F+B`. If `f+b>1`, then the RGB component of the output is `F+b(1-f)/b`. The alpha component of the output for this node is always the smaller value between `f+b` or 1. Below is a simple node graph that uses the Disjoint Over node to blend a tile and rock texture:

The graph remaps the alpha of the rock texture from a range of `0-1` to a range of `-1-2` in order to show more of the effect of both possible modes of the blend. Below are the two original images and their resulting blended texture applied to a cube:
