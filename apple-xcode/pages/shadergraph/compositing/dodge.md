## Parameter Description

- **`Foreground`**: The foreground input. Represented by `F` in the mathmatical equation.
- **`Background`**: The background input. Represented by `B` in the mathmatical equation.
- **`Mix`**: The weight of the blend operation. The higher the `Mix`, the greater the intensity of the blend operation, and the more the effect is visually apparent. The default value is `1`. Values outside of the range `0-1` produce an undefined effect outside of the node’s intended function.

## Discussion

The Dodge node lightens each area in the background based on the lightness of the corresponding area in the foreground, represented by the equation `B / (1 - F)`. Below is an example of a simple node graph that uses the the dodge node to lighten a brick texture:

Use a [Noise 2D](../2d-procedural/noise-2d.md) node to generate Perlin noise, and use the output of that texture as the foreground in the dodge node. This process causes the background brick texture to lighten according to the procedural pattern. Below, the resulting texture applies to a cube:
