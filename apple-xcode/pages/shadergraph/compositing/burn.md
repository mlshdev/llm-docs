## Parameter descriptions

- **`Foreground`**: The foreground input. Represented by `F` in the mathmatical equation.
- **`Background`**: The background input. Represented by `B` in the mathmatical equation.
- **`Mix`**: The weight of the blend effect. The higher the `Mix`, the greater the intensity of the blend operation, and the more the effect is visually apparent. The default value is `1`. Values outside of the range `0-1` produce an undefined effect outside of the node’s intended function.

## Discussion

The `Burn` node darkens each area in the background based on the darkness of the corresponding area in the foreground, represented by the equation `1 - (1 - B) / F`. Below is an example of a node graph that uses the `Burn` node to darken a brick texture:

Use a [Noise 2D](../2d-procedural/noise-2d.md) node to generate Perlin noise, and use the output of that texture as the foreground in the `Burn` node. This process darkens the background brick texture according to the procedural pattern. Below, the resulting texture applies to a cube:
