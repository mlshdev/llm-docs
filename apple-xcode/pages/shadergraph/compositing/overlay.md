**Availability:** iOS 17.0+ · iPadOS 17.0+ · Mac Catalyst 17.0+ · macOS 14.0+ · tvOS 26.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

A blend operation that multiplies dark areas and screens light areas.

## Parameter descriptions

- **`Foreground`**: The foreground input. Represented by `F` in the mathmatical equation.
- **`Background`**: The background input. Represented by `B` in the mathmatical equation.
- **`Mix`**: The weight of the blend operation. The higher the value of `Mix`, the more apparent the effect of the blend operation. The default value is `1`. Values outside of the range `0-1` produce an undefined effect outside of the node’s intended function.

## Discussion

The `Overlay` node has one of two effects:

- If `F+B` is less than `0.5`, then the node outputs a value of `2*F*B`.
- If `F+B` is greater than or equal to `0.5`, then it outputs`1-(1-F)(1-B)`, which creates the same visual effect as the [Screen](screen.md) node. Visually the node makes dark areas of the blended texture even darker and light areas of the blended texture even lighter.

Below is an example of a simple node graph that uses the `Overlay` node to blend two images together into a single material:

Below are two images and their resulting blended texture applied to a cube:

### Nodes

- [Premultiply](premultiply.md): Multiplies the RGB channels of the input by the alpha channel.
