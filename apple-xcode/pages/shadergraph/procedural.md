# Procedural

**Framework:** ShaderGraph  
**Kind:** ShaderGraph Node Group

Add a constant number, vector, matrix, color, string, or other value to your graph.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Use Procedural nodes to manage constant values within your graph. Configure a Procedural node with a constant value in the Reality Composer Pro inspector, and use it as an input to other nodes. You can also use the input side of the node to store values from other parts of your graph.

## Topics
