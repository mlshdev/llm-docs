## Parameter descriptions

- **`In`**: The input value to remap.
- **`Low`**: The low end value of the input range; the default value is `0.0`.
- **`High`**: The high end value of the input range; the default value is `1.0`.

## Discussion

The `Smooth Step` node outputs a smooth remapping using Hermite interpolation. Any input with a value lower than the `Low` parameter results in an output of `0`. Any input with a value higher than the `High` parameter results in an output of `1`.
