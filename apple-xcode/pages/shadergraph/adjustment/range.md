## Parameter descriptions

- **`In`**: The input value to remap.
- **`In Low`**: The low-end value of the input range; the default is `0.0`.
- **`In High`**: The high-end value of the input range; the default is `1.0`.
- **`Gamma`**: The inverse exponent to apply to the input value. The inverse exponent is applied after first mapping the input range to the range `0..1`. The default is `1.0`.
- **`Out Low`**: The low-end value of the output range. The default is `0.0`.
- **`Out High`**: The high-end value of the output range. The default is `1.0`.
- **`Do Clamp`**: The Boolean value that indicates if the output is clamped. If `true`, the output clamps to the range defined by the `Out Low` and `Out High` parameters. The default is `False`.

## Discussion

The `Range` node takes a range of incoming values and converts them to another range. The node also provides the option to apply a gamma correction, which occurs in the middle of the transformation process. The gamma value is the inverse exponent the node applies to the  incoming values. For example, a value of `2` raises the incoming values to the power of `1/2`, effectively calculating the square root. The node also provides the option to clamp the output, which means any values below the `Out Low` parameter are set to the value of `Out Low`, and any values above the `Out High` parameter are set to value of `Out High`.
