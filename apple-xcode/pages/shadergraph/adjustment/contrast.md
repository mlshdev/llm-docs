## Parameter descriptions

- **`In`**: The input value to modify.
- **`Amount`**: The linear slope multiplier that increases or decreases the contrast. A value between `0.0` and `1.0` decreases the contrast of the `In` parameter, while a value greater than `1.0` increases it.
- **`Pivot`**: The center value of the contrast adjustment. As contrast increases, values of the `In` parameter get further away from this value. As contrast decreases, values of the `In` parameter get closer to this value.

## Discussion

Below is an example of a node graph that uses the `Contrast` node to make a black and white arrow texture more gray and closer in color.

Below, the resulting texture applies to a cube:

![](https://developer.apple.com/images/ShaderGraph-Docs/ContrastMaterial.png)

In the image above, the value of `Pivot` is `0.2`, which represents a dark gray. Because the value of `Amount` is also `0.2`, the contrast of the input decreases while the color value of the texture moves closer to the `Pivot` input. As a result, the output texture of the node becomes a gray version of the original black and white arrow texture.
