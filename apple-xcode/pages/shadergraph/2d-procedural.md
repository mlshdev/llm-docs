# 2D-Procedural

**Framework:** ShaderGraph  
**Kind:** ShaderGraph Node Group

Generate 2D gradients, noise, and other patterns programmatically for your material.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Use these nodes to generate gradients, noise, and other types of patterns and apply them to textures or other 2D surfaces. For example, you might use a horizontal or vertical ramp node to create a color gradient on a surface.

## Topics

### Nodes

- [Ramp Horizontal](2d-procedural/ramp-horizontal.md): A left-to-right linear value ramp (gradient) generator.
- [Ramp Vertical](2d-procedural/ramp-vertical.md): A top-to-bottom linear value ramp (gradient) generator.
- [Ramp 4 Corners](2d-procedural/ramp-4-corners.md): A four-point linear value ramp (gradient) generator.
- [Split Horizontal](2d-procedural/split-horizontal.md): A left-to-right split matte, split at a specified U value.
- [Split Vertical](2d-procedural/split-vertical.md): A top-to-bottom split matte, split at a specified V value.
- [Noise 2D](2d-procedural/noise-2d.md): A 2D Perlin noise generator.
- [Cellular Noise 2D](2d-procedural/cellular-noise-2d.md): A 2D cellular noise generator.
- [Worley Noise 2D](2d-procedural/worley-noise-2d.md): A 2D Worley noise generator.
