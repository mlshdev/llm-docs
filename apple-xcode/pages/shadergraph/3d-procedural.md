# 3D-Procedural

**Framework:** ShaderGraph  
**Kind:** ShaderGraph Node Group

Generate 3D noise patterns programmatically for your material.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

3D Procedural nodes generate noise patterns that don’t repeat along the z-axis of your model. Use the nodes to add random variations to parts of your material, such as its surface roughness. Each node produces a different type of noise pattern based on a specific algorithm.

## Topics

### Nodes

- [Noise 3D](3d-procedural/noise-3d.md): A 3D Perlin noise generator.
- [Fractal Noise 3D](3d-procedural/fractal-noise-3d.md): Zero-centered 3D fractal noise created by summing several octaves of 3D Perlin noise.
- [Cellular Noise 3D](3d-procedural/cellular-noise-3d.md): A 3D cellular noise generator.
- [Worley Noise 3D](3d-procedural/worley-noise-3d.md): A 3D Worley noise generator.
