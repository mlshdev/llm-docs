## Parameter descriptions

- **`Position`**: The 3D coordinates at which the data is read in order to map the texture onto a surface. The default is to use the current 3D object-space coordinates.

## Discussion

The `Cellular Noise 3D` shader node procedurally generates noise patterns that you can use to add texture and variation to materials. Because this node generates noise in 3D, the texture doesn’t repeat in the Z direction, but rather continue as depth changes. Below is an example of a node graph that uses the `Cellular Noise 3D` node to generate a black and white pattern procedurally:

Multiply the incoming position with a constant float. The float changes the frequency of the generated noise to a higher number that corresponds with the pattern repeating more often. The output of the node runs through a `Convert` node to change the float output to a black and white color output. Below, the resulting texture applies to a cube:
