## Discussion

The `Clamp` node restricts the range of values of an input as defined by the `Low` and `High` parameters passed into the node. The output of the `Clamp` node is the same as the `In` value if it falls within the defined range. Otherwise, the output clamps to the nearest limit, which is either the `Low` or `High` value. Use the `Clamp` node to create more predictable and controlled shader behavior for materials.
