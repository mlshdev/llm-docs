# Adjustment

**Framework:** ShaderGraph  
**Kind:** ShaderGraph Node Group

Modify or convert values, or ranges of values, from one form to another.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Use Adjustment nodes to adjust color values, convert between different color formats, or map input values to a different set of outputs based on rules you specify. For example, you might use these nodes to adapt the output from one node to match the expected input for another node.

## Topics

### Nodes

- [Remap](adjustment/remap.md): Linearly remaps incoming values from one range to another.
- [Smooth Step](adjustment/smooth-step.md): Outputs a smooth remapping from low-high to 0-1.
- [Luminance](adjustment/luminance.md): Outputs a grayscale value containing the luminance of the incoming RGB color in all color channels.
- [RGB to HSV](adjustment/rgb-to-hsv.md): Converts a color from RGB to HSV space.
- [HSV to RGB](adjustment/hsv-to-rgb.md): Converts a color from HSV to RGB space.
- [Contrast](adjustment/contrast.md): Increases or decreases contrast of values using a linear slope multiplier.
- [Range](adjustment/range.md): Remaps incoming values from one range to another.
- [HSV Adjust](adjustment/hsv-adjust.md): Adjusts the hue, saturation and value of an RGB color by a vector .
- [Saturate](adjustment/saturate.md): Adjusts the saturation of a color.
- [Step (RealityKit)](adjustment/step-%28realitykit%29.md): Outputs a 1 or a 0 depending on whether the input is greater than or less than the edge value.
