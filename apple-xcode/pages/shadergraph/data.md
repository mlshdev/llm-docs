# Data

**Framework:** ShaderGraph  
**Kind:** ShaderGraph Node Group

Convert data values to different formats, or manipulate individual elements within a data structure.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Use data nodes to take one type of data and manipulate it to get a different type of value. Data manipulations can take several forms:

- Convert one data type to a different format.
- Combine individual elements to create a single data type.
- Separate a single data type into its component elements.
- Extract or manipulate individual values from a data structure and use them as input to other nodes.

## Topics

### Nodes

- [Convert](data/convert.md): Converts a stream from one data type to another.
- [Swizzle](data/swizzle.md): Performs an arbitrary permutation of the channels of the input stream, returning a new stream of the specified type.
- [Combine 2](data/combine-2.md): Combines the channels from two streams into two channels of a single output stream of a compatible type.
- [Combine 3](data/combine-3.md): Combines the channels from three streams into three channels of a single output stream of a compatible type.
- [Combine 4](data/combine-4.md): Combines the channels from four streams into four channels of a single output stream of a compatible type.
- [Extract](data/extract.md): Generates a float stream from one channel of a color​N o​r vector​N ​stream.
- [Separate 2](data/separate-2.md): Outputs each of the channels of a vector2 or integer2 as individual float or integer outputs.
- [Separate 3](data/separate-3.md): Outputs each of the channels of a color3, vector3, or integer3 as individual float or integer outputs.
- [Separate 4](data/separate-4.md): Outputs each of the channels of a color4, vector4, or integer4 as individual float or integer outputs.
- [Primvar Reader](data/primvar-reader.md): A node that provides the ability for shading networks to consume data defined on geometry.
