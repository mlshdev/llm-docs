## Overview

The example below stores a dictionary in a [PlaygroundValue](playgroundvalue.md) instance and then stores the value in a [PlaygroundKeyValueStore](playgroundkeyvaluestore.md).

**Listing 1**

```swift
let myData = [
    "animal": PlaygroundValue.string("Llama"),
    "count": PlaygroundValue.integer(5)
]

PlaygroundKeyValueStore.current.keyValueStore["AnimalCountDict"] = .dictionary(myData)
```
