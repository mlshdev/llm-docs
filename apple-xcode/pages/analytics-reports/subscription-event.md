The Subscription Event report includes an aggregated count of subscription lifecycle changes. You can use this report to understand the number of offer starts, offer renewals, conversions to paid, paid renewals, voluntary and involuntary churn, and more. Subscription data in this report is enriched with app download source and referrer information, enabling you to understand which acquisition channels help you acquire subscribers.
