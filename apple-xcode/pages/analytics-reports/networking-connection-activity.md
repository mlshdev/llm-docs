# Networking Connection Activity

**Kind:** Article

Review how your app uses network connections.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

The data in this report contains information about your application’s use of network connections. This includes bytes sent and received, and duration of connections.

- Territories: Worldwide
- Platforms: iOS, iPadOS.  For more information about iOS and iPadOS, see the Platforms section in [Data Completeness and Corrections](data-completeness-corrections.md).
- Availability:

  - Daily: Every day.
- History: On request, data is available beginning with iOS 17.4 and iPadOS 17.4.
- Completeness: Data from devices that contribute to this report can arrive as late as 8 days after the date it generates on device. You can download recent data daily, but it might be incomplete, and data updates incrementally daily, until all late-arriving events are available.
- Privacy:

  - Includes data from users who have opted to share their data with Apple and developers.
  - Individual rows will only appear if they have a value of 5 or more.
- Data Context: You can analyze your data with additional context by comparing it with the data in the [App Sessions Context](app-sessions-context.md) report, which provides a count of unique devices that use your app on a specific day. For example, if your app performed an action detailed in this report on 10 unique devices on a specific day, and the App Sessions Context report shows there were 100 unique devices running your app that day, then you can approximate that 10% of the devices running your app performed that action.
