# Streaming Playback Performance

**Kind:** Article

Review playback performance when using the AVPlayerItem APIs in your apps.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

You can use the [AVPlayerItem](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avplayeritem) API and others in [AVFoundation](https://developer.apple.com/av-foundation) to manage the playback of [HTTP Live Streaming](https://developer.apple.com/streaming) (HLS) media assets in apps. The data in this report contains aggregate information about playback performance.

- Privacy Measures: Data for this report is collected from select 3rd party apps. Each data point in this report comes from at least 200 unique playback sessions. Data points with fewer playback sessions are omitted.
- Data Source: Data in this report only comes from devices that opt in to share data with Apple and developers.
- Historical Data: One-time snapshots for this report are available beginning in February 2024, if there are events for the report.
