# CAMetalLayer Performance

**Kind:** Article

Review CAMetalLayer metadata and performance in your app.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

The data in this report contains metadata and performance information about how your app uses CAMetalLayer.

- Territories: Worldwide
- Platforms: iOS, iPadOS.  For more information about iOS and iPadOS, see the Platforms section in [Data Completeness and Corrections](data-completeness-corrections.md).
- Availability:

  - Daily: Every day.
- History: On request, data is available beginning with iOS 17.4 and iPadOS 17.4.
- Completeness: Data from devices that contribute to this report can arrive as late as 8 days after the date it generates on device. You can download recent data daily, but it might be incomplete, and data updates incrementally daily, until all late-arriving events are available.
- Privacy:

  - Includes data from users who have opted to share their data with Apple and developers.
  - Individual rows will only appear if they have a value of 5 or more.
- Data Context: You can analyze your data with additional context by comparing it with the data in the [App Sessions Context](app-sessions-context.md) report, which provides a count of unique devices that use your app on a specific day. For example, if your app performed an action detailed in this report on 10 unique devices on a specific day, and the App Sessions Context report shows there were 100 unique devices running your app that day, then you can approximate that 10% of the devices running your app performed that action.

## Report Fields

| Report Field | Description | Data Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Count | Number of times the event occurred | `integer` |
| Territory | Country or region in which the event occurred | `string` |
| Date | Date when the event occurred | `string` |
| Platform | OS version on the device on which the event occurred | `string` |
| Device | Type of device on which the event occurred | `string` |
| Build | Build of device on which event occurred | `string` |
| Unique Devices | The count of unique devices | `integer` |
| Release Type | Type of software release | `string` |
| Bundle Short Version | The short bundle version of the client process. | `string` |
| App Version | Version of the app associated with the event | `string` |
| Layer Name | The name of the layer (if known). | `string` |
| Process Name | The name of the CAMetalLayer client process. | `string` |
| Active Duration | The amount of time, in seconds, that the most active layer in the CAMetalLayer client session actively generates new on-screen content. | `float` |
| Average Height | The average height, in pixels, of the chosen CAMetalLayer over the course of the session. | `float` |
| Average Width | The average width, in pixels, of the chosen CAMetalLayer over the course of the session. | `float` |
| Client Lifetime Duration | The number of seconds the client process existed (estimated). | `float` |
| Lifetime Active Layer Count | The total number of layers observed during the client’s lifetime. | `integer` |
| Presented Frame Command Buffer Count | The number of command buffers associated with presented frames of the chosen CAMetalLayer. | `integer` |
| Presented Frame Count | The number of presented frames, as determined by counting presented CAMetalDrawables of the chosen CAMetalLayer. | `integer` |
| Skipped Frame Count | The number of skipped frames, for example, CAMetalDrawables created but not put on glass. | `integer` |
| Total Presented Drawables Count | The total presented CAMetalDrawables across all CAMetalLayers of the client process, not just the most active CAMetalLayer. This approximates the proportion of the CAMetalDrawables reported. | `integer` |
| On Glass Present Lateness Count | The count of frames that arrived late on glass. | `integer` |
| Presented CPU End-To-End Drawable Total | The total end-to-end CPU walltime, in milliseconds, for all CAMetalDrawables for the chosen layer during the client’s lifetime. | `float` |
| Presented On GPU Walltime Total | The total on-GPU walltime, in milliseconds, attributed to CAMetalDrawables for the chosen layer during the client’s lifetime. | `float` |
| On Glass Present Lateness Total | The total estimated on-glass presentation lateness, in milliseconds, for drawables for the chosen layer during the lifetime of the client process. | `float` |
| Presented GPU End-To-End Drawable Total | The total end-to-end GPU walltime, in milliseconds, for all CAMetalDrawables for the chosen layer during the client’s lifetime. | `float` |
| Presented GPU Done-To-Completed Total | The total amount of time, in milliseconds, spent waiting for drawables to land on glass after GPU work completion from the selected CAMetalLayer. | `float` |
| On Glass Interval Total | The total on-glass interval, in milliseconds, for CAMetalDrawables from the selected CAMetalLayer. | `float` |
| On Glass Interval Count | The total number of on-glass frame (CAMetalDrawables) intervals for the given CAMetalLayer. | `integer` |
