## Discussion

Scripting Bridge uses this method to communicate with target applications. If the target application responds to this method by sending an Apple event representing an error, the receiver calls its delegate’s [eventDidFail:withError:](../sbapplicationdelegate/eventdidfail%28__witherror_%29.md) method. If no delegate has been assigned, the receiver raises an exception.

You should rarely have to call this method directly.
