# Asynchronous Tests and Expectations (Swift)

**Framework:** XCTest  
**Kind:** API Collection

Verify that asynchronous code behaves as expected.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Asynchronous code doesn’t execute directly within the current flow of code. This might be because the code runs on a different thread or dispatch queue, in a delegate method, or in a callback, or because it’s a Swift function marked with `async`.

`XCTest` provides two approaches for testing asynchronous code. For Swift code that uses `async` and `await` for concurrency, you mark your test methods `async` or `async` `throws` to test asynchronously. For any other types of asynchronous code, within your test you create one or more *expectations*, which are objects that XCTest uses to handle waiting. Then you *fulfill* those expectations when the asynchronous code finishes running to tell XCTest to stop waiting. Your test method waits until all expectations are fulfilled or a specified timeout expires.

### Build Asynchronous Tests with Swift Concurrency

To test Swift code that uses `async` and `await` for concurrency, mark your test method `async` or `async` `throws`. `XCTest` executes your test method asynchronously so that your test waits until `async` calls complete.

```swift
func testDownloadWebDataWithConcurrency() async throws {
    // Create a URL for a webpage to download.
    let url = URL(string: "https://apple.com")!
    
    // Use an asynchronous function to download the webpage.
    let dataAndResponse: (data: Data, response: URLResponse) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url, delegate: nil)
    
    // Assert that the actual response matches the expected response.
    let httpResponse = try XCTUnwrap(dataAndResponse.response as? HTTPURLResponse, "Expected an HTTPURLResponse.")
    XCTAssertEqual(httpResponse.statusCode, 200, "Expected a 200 OK response.")
}
```

When the asynchronous task completes, perform assertions to confirm that the task’s actual results meet your expected results.

If your test encounters a thrown error, `XCTest` records a test failure.

> **Important**

>  If your test code needs to run on the Main actor, specify `@MainActor` for your test method or class. If you don’t specify an actor, the test method executes on an arbitrary actor.

### Build Asynchronous Tests with Expectations

When you can’t use Swift `async`, use expectations to test asynchronous code. For example, use expectations when there isn’t a Swift `async` alternative available or when your asynchronous code runs in:

- Objective-C
- An asynchronous block in a dispatch queue
- A delegate method
- An asynchronous callback, closure, or completion block
- A `Future` or `Promise` in Swift Combine
- A situation where it needs to complete within a specific amount of time

Before you perform an asynchronous task in your test method, create an instance of [XCTestExpectation](xctestexpectation.md) with a description of the task.

```swift
// Create an expectation for an asynchronous task.
let expectation = XCTestExpectation(description: "Open a file asynchronously.")
```

Start the asynchronous task, and then tell the test to wait for the expectation to complete within an amount of time you specify.

```swift
let fileManager = ExampleFileManager()

// Perform the asynchronous task.
fileManager.openFileAsync(with: "exampleFilename") { file, error in
    //...
}

// Wait for the expectation to fulfill or time out.
wait(for: [expectation], timeout: 10.0)
```

When the asynchronous task returns (for example, in a callback), perform assertions to confirm that the task’s actual results meet your expected results. When the task completes, call the [fulfill()](xctestexpectation/fulfill%28%29.md) method on the expectation to indicate to the test that it can stop waiting and proceed with the next test.

```swift
fileManager.openFileAsync(with: "exampleFilename") { file, error in

    // Assert that the asynchronous task worked.
    XCTAssertNotNil(file, "Expected to load a file.")

    // Assert that no errors occurred opening the file asynchronously.
    XCTAssertNil(error, "Expected no errors loading a file.")
    
    // Fulfill the expectation.
    expectation.fulfill()
}

```

If the test doesn’t execute the `fulfill()` method before the wait statement’s timeout expires, `XCTest` records a test failure.

## Topics

### Expectations

- [XCTestExpectation](xctestexpectation.md): An expected outcome in an asynchronous test.

### Key Value Observing Expectations

- [XCTKVOExpectation](xctkvoexpectation.md): Deprecated. An expectation that a specific key-value observing (KVO) condition fulfills.
- [XCTKeyPathExpectation](xctkeypathexpectation.md): An expectation that a specific key-value observing (KVO) condition fulfills.

### Notification-Based Expectations

- [XCTNSNotificationExpectation](xctnsnotificationexpectation.md): An expectation that is fulfilled when an expected `NSNotification` is received.
- [XCTDarwinNotificationExpectation](xctdarwinnotificationexpectation.md): An expectation that is fulfilled when an expected Darwin notification is received.

### Predicate-Based Expectations

- [XCTNSPredicateExpectation](xctnspredicateexpectation.md): An expectation that’s fulfilled when an `NSPredicate` is satisfied.

### Expectation Waiters

- [XCTWaiter](xctwaiter.md): Waits for the fulfillment of a group of expectations.
