## Discussion

Run a block of code as a named substep in a test. For more information, see [Grouping Tests into Substeps with Activities](../grouping-tests-into-substeps-with-activities.md).

To save screenshots or other test-result data for later investigation, call the [add(\_:)](../xctactivity/add%28__%29.md) method on the instance of [XCTActivity](../xctactivity.md) that the test system passes to your block. For more information, see [Adding Attachments to Tests, Activities, and Issues](../adding-attachments-to-tests-activities-and-issues.md).
