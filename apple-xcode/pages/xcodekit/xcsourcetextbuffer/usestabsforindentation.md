# usesTabsForIndentation (Swift)

**Framework:** XcodeKit

## Declaration

```

## Discussion

The `usesTabsForIndentation` property determines whether tab characters are used to indent text instead of space characters when possible. When the indentation width isn’t a multiple of the tab width, space characters are used to pad the indentation to the appropriate width.

For example, consider an `XCSourceTextBuffer` instance that has a tab width of eight, an indentation width of four, and the `usesTabsForIndentation` property set to `true`. The first indentation level is represented by four space characters, the second by a tab character, the third by a tab followed by four space characters, the fourth by two tab characters, and so on.
