<a id="General"></a>

### General

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: The scheme action toolbar button now treats ‘without building’ variants, obtained by holding the Control key, as a one-shot operation and reverts to the normal build-then-perform action when no modifiers are used. (12239704)
- Fixed: If you installed Xcode 27 beta on macOS Tahoe 26.5.1 and earlier, macOS virtual machine installation will fail due to a known bug. To restore virtual machine installation functionality, follow the [How to reinstall macOS guide](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102655). (179068335)
- Fixed: Devices used for development on a Mac without Xcode 27 installed remain compatible for development on Macs which have not upgraded to Xcode 27 without needing to reboot. (179359489) (FB23066098)

<a id="Address-Sanitizer"></a>

### Address Sanitizer

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- Address Sanitizer might fail to launch on iOS 27.0, tvOS 27.0, watchOS 27.0, and visionOS 27.0 when building with Xcode 26.4 or older. (178072780)

  **Workaround:** Use Xcode 26.5 or later when testing applications with Address Sanitizer.

<a id="App-Intents"></a>

   - Name: MyTag
     Methods:
     - Name: operator+
       Availability: none
  ```

  (148534260)

<a id="Background-Assets"></a>

### Background Assets

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- Asset-pack manifests now support path wildcards, file exclusion, hard-coded source roots, and custom destination subpaths. (163943159)
- You can reduce your app’s storage usage with localized asset packs. The system delivers the appropriately localized asset packs based on the user’s preferred languages. (163944365)
- Use the new Steam Asset Converter to convert your Steam “depots” into asset packs. (163953178)
- Xcode can now serve asset packs to your app while debugging on devices by setting a Background Asset Packs folder in the Run scheme action’s Options tab. (165230494)

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: The packaging tool, ba-package, may generate an invalid asset-pack archive when you specify an on-demand download policy. (179168553) (FB23020247)

<a id="C++-Standard-Library"></a>

### C++ Standard Library

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- The following C++ papers have been implemented:

  - Hashing support for `std::chrono` value classes ([P2592R3](https://wg21.link/P2592R3))
  - `zip` ([P2321R2](https://wg21.link/P2321R2))
  - `std::optional<T&>` ([P2988R12](https://wg21.link/P2988R12))
  - sub-`string_view` from `string` ([P3044R2](https://wg21.link/P3044R2))
  - Making `std::istream::ignore` less surprising ([P3223R2](https://wg21.link/P3223R2))
  - Add `std::views::indices(n)` ([P3060R3](https://wg21.link/P3060R3))
  - Move-only types for `equality_comparable_with`, `totally_ordered_with`, and `three_way_comparable_with` ([P2404R3](https://wg21.link/P2404R3))
  - Checking if a `union` alternative is active ([P2641R4](https://wg21.link/P2641R4)(`std::is_within_lifetime`))
  - Expose `std::atomic_ref`’s object address ([P2835R7](https://wg21.link/P2835R7))
  - Comparisons for `reference_wrapper` ([P2944R3](https://wg21.link/P2944R3))
  - Give `std::optional` Range Support (guarded by `-fexperimental-library`) ([P3168R2](https://wg21.link/P3168R2))
  - Fixes to `flat_map` and `flat_set` ([P3567R2](https://wg21.link/P3567R2))
  - Make `optional<T&>` trivially copyable ([P3836R2](https://wg21.link/P3836R2))
  - Library Support for Expansion Statements ([P1789R3](https://wg21.link/P1789R3))

  Performance improvements:

  - The performance of associative and unordered containers has been significantly improved, with some functions showing improvement of up to 11x.
  - The performance of many algorithms has been improved (including `std::find`, `std::for_each`|`ranges::for_each` for associative containers, `std::rotate`), resulting in a performance improvement of up to 3x.
  - `{std,ranges}::{generate, generate_n}`, `{std,ranges}::{fill, fill_n}` and `{std,ranges}::distance` have been specifically optimized for segmented iterators, resulting in a performance improvement of up to 10x (and even up to 1600x for `distance` on non-random-access iterators).
  - `std::search_n` for random access iterators now tries to skip elements, resulting in a significant performance improvement (up to 70,000x in contrived cases).
  - The `vector<bool>::reserve()` algorithm has been optimized, resulting in a performance improvement of up to 2x.
  - `num_get::do_get` integral overloads have been optimized, resulting in a performance improvement of up to 2.8x.
  - Some reallocations are now avoided in `std::filesystem::path::lexically_relative`, resulting in a performance improvement of up to 1.7x.
  - `ofstream::write` now passes large strings to system calls directly instead of copying them in chunks into a buffer.

  Miscellaneous improvements:

  - Multiple internal types have been refactored to use `[[no_unique_address]]`, resulting in faster compile times and reduced debug information.
  - `std::align` is now an inline function, which allows the compiler to better optimize calls to it.
  - `std::atomic::wait` has been refactored to accept more types to use platform native wait functions directly. This is guarded behind the ABI Macro `_LIBCPP_ABI_ATOMIC_WAIT_NATIVE_BY_SIZE`. (178191000)

<a id="Deprecations"></a>

#### Deprecations

- The following items have been deprecated or removed:

  - The minimum supported deployment target on macOS for the C++ standard library has been increased to 11.0.

  Potentially breaking changes:

  - The algorithm for `multi{map,set}::find` has been modified so that it doesn’t necessarily return an iterator to the first equal element in the container. This was never guaranteed by the Standard, but libc++ previously happened to always return the first equal element. Starting with this release, code relying on the first element being returned from `find` will be broken, and `lower_bound` or `equal_range` should be used instead.
  - The algorithms for `std::{map,set}` `lower_bound` and `upper_bound` operations were modified so that their result changed for comparators that are not a strict weak order. Being a strict weak order was always a requirement of the Standard and still is, however in this release libc++ changes the behavior of `std::{map,set}` for such comparators. Since this may be tricky to work around in some cases, an escape hatch is provided in this release: defining `_LIBCPP_ENABLE_LEGACY_TREE_LOWER_UPPER_BOUND` will revert to the historical implementation of these operations. That escape hatch will be removed in an upcoming release (likely in the next release).
  - The ABI flag `_LIBCPP_ABI_NO_REVERSE_ITERATOR_SECOND_MEMBER` has been split off from `_LIBCPP_ABI_NO_ITERATOR_BASES`. If you are using this flag and require ABI stability, you should set `_LIBCPP_ABI_NO_REVERSE_ITERATOR_SECOND_MEMBER` as well.

  ABI-affecting changes:

  - The ABI flag `_LIBCPP_ABI_NO_REVERSE_ITERATOR_SECOND_MEMBER` has been split off from `_LIBCPP_ABI_NO_ITERATOR_BASES`. If you are using this flag and require ABI stability, you should set `_LIBCPP_ABI_NO_REVERSE_ITERATOR_SECOND_MEMBER` as well.
  - The internal types `__map_value_compare`, `__unordered_map_hasher`, `__unordered_map_equal`, `__hash_map_hasher` and `__hash_map_equal` have been refactored to use `_LIBCPP_COMPRESSED_ELEMENT` instead of potentially inheriting from the types they wrap. At this point in time we are not aware of any ABI changes caused by this.
  - `ranges::iota_view` is now aware of `__int128`. This causes `iota_view::difference_type` to change from `long long` to `__int128` in some cases.
  - `std::allocator` is now trivially default-constructible. The behavior can be reverted by defining `_LIBCPP_DEPRECATED_ABI_NON_TRIVIAL_ALLOCATOR`. This compatibility macro is going to be removed in an upcoming release.
  - `bitset::operator[]` now returns `bool`, making libc++ conform to the Standard. The behavior can be reverted by defining `_LIBCPP_DEPRECATED_ABI_BITSET_CONST_SUBSCRIPT_RETURN_REF`. This compatibility macro is going to be removed in an upcoming release. (178191050)

<a id="CarPlay-Simulator"></a>

### CarPlay Simulator

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: Cannot start a CarPlay connection with CarPlay Simulator when accessed via Device Hub. (179523697)

<a id="Coding-Intelligence"></a>

### Coding Intelligence

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- Google Gemini is now available in the coding assistant. (171990272)
- Planning with agents is now first class in Xcode. Plans appear as editable Markdown artifacts next to the conversation. You can use dedicated UI to review, annotate, discuss changes to the plan, and approve before the agent proceeds. (172857081)
- The Coding Assistant sidebar is now dedicated to displaying and organizing your conversations with real-time status and unread indicators, drag-and-drop grouping, archiving, and renaming. See at a glance which conversations are active or waiting for user input, and jump between them without losing context. Select multiple conversations to group, archive, or delete them in bulk. The context menu allows for opening conversations in new tabs, windows, or editor panes. (172926345)
- The Preview Snapshot MCP tool can now render variants such as light/dark appearance, portrait/landscape orientation, and various type size overrides. It also supports specifying timelines for Widgets and toggle states for Live Activities. Taken together, this gives agents more flexibility in how they render previews in your codebase. (172961797)
- Agents can now boot simulators, install and launch apps, synthesize touch events, and capture screenshots to verify UI behavior. (175179787)
- Added new MCP tools to read, plan, and edit translations in String Catalog files. (176376425)
- The toolbar now has a “New Conversation” button that lets you start a fresh conversation from anywhere in Xcode. When conversations are active, it shows a status indicator for easy monitoring at a glance. Click the status indicator to jump directly to the next conversation that needs attention. (176385678)
- The Xcode MCP server has been updated with new tools that allow agents to debug projects by manipulating the active run state, interacting with and reading the contents of the debugger console; listing and switching between available schemes and run destinations and inspecting and modifying build settings, compiler flags, entitlements, and Info.plist keys. (176935844)
- The Preview Snapshot MCP tool now returns information about the platform, device type, and operating system version of the Simulator that rendered the preview. (177076406)
- Agents in Xcode now have access to insights about your projects, such as crashes, disk writes, energy, hangs and launch issues impacting your app, helping reduce the time it takes to ship a fix. (177568662)
- The coding assistant has moved out of the navigator into the editor area, with a completely redesigned conversation transcript. Agent-generated artifacts, like code diffs, plans, and SwiftUI preview snapshots, appear alongside the transcript, and annotations on code snippets and plan documents let you give targeted inline feedback without leaving context. (178288550)
- Xcode now ships with Apple-built specialists for targeted tasks, like localization, UIKit resizing and accessibility. (178289150)
- Agents in Xcode can now be extended with plugins that contain skills, MCP servers, and ACP agent configurations. Skills are invokable as slash commands with completion support. (178289210)
- Coding Intelligence now includes a new security layer that monitors and controls filesystem access by coding agents and any processes they spawn. This can be enabled in Coding Intelligence settings. (178289431)
- Xcode adds support for the Agent Client protocol. (178294840)
- Agent Plug-ins can show custom icons and tool names for MCP servers they define by adding additional \_meta fields to their JSON definitions.

  ```
   {
     "name": "MyGreatPlugin",
     "description": "An awesome MCP server configuration.",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "mcpServers": {
       "MyGreatMCP": {
         "type": "http",
         "url": "...",
         "tools": [
           "*"
         ],
         "_meta": {
           "ideToolIconPath": "./icon.svg",
           "ideToolIconRendersAsTemplate": true,
           "ideToolTitles": {
             "whoami": "Who Am I",
                   "get-current-email": "Get Current Email Message" 
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }
  ```

  (178470032)
- Xcode build and test MCP tools now send dynamic activity status instead of static text to external MCP clients. (181078347)
- Coding Intelligence agents can now verify watchOS apps, including rotating and pressing the Digital Crown, and pressing the side and Action buttons (Apple Watch Ultra). (181147968)
- Xcode 27 Beta 5 adds a preview of a new MCP server experience that runs without requiring an open Xcode workspace. This new experience also allows you to grant code-signed agents permission to use projects within a directory tree for extended periods of time without being asked for additional permissions.

  You can turn this experience on by using `sudo xcrun mcp-server enable`. Check its state afterward with `xcrun mcp-server status`.

  Developers running agents in unattended environments can approve all permissions upfront with `sudo xcrun mcp-server enable --unsafe-always-allow-all-agents`. This is not a recommended configuration for at-desk use.

  In this early preview, some aspects of the `xcrun mcp-server` command line utility may not work in all configurations, and some settings or permissions may occasionally require relaunching Xcode or rebooting your machine to apply. (181836944)
- Google Antigravity is now available in the coding assistant. (183074664)
- Coding Intelligence agents can now verify tvOS apps, navigating with the Siri Remote to move focus, select, and go Home, and entering text into focused fields. (183317784)

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: Buttons in the Coding Assistant’s prompt area now use more accessible labels and descriptions. (177462284)
- Fixed VoiceOver getting trapped in the Coding Assistant prompt area. (177462397)
- Fixed: If the plan-mode confirmation bar (“Implement the plan?” with Yes/No buttons) appears while the agent is still streaming a response, clicking either button may trigger a new agent turn on top of the in-flight one, leaving the conversation in an inconsistent state. (178673449)
- Fixed: ACP agents added as part of agent plug-ins may not be removed from Xcode’s UI until relaunching Xcode. (178771195)
- Fixed: If a deep link targeting the new beta is invoked on a system where an older version is set as the active developer tool, the link will be claimed by the older installation rather than the beta. (179126594)
- Fixed: Apple-authored agent skills may not be available to Codex. (179171480)
- Fixed: The Coding Assistant artifact view shows preview snapshots from all turns even when the Scope filter is set to Last Turn. (185119267)
- Fixed: In some cases, connected projects may not appear in the Xcode Service menu bar extra panel. (185161968)

<a id="Console"></a>

### Console

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: Console may fail to scroll fully to the bottom while output is streaming. (175800015)

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- When streaming `stdout` and `stderr` from multiple processes at the same time (for example: in parallel testing scenarios), the results may be significantly delayed. (165098287)

<a id="Core-AI"></a>

### Core AI

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: The option to extract inputs from prediction events in the Core AI gauge in Xcode may not work reliably. (172502576)
- Fixed: The number of parameters displayed in the Core AI model view in Xcode is inaccurate for models with multiple functions that share parameters. (177784390)
- Fixed: When Metal API Validation is enabled, CoreAI models might fail to execute. (177991751)

<a id="Core-ML"></a>

### Core ML

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: Nested MLPackage bundles might cause Xcode to hang. (184876764) (FB24320785)

<a id="Debugging"></a>

### Debugging

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- In projects using bridging headers, LLDB can now directly import explicitly built Swift modules and PCH from DerivedData. This can dramatically speed up the first expression or `po` in a debug session involving a bridging header. (168272248)
- LLDB now provides a `language swift task tree` command, which prints a tree of all the Swift Tasks the debugger knows about. For more information, see the output of `help language swift task tree`. (169471480)
- LLDB can now inspect data types with ~Copyable fields in the standard library and other system frameworks. (176282041)
- LLDB now ships with an MCP server (lldb-mcp). See [Model Context Protocol](https://lldb.llvm.org/use/mcp.html) for examples. (176901842)

<a id="Developer-Documentation"></a>

### Developer Documentation

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- You can now use natural language to search the developer documentation. Matching documents are returned based on semantic matching. (165476491)

<a id="Device-Hub"></a>

### Device Hub

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- Common Mac mouse and trackpad gestures such as scrolling, pinching, and rotating now work with standard UIKit components on iOS devices, either physical or simulated. When scrolling with a pointing device, `UIEvent.EventType.scroll` is emitted. When pinching or rotating with a trackpad, `UIEvent.EventType.transform` is emitted. As a result of these pointer-based events being emitted, you may see `UIPointerInteraction` effects applied based on where the pointer is located in your app. Additionally, clicking with a mouse or trackpad produces a simulated finger touch of type `UITouch.TouchType.direct` rather than `UITouch.TouchType.indirectPointer`. This hybrid behavior has been added for ease of use for Device Hub, and does not reflect functionality available on physical devices. To validate your app’s full pointer behavior, select “Simulate Trackpad or Mouse” from the Device menu, test on a physical iPad with a paired pointing device, or use iPhone Mirroring. (48372360) (FB5341466)
- Device Hub adds a new way to pair iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch running iOS 27/iPadOS 27/watchOS 27 and later over a network.

  This allows you to pair iPhones and iPads without requiring a cable, and provides a more reliable experience for pairing watches.

  To get started, click the + button in Device Hub’s sidebar then select “Pair Nearby Device…”, or refer to the documentation at [Managing your simulated and physical devices in Device Hub](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/managing-your-simulated-and-physical-devices-in-device-hub). (179418483)
- A device’s UUID is now shown by default in the Info Inspector under ‘Hardware Properties’. (183547490)
- To reduce confusion with other unique identifiers, the CoreDevice ID is no longer shown by default in the Info Inspector. You can use the ‘Edit Visibility’ button at the bottom of the Info inspector to make the CoreDevice ID visible. (183763393)

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: The ‘VoiceOver’ toggle in the appearance settings inspector does not enable voiceover on the device. (173507341)
- Fixed: The “Text Size” in the appearance inspector disappears if one of larger text sizes from Accessibility is being used. (175365925)
- Fixed: The “Simulate Hardware Keyboard” menu item does not work correctly. The behavior depends on the mode selected in Settings for “Multitasking & Gestures”. With “Full Screen Apps” selected the mini-keyboard appears; with either of the other two modes, “Windowed Apps” and “Stage Manager”, it doesn’t appear. Simulators select “Windowed Apps” by default. (178196115)
- Fixed: Renaming a device in Device Hub may cut off the renaming prematurely. (178477422)
- Fixed: Renaming a device now works properly if the sidebar is not visible. (178538834)
- Fixed: After switching to Device Hub’s compact view, a visionOS simulator may show a black screen until Device Hub is relaunched. (178567811)
- Fixed: In some circumstances, when using “Simulate Mouse or Trackpad” with an iPad, physical or simulated, the mouse pointer can appear at a different place on the screen than the Mac pointer. (178575823)
- Fixed: The ‘Color Filter’ option in the appearance settings inspector works for simulators. (178854926)
- Fixed: Added a preference to control whether key combos are sent to Device Hub or to the remote device.

  ```
   defaults -container com.apple.dt.Devices write com.apple.dt.Devices hostKeybindingPolicy -int <value>
  ```

  Use these values to define a specific behavior:

  - 0 - Device Hub uses rich key combo shortcuts.
  - 1 - Minimized when interacting with device.
  - 2 - Device Hub uses minimal key combo shortcuts. (178920247)
- Fixed: Due to a timing issue with the installation package, Simulator devices may not appear in Device Hub. (179040327) (FB22978070)
- Fixed: When pasteboard data takes longer than 5s to transfer (e.g., misbehaving apps serving data, data taking a long time to process, or large data taking a long time to transfer), resolution will now only block apps attempting to paste for up to 5s.  After the 5s timeout, the paste will fail but data will continue to be transferred in the background such that the paste can be retried and will succeed after the data has been transferred. (179132581)
- Fixed: Improved reliability of pasteboard synchronization. (179200521)
- Fixed: Device Hub synchronization no longer attempts to synchronize pasteboard data provided by Universal Clipboard. (179287395)
- Fixed: If the user specified a location to save screenshots from Simulator, Device Hub will honor that location before falling back to the global default screenshot location.

  Preference order:

  `com.apple.dt.devices` screenCaptureLocation

  `com.apple.iphonesimulator` ScreenShotSaveLocation

  `com.apple.screencapture` location (179402694)
- Fixed: Device Hub allows you to enter resize mode with an app linked against an iOS 26 or earlier SDK, which is unsupported and may result in Device Hub showing a black screen for the device. (179416769)
- Fixed: If you exit Device Hub’s resize mode through means other than the toolbar button or menu item (e.g. if your resized app crashes or is backgrounded) the device’s screen content will be incorrectly sized until it is rebooted. (179991750)
- Fixed: visionOS simulator takes longer to boot than expected and may stall when deploying an app. (180078336)
- Fixed: When an iPad connects to Device Hub without viewing the screen while the software keyboard is on screen, it can disappear. (181166904)

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- Connecting a game controller to a simulator or device is only supported for the visionOS simulator. (109362811)
- Viewing the video from, or sending inputs to, a physical Apple Vision Pro is not supported in Device Hub 27. All other Device Hub features, like changing settings, DeviceFS, and so forth, are supported. (142582218)

  **Workaround:** Use AirPlay from the Apple Vision Pro to view the video remotely.
- Device Hub doesn’t currently support sending a two-finger touch to a device or simulator. (169537162)
- The Controls-\>Shake menu item does not work. (171282777)
- Sound Output and Input for simulators cannot be set to None. (175714711)
- Device Hub.app downloads app data containers to a folder named with the bundle identifier of the app instead of .xcappdata. (176313137)

  **Workaround:** To make a .xcappdata bundle for use in Xcode’s Run scheme action do the following. Add `.xcappdata` to the folder created by Device Hub when downloading app data containers. Inside that folder make a new folder named AppData. Move the other content in that folder into AppData. For example,

  ```
   com.example.MyApp/{Documents,Library,tmp}
  ```

  becomes:

  ```
   com.example.MyApp.xcappdata/AppData/{Documents,Library,tmp}
  ```
- When the tab bar is visible, controls at the very top of the inspector might not respond to clicks. (176507876)
- When running parallel testing in simulators, devices may not be visible in Device Hub but are still actively running tests. (176809181)

  **Workaround:** Disable parallelized test runs if you want to watch UI tests executing in simulators.
- When a color filter is set on a physical device, the filter is not visible in Device Hub. (178121876)
- With iPad Simulators running iOS 27.0, the “Toggle Software Keyboard” menu item does not work. (178432770)
- With Apple Watch - simulator or physical - scrolling with the mouse pointer over the watch face does not emulate rotating the digital crown. (179079031) (FB22992052)

  **Workaround:** Move the pointer over the crown in the device bezel.
- Keyboard and mouse inputs to simulators for OS versions before iOS 18.0, tvOS 18.0, watchOS 11.0, and visionOS 2.0 are not accepted. (181945323)
- After disconnecting a physical device from Device Hub when “Simulate Hardware Keyboard” was in use, the device may remain in “hardware keyboard” mode for up to 2 minutes. This will cause the software keyboard to not appear when selecting a text field. (182553164)

  **Workaround:** Wait 2 minutes for the condition to clear.

<a id="Deprecations"></a>

#### Deprecations

- Input interactions such as keyboard or pointer are only supported on the following OS versions and newer: macOS 15.0, iOS 18.0, tvOS 18.0, watchOS 11.0, visionOS 2.0. (160482487)

<a id="devicectl"></a>

### devicectl

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- –json-output now fully supports passing JSON output to stdout. See devicectl –help for more details. (63583278)
- As of JSON version 5, devicectl now adds a ‘\_deprecationNotice’ field to any JSON result that contains deprecated properties. Here is the deprecation notice shown for the JSON for device details:

  ```
   "_deprecationNotice" : { 
       "deprecatedFields" : [ 
           "hardwareProperties", 
           "deviceProperties",

<a id="Instruments"></a>

### Instruments

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- `xctrace record` allows you to pass recording options for Instruments from within the CLI. Use `--show-recording-options` to print available options for a template or instrument as a JSON. Pass a modified JSON file with customized options using `--recording-options <json path>`. (47649405) (FB5336460)
- Summary views in Instruments allows you to select multiple rows and copy the content. (50558735)
- Instruments no longer rescales graphs to reflect the local maximum when the visible timeline region changes to simplify comparison of data across the tracks. To trigger manual rescaling to the current viewport, use View → Rescale menu item. (60970746)
- Instruments now restores pinned tracks from the previous run when recording a new run. You can also save and restore pinned tracks explicitly using View → Track States menu actions. (69098114)
- System Trace now unifies system calls, VM faults, and thread states into a single plot. When zoomed out, a new blending algorithm summarizes activity so dense regions remain readable. You can follow the chain of scheduling events for a thread using left/right key navigation. The inspector panel shows details about each event, providing quick actions like pinning a thread that made another thread runnable. (163589543)
- Foundation Models Instrument now helps you trace and debug Foundation Models usage in your app with quick inspection of instructions, prompts, responses, token usage, and inference performance. (164223804)
- A new inspector displays information about the selected event and provides quick actions for pinning or filtering tracks and filtering the detail view. (165724281)
- Swift Concurrency: Tasks, Collections, Actors and Executors now have a detail option “Profile” which displays Call Tree made of profiling data captured while in state Running. This detail is only visible when recording with the Swift Concurrency instrument alongside Time Profiler or CPU Profiler. (168542912)
- When recording os_log Instrument together with an Instrument that creates process or thread tracks (like Time Profiler, CPU Profiler, or others), you can now overlay logging information on these tracks by enabling “os_log” graph in the “Track Graph Display” popover. (170113899)
- A new Swift Executors instrument is now available. It displays tracks for the Cooperative Thread Pool, the Main Actor, and any types conforming to TaskExecutor or SerialExecutor. Instruments properly captures and displays on iOS 27, iPadOS 27, macOS 27, tvOS 27, watchOS 27, visionOS 27. On older systems, executor names fall back to “Unknown executor”. (171189428)
- Swift Concurrency Task tracks now appear in new “Swift Task Collection” tracks. Instruments sorts Tasks into Collections based on their name or place of creation. You can switch Collection tracks between displaying task lifetimes and task states. (173885662)

- SwiftUI instrument adds a “Summary of Updates” focus action to the View Hierarchy detail view that makes it easier to see details about what updates a view in the view hierarchy is performing. (147328805)
- Allocations instrument now visualizes tagged allocations when a process is running with Memory Integrity Enforcement with a ‘(tagged)’ suffix.  ‘Statistics’ view contains opt-in columns to view the count and total size of these allocations in aggregate. (149409607)
- States annotated with the StateReporting API are visible in Instruments as part of the Points of Interest instrument track. Expand top level track to inspect all captured domains and state transitions. (159709795)
- The SwiftUI instrument now records additional information about layout passes and the reasons a layout computation wasn’t cached. (162137231)
- Animation Hitches instrument now supports visionOS on devices running visionOS 27.0 or later. (163315840)
- You can now drag and drop files such as `.atrc`, `.logarchive`, or `.sample` onto the Instruments sidebar. This action creates a run for each of the imported files. (167697855)
- The interface to enable and disable graphs on tracks in the Instruments timeline now uses checkboxes to quickly toggle graph visibility on or off. (168232126)
- Swift Concurrency: When recording all processes, Tasks and Executors are now grouped in process hierarchies. (168542643)
- Swift Concurrency: Selecting a bar chart interval in an Actor or Executor Queue plot now displays the list of waiting tasks in the Inspector. Tasks enqueued before the trace started aren’t displayed. (169113107)
- You can now pin threads displayed in call tree views using the context menu. (169208779)
- os_signpost Instrument now displays a track for each signpost name, nested below the category level in the track hierarchy. (170272998)
- Swift Concurrency Tasks and Actors are now displayed even if their lifetime began before the trace. Instruments makes a best effort to display as much data as possible. Tasks now can have “Unknown” state. Tasks and Actors names may depend on order of incoming data. (171187553)
- `xctrace export` allows you to restrict time range of an export using `time-start`, `time-end`, `duration` arguments. (171320057)
- When you open a `.tracetemplate` file that isn’t saved in the Instruments user templates folder, the template is now copied into that location and subsequently accessible in the “User” tab. (172516226)
- Thread Activity Instrument now displays Quality of Service of individual threads. Effective QoS is displayed by default, Requested QoS is hidden by default (use the track dropdown menu of Thread items in order to reveal it). (173043672)
- System Trace template now graphs thread priority over time to help you understand issues related to resource starvation. (173463486)
- `xctrace export` of traces containing Allocations Instrument now contains a backtrace for each row element in the ‘Allocations List’ detail. Backtraces appear only when captured in the trace data. (173791067)
- The View menu has been reordered to clarify the function of each menu item. (177008275)
- Runs and Comparisons can now be bulk-deleted by using multi-selection and the `Delete` menu item or context menu. (179565486) (FB23120864)
- `xctrace export` allows for specifying files like .atrc and .logarchive as input, removing the need for a two-step process of running `xctrace import` followed by `xctrace export`. (179742657)

<a id="Swift-Compiler"></a>

### Swift Compiler

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- The Swift dependency scanner has been optimized to avoid redundant setup work and header searches when looking up Clang modules during a single dependency-scan action, substantially improving scanning performance.

  As a consequence of this change, every Clang module reachable from a single Swift dependency-scan action must have a unique module name. If two module maps visible to the same scan declare a Clang module with the same name, the scan may report an error. Previously, the scanner may have tolerated duplicating names.

  The most common cases are projects or SDKs that vend the same Clang module name from more than one location on the header search path, and vendored third-party sources that ship a module.modulemap redeclaring an SDK module. (136303612)

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- A computed property with both an `init` accessor and an array/dictionary literal initial value will no longer compile if the getter is declared before the `init` accessor.

  ```
   struct S {
     var _strings: [String]
     var strings: [String] = ["hello"] {
       get { _strings }
       @storageRestrictions(initializes: _strings)
       init { _strings = newValue }
     }
   }
  ```

  This is a known source break from SE-0508. (180969028)

  **Workaround:** Swap the `init` accessor and the getter such that the `init` accessor is declared first.

<a id="Swift-Package-Manager"></a>

### Swift Package Manager

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- When one or more test targets in a package experience a test failure, `swift test` summarizes them at the end. (168311253)
- `swift test` now supports repeating test cases until a condition is met. Pass `--maximum-repetitions` and `--repeat-until [pass|fail]` to `swift test` to repeat your tests until they pass or fail. Only those test cases that match the repeat condition will be repeated. (177561078)

<a id="SwiftC++-Interoperability"></a>

### Swift/C++ Interoperability

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- When calling a C++ constructor that has parameters with default expressions, you no longer have to pass all arguments explicitly in Swift. (118987713)
- You can now convert Swift closures to instances of `std::function`. For example:

  ```
   // C++
   void processNumbers(const std::vector<int> &numbers, std::function<void(int)> op);
  ```

  ```
   // Swift
   processNumbers([1, 2, 3], .init { print($0) })
  ```

  (133777029)
- You can now annotate constructors of foreign reference types as SWIFT_RETURNS_RETAINED or SWIFT_RETURNS_UNRETAINED. (135368369)
- Mapping `__counted_by` and `std::span` parameters annotated with `__noescape` to Swift Span no longer requires the SafeInteropWrappers experimental feature flag.

  Mapping return values to Span using `__lifetimebound` is still guarded by the experimental feature flag.

  For more information, see [Safe Overloads for Annotated Spans and Pointers](https://www.swift.org/documentation/cxx-interop/safe-interop/#safe-overloads-for-annotated-spans-and-pointers). (148994016)
- Raw pointers to intrusively reference counted types (annotated with `SWIFT_SHARED_REFERENCE`) are imported as Swift classes. Starting with this release you can now annotate smart pointer types pointing to such reference counted types with `SWIFT_REFCOUNTED_PTR` macro to bridge their instances to Swift classes. For example:

  ```
   struct SWIFT_SHARED_REFERENCE(...) SharedObj {};
   
   template <class T>
   struct SWIFT_REFCOUNTED_PTR(.getPtr) Ptr {
       Ptr(T* ptr);
       T *_Nullable getPtr() const { return ptr; }
   };
   
   using ObjPtr = Ptr<SharedObj>;
   
   void takesSmartPtr(ObjPtr p);
  ```

  The function `takesSmartPtr` is imported to Swift as:

  ```
   func takesSmartPtr(_ p: SharedObj?)
  ```

  (156521316)
- Previously, safe wrappers could not be generated for functions where the signature contained template instantiations. Any template instantiation would have to be referred to using a typedef instead.

  Safe wrappers can now be generated for functions without wrapping `std::span` parameter types in typedefs, if they are annotated with `__noescape`. Any other template instantiation in the signature still prevents generating a safe wrapper, unless hidden behind a typedef.

  Example:

  ```c++
   // Already supported:
   using IntSpan = std::span<int>;
   void foo(IntSpan x __noescape);
   
   // Now this also works:
   void bar(std::span<int> y __noescape);
   
   // The return type template instantiation here still prevents generating a safe wrapper:
   std::span<int> baz(std::span<int> z __noescape);
  ```

<a id="System"></a>

### System

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- System now provides Swift APIs for the C `stat`, `lstat`, `fstat`, and `fstatat` system calls. This includes a new `Stat` type with initializers from `FilePath`, `FileDescriptor`, or a C string; `FilePath.stat()` and `FileDescriptor.stat()` instance methods; and supporting types (`FileType`, `FileMode`, `FileFlags`, `UserID`, `GroupID`, `DeviceID`, and `Inode`). See [SYS-0006](https://github.com/apple/swift-system/blob/main/Proposals/0006-system-stat.md) for more details. (160612181)

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: Custom `FilePath` or `FileDescriptor` extensions that make unqualified calls to `stat()` or `stat(_)` (without the `Darwin.` qualification) might conflict with the new Swift `stat()` instance methods introduced in [SYS-0006](https://github.com/apple/swift-system/blob/main/Proposals/0006-system-stat.md), causing build errors. See [SYS-0008](https://github.com/apple/swift-system/blob/main/Proposals/0008-backdeploy-cinterop-stat.md) for more details. (177911316)

<a id="Testing"></a>

### Testing

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- In your Test Plan, you can control how the system responds to target application crashes during UI testing by choosing one of four severity levels: off, warning, failure (default), or fatal failure. (168107814)
- Added a filter to the test plan configurations tab. (168608491)
- Added recent tests and open tests filters to the Test Navigator. (168608830)
- Added a file template for launch tests that opts into `runsForEachTargetApplicationUIConfiguration`, so the test runs across every combination of orientation, localization, and appearance your app supports. (168770106)
- When you call an XCTest or Swift Testing assertion within a test from the opposite framework, you will see a runtime issue with warning severity if the assertion failed. Control this behavior with the new Swift Testing and XCTest Interoperability setting in your test plan. (170335449)
- Updated the test plan JSON to sort tags, making it easier to review changes. (174178766)
- XCTest now includes XCUIVoiceOverService, a new UI testing API for verifying VoiceOver behavior in your app. Use it to drive VoiceOver from UI tests and validate focus, spoken output, and navigation across supported platforms. (175858549)

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed an issue where adding an attachment to a test case during the `XCTestObservation` callbacks `testCaseWillStart(_:)` or `testCaseDidFinish(_:)` by calling `XCTestCase.add(_:)` did not persist the attachment in the results. (89059895)
- Fixed: The ‘Test Repetition Mode’ setting now only repeats individual Swift Testing test cases, rather than repeating the entire test plan. (130508488)
- Fixed: Test issues with warning severity now appear in the console. (161919593)
- Fixed: Swift Testing is now better-able to associate recorded issues with the tests that generated them when they occur in detached Swift tasks, on dispatch queues, or on background threads. (169036231)
- Fixed: Large Swift Testing test suites with many parameterized test cases have significantly better performance in Xcode 27. (171415950)
- Fixed: An expected Swift Testing exit test process termination may cause a test failure to be recorded incorrectly during a UI test. (174032826)
- Fixed: When running tests with the swift CLI, cross-framework issues from XCTest are not surfaced when running Swift Testing tests in Swift Package projects. (177970158)
- Fixed: watchOS Unit and UI tests may not run on device. (178874363)
- Fixed: The test link for a parameterized Swift Testing test case now includes a hash of the test’s arguments, allowing individual argument cases of the same test to be uniquely identified. (181841349)
