### Asset Catalog

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

  **Workaround**: Add a symbol glyph to the app’s asset catalog.

<a id="Instruments"></a>

### Instruments

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed an issue where Instruments wouldn’t record [os_log](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/os/os_log) and `os_signpost` data when targeting Simulator devices. (60883664) (FB7639664)

<a id="Interface-Builder"></a>

### Interface Builder

- Fixed an issue that caused some [UINavigationBar](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uinavigationbar) appearance properties set in storyboard and XIB documents to be ignored when building with Xcode 11.4. (60883063) (FB7639654)

<a id="Linking"></a>

### Linking

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

<a id="Previews"></a>

### Previews

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

<a id="Signing-and-Distribution"></a>

### Signing and Distribution

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- Automatic signing may fail to make changes to app IDs that use a seed prefix and not a team ID prefix. (59672760) (FB7593038)

  **Workaround**: Adjust your app ID manually on the [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/account) website, then return to Xcode to generate a provisioning profile.

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Resolved a crash in the distribution workflow caused by a failure to detect the platform of an archived binary. (61228514)

<a id="Simulator"></a>

<a id="Siri-Intents"></a>

### Siri Intents

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed an issue that prevented generation of source files from intent definition files when using the Legacy Build System. (60591035, 61227177)

### Swift Packages

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed an issue where an error like “Swift package product A is linked as a static library by B and C. This will result in duplication of library code.” was incorrectly emitted if an app and an embedded app extension or helper tool statically linked the same package product. If you previously set the `DISABLE_DIAMOND_PROBLEM_DIAGNOSTIC` build setting to work around this issue, you can delete this setting now. (59310009, 61227255)

<a id="Testing"></a>
