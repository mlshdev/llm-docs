#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: Typing in the filter field at the bottom of the Symbols window would create a token for every character  (172423349)
- Fixed an issue where profiling using Metal System Trace with GPU Counters capture could cause memory footprint of Instruments to increase to tens of gigabytes.  (173195251)

<a id="Localization"></a>

### Localization

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: Generated code for String Catalog symbol generation will no longer produce a compiler error for Packages that default to MainActor isolation.  (173302714) (FB22329375)

<a id="Security"></a>

### Swift

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- When a closure with explicit captures is passed as an argument to a `nonisolated(nonsending)` parameter or converted to a `nonisolated(nonsending)` type, its isolation was inferred from the parent context instead of being directly set to `nonisolated(nonsending)`. The difference in isolation wasn’t observable by callers until Swift 6.3.2, which introduced a bug fix for an actor hop optimization that previously didn’t work when a `nonisolated(nonsending)` function value came from a parameter position.

  In particular, this affects projects that have enabled the `NonisolatedNonsendingByDefault` feature (via `ApproachableConcurrency` or directly).

  For example:

  ```swift
   @MainActor
   func compute(_ fn: nonisolated(nonsending) @Sendable () async -> Void) async {
     await fn()
   }
   
   func performComputation() async {
     let x: Int = 42
     await compute { [x] in // closure isolation is inferred to be @concurrent
       print(x)
     }
   }
  ```

  In this example, the Swift compiler would no longer hop back to `@MainActor` after `await fn()` returns because `fn` is `nonisolated(nonsending)` and should have executed on `@MainActor` already, but because the closure isolation was incorrectly inferred to be `@concurrent`, any *synchronous* calls that follow `fn` one are going to be executed in a `@concurrent` isolation context instead of the `@MainActor` one.  (176582055)

  **Workaround:** There are multiple ways to work around this issue.

  ```
    1. Remove explicit captures when values could be captured implicitly.

    The example from Description becomes:	
  ```

  ```swift
   func performComputation() async {
     let x: Int = ...
     await compute {
       print(x)
     }
   }
  ```

  2. Convert a closure into a local function that is explicitly `nonisolated(nonsending)`:

     The example from Description becomes:

  ```swift
   func performComputation() async {
     let x: Int = ...
   
     @Sendable nonisolated(nonsending) func performAction() async {
       print(x)
     }
   
     await compute(performAction)
   }
  ```
