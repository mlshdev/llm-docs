### General

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- You can configure the Touch Bar simulator to simulate either 1st generation or 2nd generation Touch Bars. (53885368)

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- When you create an Objective-C category file by choosing File \> New \> File…, the newly created file includes an import of the AppKit framework. This causes a compilation error for iOS, tvOS, and watchOS. (55977950) (FB7346800)

  **Workaround**: Remove the import of AppKit from the source file.

- A Recommender template is available in Create ML, joining the Image, Sound, Activity, Text and Tabular Classification, Object Detection, Word Tagging and Tabular Regression templates. (56912822)

<a id="Interface-Builder"></a>

### Interface Builder

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- The color picker panel does not respond to choosing a color while a text field in the inspector has insertion focus. (56067005) (FB7358220)

  **Workaround**: Click the Interface Builder canvas to remove focus from the text field, then choose a color in the panel.

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Setting the Selected Segment Tint Color of a segmented control in Interface Builder to a named color doesn’t cause a failure when the view loads on iOS 12 and earlier. (55254963, 55951374)
- Fixed rendering issues for scenes with large simulated metric free-form sizes. (56920189)

<a id="Previews"></a>

### Previews

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- Xcode Previews now use a platform-provided scroll view for the canvas content when running on macOS Catalina 10.15.2 or newer. This change makes it possible to scroll through the canvas using a scroll wheel on a mouse, as well as by dragging horizontal and vertical scrollbars. (53962570)

<a id="Simulator"></a>

### Simulator

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- Third party “endpoint security” software may cause slow simulators, system freezes, or prevent debug processes from running in simulators reliably. This sometimes manifests as `debugserver` disconnections, or sends simulator applications a `SIGKILL` signal. (55853555)

  **Workaround**: Uninstall the third party software.
- Under certain network conditions, GateKeeper may block simulators from booting, and show error code 60 `"launchd` failed to respond.” (55878667)

  **Workaround**: Try to boot the simulator again. Disabling WiFi or disconnecting from any active VPNs may resolve the problem.
- When a new Mac Pro has multiple GPUs, Simulator assigns each booted simulator to one of the available GPUs. (56488185)

<a id="Swift-Packages"></a>

### Swift Packages

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- You can now submit iOS, tvOS, or watchOS apps with a Swift Package that builds a dynamic library. (55564324) (FB7303066)
