#### New Features

- Xcode 26.3 introduces support for agentic coding, a new way in Xcode for developers to build apps, powered by coding agents from Anthropic and OpenAI. With agentic coding, Xcode can work autonomously toward a developer’s goals — from breaking down tasks to making decisions based on the project architecture, and using built-in tools to get things done.

  In addition to Anthropic’s Claude Agent and OpenAI’s Codex integrations, Xcode 26.3 makes its capabilities available through the Model Context Protocol, an open standard that gives developers the flexibility to use any compatible agent or tool with Xcode.

  For more information, see [Setting up coding intelligence](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Xcode/setting-up-coding-intelligence).  (169448160)
- Xcode 26.3 introduces a comprehensive permissions system that gives you fine-grained control over what external agentic coding tools can do in your development environment.  (170740647)

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- Denying Claude or Codex access to a project located in a privacy-protected directory - such as Desktop, Downloads, or Documents - will mean the project cannot be accessed by the agent as no subsequent access request is made and the decision cannot be reversed.  (166387271)

  **Workaround:** If Claude or Codex appear in the Privacy and Security -\> Files and Folders section in System Settings, you can enable access there. If no entry exists, please move your project folder to a new location outside of Desktop, Downloads, or Documents before proceeding.
- Pasting files into the coding assistant UI does not consistently send their contents to agents.  (167657446)

  **Workaround:** Move the file to a known location, like the Desktop or your project’s working directory, and tell the agent that a file has been placed there for it to access.
- Labels in conversation history created by use of coding tools may sometimes suggest that models have changed more lines of code than they actually have.  (168022670)
- Choosing “Clear Recents” from the coding assistant’s conversation list may not clear the list.  (168096005)
- When automatic change application is disabled in the coding assistant, the undo button may not appear after you have applied a proposed change.   (168310593)

  **Workaround:** Use the history view or other tools like git to revert the change.
- Custom slash commands and skills can be rejected by agents when directly invoked by “/skill”.  (169214412)

  **Workaround:** Ask for the skill without using a slash: ‘use the `{skill-name}` skill’
- Some agent settings, such as turning on/off provider-specific telemetry or disallowing integrated web tools, may not be immediately respected by all agents.   (169316968)

  **Workaround:** Relaunch Xcode after changing these settings.
- MCP clients that attempt to connect to Xcode when external MCP connections are turned off can still appear as active or inactive connections in Xcode’s UI. These clients remain blocked from accessing Xcode.  (169542597)
