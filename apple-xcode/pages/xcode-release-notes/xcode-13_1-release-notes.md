### Debugging

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- Console, Xcode, `lldb`, and debugging tools can’t symbolicate crash logs that macOS transfers from connected devices running iOS 15, watchOS 8, or tvOS 15. (78124467, 83760462, 84048036, 84048399) (FB9669482)

  **Workaround**: Use Xcode’s Devices & Simulators window \> View Device Logs to import log files from connected devices, and transform them into a human-readable form. You can also access crash logs directly on iOS devices using the Settings app under Privacy \> Analytics \> Analytics Data and use the share sheet to transfer them to a Mac without any loss of information. Open the resulting log files using Console, or by dragging and dropping them onto Xcode in the Dock.

### SwiftUI

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- In Previews and in simulated iOS 15 devices, [Button](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/button) elements support the iPad cursor hover states by default, but in iOS 15.1 [BorderedButtonStyle](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/borderedbuttonstyle) no longer has a default hover effect. Use the [HoverEffect](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/hovereffect) modifier on the `Button` to add a default hover effect when running in iOS 15.1. (83516916)
