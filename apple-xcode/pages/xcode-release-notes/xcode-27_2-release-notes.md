### Device Hub

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- Keyboard and mouse inputs to simulators for OS versions before iOS 18.0, tvOS 18.0, watchOS 11.0, and visionOS 2.0 are not accepted. (181945323)
- After disconnecting a physical device from Device Hub when “Simulate Hardware Keyboard” was in use, the device may remain in “hardware keyboard” mode for up to 2 minutes. This will cause the software keyboard to not appear when selecting a text field. (182553164)

  **Workaround:** Wait 2 minutes for the condition to clear.

### Previews

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed an occasional issue where selecting a preview from a preview group’s thumbnail grid on macOS would fail to 1-up the right preview. (183475595)
- Fixed: A clearer error is now shown when the selected platform does not support a preview’s content. (185436582)
- Fixed: The RenderPreview MCP tool now returns the list of available render destinations, and lets the caller specify which destination to use for rendering. (186442676)

### Previews & Playgrounds

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: A clearer error with recovery steps is now shown when previews fail because another user account on this Mac owns the Previews JIT directory. (184564292)

<a id="Project-Format"></a>

### Project Format

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- Xcode now supports a JSON-based project format (.xcproj) that’s more readable, merge-friendly, and easier for coding agents to edit. Enable it in the file inspector. Projects using .xcproj also open in earlier versions of Xcode 27. Learn more in [Updating your Xcode project configuration file format](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/updating-your-xcode-project-configuration-file-format). (184661114)

<a id="SDK"></a>

### SDK

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS SDKs in Xcode 27.2 incorrectly report 27.1 as a valid deployment target. Builds and other functionality may have unexpected behavior if this deployment target is used. Mac Catalyst builds with a 27.1 or 27.2 deployment target may be unable to use newly introduced API. (187160501)

<a id="Simulator"></a>

### Simulator

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- Some simulator runtimes are not completely deleted when removed, re-appearing after a reboot. (141290052) (FB16083602)
