# TN3145: HDR video metadata

**Kind:** Technote

Learn about the usage and requirements of “Ambient Viewing Environment” metadata with HLG and / or Dolby Vision™ Profile 8.4 playback.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

Starting with iPhone 12, apps can capture, play back, edit and export HDR Video with Dolby Vision.

The normal office or home lighting when using an iPhone indoors is around 314 lux (a measurement of light level intensity). This is significantly different than most of the theatrical movie content graded by professional colorists, which is typically done in a dark room with a 5 nit surround. In order to provide an optimal viewing experience, it’s useful to differentiate between the two types of content for wider viewing conditions. This is especially beneficial when playing back HDR contents on mobile devices where the ambient lighting condition can change dramatically.

> **Note**

> A Box in the ISOBMFF (ISO/IEC 14496-12) specification is the same as an Atom in the QuickTime File Format (QTFF). Likewise, a VisualSampleEntry in the ISOBMFF specification is analogous to a video media sample description in the QTFF.

There’s an existing definition in the ISOBMFF (ISO/IEC 14496-12) document:

**12.1.9 Ambient viewing environment**

**12.1.9.1 Definition**

The AmbientViewingEnvironmentBox box may be used to provide information about the characteristics of the nominal ambient viewing environment for the display of the associated video content and may be present in a VisualSampleEntry. The syntax elements of the ambient viewing environment box may assist the receiving system in adapting the received video content for local display in viewing environments that may be similar or may substantially differ from those assumed or intended when mastering the video content. It is functionally equivalent to, and shall be as described in, the ambient viewing environment SEI message in (ITU-T H.265 |I ISO/IEC 23008-2).

Note: This is a Box, not a FullBox (similar to PixelAspectRatioBox).

**12.1.9.2 Syntax**

```
class AmbientViewingEnvironmentBox extends Box('amve') { 
    unsigned int(32) ambient_illuminance;
    unsigned int(16) ambient_light_x;
    unsigned int(16) ambient_light_y;
}
```

Semantics for `ambient_illuminance`, `ambient_light_x` and `ambient_light_y` values are in the HVEC (ITU-T H.265 | ISO/IEC 23008-2) document.

## Dolby Vision Profile 8.4

iOS 14 and macOS 11 introduced support for Dolby Vision Profile 8.4. Refer to Dolby Vision Streams within the ISOBMFF for the syntax and semantics of the metadata stored within the Dolby Decoder Configuration Record (`'dvvC'`).

<a id="Constraints-on-Sample-Description--Sample-Entry"></a>

### Constraints on Sample Description / Sample Entry

- The codec type shall be `'hvc1'`.
- HEVC shall be encoded at Main10 Profile.
- Dolby Vision Profile 8.4.
- Only Single-track files are supported.
- The Dolby Decoder Configuration Record (`'dvvC'`) shall be present.
- The color (`'colr'`) atom with these values shall be present.

  - Color Primaries shall be set to 9 (indicating ITU-R BT.2020).
  - Color Transfer Function Index shall be set to 18 (indicating ITU-R BT.2100 HLG).
  - Color Matrix Index shall be set to 9 (indicating ITU-R BT.2020).
- The ambient viewing environment atom (`'amve'`) shall be present.

<a id="Capture"></a>

## Capture

Starting with iPhone 12, camera-captured content in Dolby Vision Profile 8.4 and / or HLG format contains the ‘amve’ format description extension in the file (kCMFormatDescriptionExtension_AmbientViewingEnvironment). This is based on ISO/IEC 23008- 2:2017, D.2.39 ambient viewing environment SEI message.

```swift
//Retrieving the ambient viewing environment atom (`'amve'`) from a CMSampleBuffer.
let ambientViewingEnvironment = sampleBuffer.formatDescription?.extensions[.ambentViewingEnvironment]
```

<a id="Playing-Back-HDR-Video"></a>

## Playing Back HDR Video

Playback using AVPlayer will provide optimal tone mapping on any Apple device. If your application uses `AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer` or `VTDecompressionSession`, you should take extra steps to ensure the `ambientViewingEnvironment` is attached to the `CMSampleBuffer` or `CVPixelBuffer` that are then provided to `enqueueSampleBuffer`.

During playback using `AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer`, the `FormatDescription` attached to the `CMSampleBuffer` may contain the `kCMFormatDescriptionExtension_AmbientViewingEnvironment`.

HDR-rendering applications may check the parameters in the values in the ambient Viewing Environment atoms (`'amve'`) and pick the correct ambient adaptation strategy for their usage cases.

<a id="Exporting-HDR-Video"></a>

## Exporting HDR Video

It is important to preserve the ambient viewing environment metadata during transcoding, as removing this information will result in the video not being displayed correctly on Apple devices due to extra bright imagery. Apple APIs will by default preserve the ambient viewing environment metadata when exporting HDR Video in Dolby Vision Profile 8.4. If you create a new pixel buffer, you need to make sure to take the ambient viewing environment extension from the source and attach it to the new pixel buffer.
