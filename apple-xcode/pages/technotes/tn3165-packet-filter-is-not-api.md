# TN3165: Packet Filter is not API

**Kind:** Technote

Plan your migration from Packet Filter to Network Extension.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

macOS implements the BSD Packet Filter mechanism. This has two expected use cases:

- As an implementation detail of various system services built-in to macOS
- As an advanced feature for users, site admins, and so on

It is not considered API.  Do not use Packet Filter in a software product that you distribute to a wide audience.  If you’re currently shipping software that relies on Packet Filter, plan to migrate to [Network Extension](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/networkextension).

## Packet Filter fundamentals

Packet Filter, oftened shorted to just PF or even pf, shows up in a number of places:

- The `/dev/pf` character device
- Various `/etc/pf*` configuration files
- The `pfctl` command-line tool
- The `pfctl` and `pf.conf` man pages

PF implements rule-based filtering.  These rules are manipulated by various system services and, less commonly, by the user.  PF is not considered API because the PF rules you install might clash with those installed by:

- The user
- macOS system services, either now or in the future
- Other third-party products

## Moving off packet filter

If you’re currently shipping a product based on PF, plan to migrate it to a supported API.  In most cases that means creating a [Network Extension](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/networkextension) provider:

- If your product is a VPN, create either a [packet tunnel](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/networkextension/packet-tunnel-provider) or [app proxy](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/networkextension/app-proxy-provider) provider.
- If your product looks at, and potentially blocks, TCP connections or UDP flows, create a [content filter provider](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/networkextension/content-filter-providers).
- If your product looks at, and potentially blocks, network packets, create a [packet filter provider](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/networkextension/content-filter-providers).
- If your product wants to intercept DNS queries, create a [DNS proxy provider](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/networkextension/dns-proxy-provider).
- If none of these providers meet your specific needs, create a [transparent proxy provider](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/networkextension/netransparentproxyprovider).

For information about packaging and OS version constraints, see [TN3134: Network Extension provider deployment](tn3134-network-extension-provider-deployment.md).

If your product needs to do something that’s not covered by one of these providers, use [Feedback Assistant](https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/) to let us know what’s missing.

## Test during the transition

It may take you some time to migrate from PF to Network Extension.  In the meantime, test your existing product to ensure that it’s compatible with various macOS system services.  Specifically, test with:

- Mac Virtual Display for visionOS devices
- Xcode
- Internet Sharing
- AirDrop
- Other [Continuity features](https://www.apple.com/macos/continuity/)

Also, consider testing with products from other third-party developers who work in this space.

When testing with Xcode, check that you can build, run, and debug an app on your iOS device over the network.  Then repeat this test with the device connected via USB.  Xcode 15 and later use the networking stack to communicate with the iOS device even when it’s directly connected.

If you set up these tests with your existing product, you’ll be able to reuse them to validate the functionality of your Network Extension based product.
