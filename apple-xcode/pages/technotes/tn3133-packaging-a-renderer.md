# TN3133: Packaging a Metal renderer

**Kind:** Technote

Distribute a Metal renderer in a Swift package.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

Several individual pieces make up a Metal renderer: The CPU-side app code, the GPU-side shaders, and the structures that the app code and the shaders share. Bundling these pieces together in a single Swift package is an excellent way to modularize a renderer for use in multiple projects. Read this technote to discover a Swift package structure that shares C structs between Swift and Metal code, and to learn how to access the compiled Metal source as a `MTLLibrary`.

## Configure the package manifest

The package structure that enables you to package Swift, Metal, and shared C sources in a single Swift package requires two [Target](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/packagedescription/target) declarations, as shown in the following example package manifest:

```swift
// swift-tools-version:5.5

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "MyRenderer",
    products: [
        .library(
            name: "MyRenderer",
            targets: ["MyRenderer"]),
    ],
    targets: [
        // MyRenderer contains .swift and .metal files.
        .target(
            name: "MyRenderer",
            dependencies: ["MySharedTypes"]),

        // MySharedTypes contains a .h file nested inside of a folder named "include", and an empty .m file, specifying that the target should be compiled as an Obj-C target.
        .target(name: "MySharedTypes")
    ]
)
```

The `MyRenderer` target contains the Swift source files, as well as the Metal source files.

The `MySharedTypes` target contains the shared C structs within a header file. Store this header in the directory specified as the [publicHeadersPath](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/packagedescription/target/publicheaderspath) for this target, so that the header is accessible from the `MyRenderer` target. It’s also important to have at least one Obj-C, C, or C++ implementation file in this target.

> **Note**

> A target cannot have source files from both Swift and C-family languages, but it’s OK to have Swift and Metal sources in the same target because SwiftPM treats Metal files as resource files.

Add the `MySharedTypes` target as a dependency of the `MyRenderer` target to access the shared C structs in the `MyRenderer` target.

Here is a visual representation of the file structure described in the example above:

```
.
└── MyRenderer
    ├── Package.swift
    ├── README.md
    └── Sources
        ├── MyRenderer
        │   ├── Renderer.swift
        │   └── Shaders.metal
        └── MySharedTypes
            ├── SharedTypes.m
            └── include
                └── SharedTypes.h
```

## Accessing the shared C structs in Swift

Swift Package Manager creates a module that contains the C structs found in the [publicHeadersPath](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/packagedescription/target/publicheaderspath), and because the Swift target is dependent on the C target, the C structs are directly accessible from Swift.

Continuing with the same naming from the example above, consider the following header located at `MyRenderer/Sources/MySharedTypes/include/SharedTypes.h`:

```Obj-C
#ifndef SharedTypes_h
#define SharedTypes_h

#import <simd/simd.h>

typedef struct {
    vector_float2 position;
    vector_float4 color;
} AAPLVertex;

#endif /* SharedTypes_h */
```

The shared types are accessible in Swift files after importing the `MySharedTypes` module, for example:

```swift
import MySharedTypes

let vertex = AAPLVertex(position: .init(250, -250), color: .init(1, 0, 0, 1))
```

<a id="Accessing-the-shared-C-structs-in-Metal"></a>

## Accessing the shared C structs in Metal

Using the same package structure defined above, the shared types are accessible in Metal files after importing the appropriate header file:

```metal
// A relative path to SharedTypes.h.
#import "../MySharedTypes/include/SharedTypes.h"

// Use any C types found in the imported header in this Metal file.
```

<a id="Retrieving-the-precompiled-Metal-library"></a>

## Retrieving the precompiled Metal library

Swift Package Manager compiles the Metal source to a `.metallib` and stores it in the resource bundle of the target. This resource bundle is accessible from Swift through the `Bundle.module` static property.

To create a `MTLLibrary` from this bundle in the Swift target:

```swift
do {
  // device is a `MTLDevice`.
  let library = try device.makeDefaultLibrary(bundle: Bundle.module)
} catch {
  // Handle the error.
}
```

For more information about the `Bundle.module` static property, see [Bundling resources with a Swift package](../xcode/bundling-resources-with-a-swift-package.md).

## Introducing a custom Metal compilation step

You might want to invoke the `metal` command-line tool yourself, and provide it with arguments that fit your specific needs. For example, you could compile your Metal source with debug symbols to enable shader debugging in a client app.

To introduce a custom Metal compilation step to the build process, create a Swift Package Build Tool Plugin that invokes the `metal` command-line tool with custom arguments, precompiles a `.metallib`, and stores it in the target’s resources directory by specifying it as an output file of the build command. Then, apply the plugin to the target that contains your `.metal` files.

For more information about creating and applying a Swift Package Build Tool Plugin, see [Create Swift Package plugins](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/110401/).
