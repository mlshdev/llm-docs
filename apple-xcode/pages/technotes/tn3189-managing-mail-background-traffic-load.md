# TN3189: Managing Mail background traffic load

**Kind:** Technote

Identify iOS Mail background traffic and manage its impact on your IMAP server.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

To enhance the user experience, iOS Mail downloads a user’s email in the background. As part of a software update, some email data may require re-downloading. Since many devices will update at similar times, iOS Mail introduces a mechanism for IMAP email servers to limit concurrent downloads.

This process involves two main steps:

1. **Client identification:** [RFC 3501](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3501) IMAP email servers can detect if a connection is for a background download. iOS Mail clients identify themselves to the server using the `ID` command. Starting with iOS 18.5, this command includes an `event` field. This field will indicate if the connection is being used for background downloading.
2. **Load shedding:** If the server needs to limit its load and the client has been identified as a background download, the server should send a `NO [UNAVAILABLE]` tagged response to the `ID` command. This will result in the background download being postponed, after which the client will retry the download.

## Identify background traffic from Mail

Starting with iOS 18.5, the [RFC 2971](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2971) `ID` command includes an `event` field. The value of this field is either `NIL` or a list of comma-separated identifiers.

The server should only consider the `event` field value if the email client identifies itself with a `name` field that has a `com.apple.` prefix. For example, `"name" "com.apple.email.maild"` indicates that this is the the Mail app.

If the comma-separated identifiers of the `event` field include either:

- `indexer`, or
- `back-fill`,

it indicates that the connection is being used for background downloading.

> **Note**

> The event field may contain other identifiers, either by themselves or as a list of comma-separated identifiers. The server should ignore all identifiers except `indexer` and `back-fill`. Allowing for other identifiers supports extension without affecting IMAP email servers’ ability to detect background downloading.

The `event` field could take on values such as:

- `periodic`
- `periodic,push`
- `NIL`

These would *not* indicate a background download. However, values such as:

- `back-fill`
- `periodic,back-fill`
- `back-fill,periodic`
- `indexer`

would indicate background download activity because they include `indexer` or `back-fill`.

Here’s an example interaction between the client (C) and server (S):

```
C: A1 ID ("name" "com.apple.email.maild" "os" "iOS" "vendor" "Apple Inc" "event" NIL)
S: * ID ("name" "Mail Server" "version" "3")
S: A1 OK Completed
```

In this example, the client did include the `event` field, but its value is `NIL`. This is not a background download.

Here’s another example interaction:

```text
C: A1 ID ("name" "com.apple.email.search-indexer" "os" "iOS" "vendor" "Apple Inc" "event" "indexer")
S: * ID ("name" "Mail Server" "version" "3")
S: A1 OK Completed
```

In this case, the client indicated that it is performing a background download through the `indexer` value of the `event` field.

## Tell Mail to back off

Since iOS Mail may use an already established connection to perform background activity, iOS Mail might send subsequent `ID` commands with updated `event` fields. These will always contain the full set of fields of the original `ID` command, notably the `name` and `event` field. These subsequent `ID` commands may include switching from non-background to background download.

The load shedding using `NO [UNAVAILABLE]` for background downloads lets IMAP email servers reduce peak load without a direct impact on user experience.

IMAP email servers should only send `NO [UNAVAILABLE]` when the Mail app has identified itself as Mail through the `name` field, and has indicated that it is doing background downloads through the `event` field as noted above.

Here’s an example of an interaction where the IMAP email server tell the Mail app to back off:

```text
C: A1 ID ("name" "com.apple.email.maild" "os" "iOS" "vendor" "Apple Inc" "event" "back-fill,periodic")
S: * ID ("name" "Mail Server" "version" "3")
S: A1 NO [UNAVAILABLE] Completed
```

Here the IMAP email server responds with a tagged response containing `NO` and the response code `UNAVAILABLE,` as defined in [RFC 3501](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3501) and [RFC 5530](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5530). This informs the iOS Mail app to back off, and it will close the connection.

> **Note**

> Mail does not include an event field on macOS. It also doesn’t handle load shedding through the `NO [UNAVAILABLE]` server response.

## Prioritize Mail traffic

If the IMAP email server needs to reduce iOS Mail traffic, it should start by shedding traffic identified with `indexer` in the `event` field. This traffic downloads older message content for Apple Intelligence that Mail doesn’t save on the device.

If the server still needs to reduce load, it should next shed traffic identified with `back-fill` in the `event` field. This traffic downloads messages that Mail saves to disk.

The server shouldn’t shed the remaining iOS Mail traffic, which downloads new messages. Doing so would prevent users from receiving new messages.
