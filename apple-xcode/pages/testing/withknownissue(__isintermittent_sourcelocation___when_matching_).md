# withKnownIssue(\_:isIntermittent:sourceLocation:\_:when:matching:)

**Framework:** Swift Testing  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** iOS · iPadOS · Mac Catalyst · macOS · tvOS · visionOS · watchOS · Swift 6.0+ · Xcode 16.0+

Invoke a function that has a known issue that is expected to occur during its execution.

## Declaration

```swift
func withKnownIssue(_ comment: Comment? = nil, isIntermittent: Bool = false, sourceLocation: SourceLocation = #_sourceLocation, _ body: () throws -> Void, when precondition: () -> Bool = { true }, matching issueMatcher: @escaping KnownIssueMatcher = { _ in true }) rethrows
```

## Parameters

- `comment`: An optional comment describing the known issue.
- `isIntermittent`: Whether or not the known issue occurs intermittently. If this argument is `true` and the known issue does not occur, no secondary issue is recorded.
- `sourceLocation`: The source location to which any recorded issues should be attributed.
- `body`: The function to invoke.
- `precondition`: A function that determines if issues are known to occur during the execution of `body`. If this function returns `true`, encountered issues that are matched by `issueMatcher` are considered to be known issues; if this function returns `false`, `issueMatcher` is not called and they are treated as unknown.
- `issueMatcher`: A function to invoke when an issue occurs that is used to determine if the issue is known to occur. By default, all issues match.

## Discussion

> **Throws**

> Whatever is thrown by `body`, unless it is matched by `issueMatcher`.

Use this function when a test is known to record one or more issues that should not cause the test to fail, or if a precondition affects whether issues are known to occur. For example:

```swift
@Test func example() throws {
  try withKnownIssue {
    try flakyCall()
  } when: {
    callsAreFlakyOnThisPlatform()
  } matching: { issue in
    issue.error is FileNotFoundError
  }
}
```

It is not necessary to specify both `precondition` and `issueMatcher` if only one is relevant. If all errors and issues should be considered known issues, use [withKnownIssue(\_:isIntermittent:sourceLocation:\_:)](withknownissue%28__isintermittent_sourcelocation___%29.md) instead.

> **Note**

> `issueMatcher` may be invoked more than once for the same issue.
