## Discussion

If the current task is running a test, or is a subtask of another task that is running a test, the value of this property describes that test. If no test is currently running, the value of this property is `nil`.

If the current task is detached from a task that started running a test, or if the current thread was created without using Swift concurrency (e.g. by using [Thread.detachNewThread(\_:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/thread/2088563-detachnewthread) or [DispatchQueue.async(execute:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/dispatch/dispatchqueue/2016103-async)), the value of this property may be `nil`.
