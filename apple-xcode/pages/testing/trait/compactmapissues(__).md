# compactMapIssues(\_:)

**Framework:** Swift Testing  
**Kind:** Type Method  
**Availability:** Swift 6.2+ · Xcode 26.0+

Constructs an trait that transforms issues recorded by a test.

## Declaration

```swift
static func compactMapIssues(_ transform: @escaping @Sendable (Issue) -> Issue?) -> Self
```

## Parameters

- `transform`: A closure called for each issue recorded by the test this trait is applied to. It is passed a recorded issue, and returns an optional issue to replace the passed-in one.

## Return Value

An instance of [IssueHandlingTrait](../issuehandlingtrait.md) that transforms issues.

## Discussion

The `transform` closure is called synchronously each time an issue is recorded by the test this trait is applied to. The closure is passed the recorded issue, and if it returns a non-`nil` value, that will be recorded instead of the original. Otherwise, if the closure returns `nil`, the issue is suppressed and will not be included in the results.

The `transform` closure may be called more than once if the test records multiple issues. If more than one instance of this trait is applied to a test (including via inheritance from a containing suite), the `transform` closure for each instance will be called in right-to-left, innermost-to- outermost order, unless `nil` is returned, which will skip invoking the remaining traits’ closures.

Within `transform`, you may access the current test or test case (if any) using [current](../test/current.md) [current](../test/case/current.md), respectively. You may also record new issues, although they will only be handled by issue handling traits which precede this trait or were inherited from a containing suite.

> **Note**

> `transform` will never be passed an issue for which the value of [kind](../issue/kind-swift.property.md) is [Issue.Kind.system](../issue/kind-swift.enum/system.md), and may not return such an issue.
