# filterIssues(\_:)

**Framework:** Swift Testing  
**Kind:** Type Method  
**Availability:** Swift 6.2+ · Xcode 26.0+

Constructs a trait that filters issues recorded by a test.

## Declaration

```swift
static func filterIssues(_ isIncluded: @escaping @Sendable (Issue) -> Bool) -> Self
```

## Parameters

- `isIncluded`: The predicate with which to filter issues recorded by the test this trait is applied to. It is passed a recorded issue, and should return `true` if the issue should be included, or `false` if it should be suppressed.

## Return Value

An instance of [IssueHandlingTrait](../issuehandlingtrait.md) that filters issues.

<a id="discussion"></a>

## Discussion

The `isIncluded` closure is called synchronously each time an issue is recorded by the test this trait is applied to. The closure is passed the recorded issue, and if it returns `true`, the issue will be preserved in the test results. Otherwise, if the closure returns `false`, the issue will not be included in the test results.

The `isIncluded` closure may be called more than once if the test records multiple issues. If more than one instance of this trait is applied to a test (including via inheritance from a containing suite), the `isIncluded` closure for each instance will be called in right-to-left, innermost-to- outermost order, unless `false` is returned, which will skip invoking the remaining traits’ closures.

Within `isIncluded`, you may access the current test or test case (if any) using [current](../test/current.md) [current](../test/case/current.md), respectively. You may also record new issues, although they will only be handled by issue handling traits which precede this trait or were inherited from a containing suite.

> **Note**

> `isIncluded` will never be passed an issue for which the value of [kind](../issue/kind-swift.property.md) is [Issue.Kind.system](../issue/kind-swift.enum/system.md).
