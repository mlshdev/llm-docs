# Choice

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** Installer JS

A single installation choice.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Choice objects are properties of the `choices` global variable and represent the installation choices defined in a distribution package.

The name of each property of the `choices` array corresponds to the `choice-id` attribute of each of the distribution’s installation choices (see [Distribution Definition XML Schema Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/DeveloperTools/Reference/DistributionDefinitionRef/Chapters/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40005370) for more information). Therefore, a specific choice is accessed this way:

<a id="2556490"></a>

**Listing 1**

```javascript
choices.<choice-id>
```

`<choice-id>` represents the identifier of the desired choice in the installation definition. For example, to access the `selected` property of a choice with `'choice_a'` as its identifier, you would use the following expression:

<a id="2556492"></a>

**Listing 2**

```javascript
choices.['choice_a'].selected
```
