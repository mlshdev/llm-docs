## Overview

The possible values of this property are:

- `'clean'`: None of the packages are installed.
- `'installed'`: All the packages are already installed.
- `'upgrade'`: The versions of all the packages are higher than the versions of the installed packages.
- `'downgrade'`: The versions of all the packages are lower than the versions of the installed packages.
- `'mixed'`: At least two of the following conditions are true:

  - One or more of the packages are upgrades.
  - One or more of the packages are downgrades.
  - One or more of the packages are not installed.

For example, if a distribution contains a choice with a required package, you may deselect that choice if the installed package is more recent.
