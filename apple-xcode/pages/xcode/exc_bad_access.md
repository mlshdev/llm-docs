**Kind:** Article

A bad access to memory terminated the process.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

This exception is usually accompanied by either the `SIGBUS` or `SIGSEGV` signal; for more information, see [EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGBUS)](sigbus.md) or [EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGSEGV)](sigsegv.md).

### Exceptions

- [EXC_ARITHMETIC](exc_arithmetic.md): An arithmetic problem terminated the process, often because of division by zero or a floating-point error.
- [EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGBUS)](sigbus.md): A bus error terminated the process, often because the process tried to access a misaligned or invalid address in memory, or due to a pointer authentication failure.
- [EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGSEGV)](sigsegv.md): A memory segmentation fault terminated the process, often because the process tried to access an invalid or out-of-bounds address in memory.
- [EXC_BREAKPOINT (SIGTRAP) and EXC_BAD_INSTRUCTION (SIGILL)](sigtrap_sigill.md): A trace trap or invalid CPU instruction interrupted the process, often because the process violated a requirement or timeout.
- [EXC_CRASH](exc_crash.md): The process crashed.
- [EXC_CRASH (SIGABRT)](sigabrt.md): The process terminated because it received an abort signal.
- [EXC_CRASH (SIGKILL)](sigkill.md): The operating system terminated the process, often because a background task violated a requirement, device resources were limited, or the user force quit the app.
- [EXC_CRASH (SIGQUIT)](sigquit.md): Another processes terminated the process, often because the process violated a requirement or timeout.
- [EXC_CRASH (SIGSYS)](sigsys.md): A bad argument to a system call terminated the process.
- [EXC_CRASH (SIGTERM)](sigterm.md): A software termination signal terminated the process.
- [EXC_GUARD](exc_guard.md): The process violated a guarded resource protection, often related to file descriptors.
- [EXC_RESOURCE](exc_resource.md): The operating system stopped the process because the process exceeded a limit on resource consumption, like CPU time or memory.
