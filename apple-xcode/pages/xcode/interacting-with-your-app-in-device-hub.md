# Interacting with your app in Device Hub

**Kind:** Article

Use Device Hub to control interactions with your apps on simulated and physical devices.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

You use similar controls on your Mac to interact with your app on a simulated and physical device that appears in the Device Hub canvas.

When you launch your app on a simulated device, Device Hub opens to show the device screen in a compact window. When you launch your app on a physical device, Xcode runs it on the device. To interact with the device in Device Hub, select the device in the sidebar and click View Screen in the canvas area.

Device Hub surrounds the screen content with a bezel that resembles the target device. In visionOS, it displays a synthetic space to mimic the experience someone would have when they wear the device. Each device bezel and space has specific controls to support interactions.

To interact with a simulated Apple Vision Pro device in Device Hub, see [Interacting with your visionOS app in Device Hub](interacting-with-your-visionos-app-in-device-hub.md).

## Handle camera and microphone access conflicts on physical devices

You can’t access the camera or microphone while interacting with a physical device in Device Hub.

Before you can start interacting with a physical device in Device Hub, quit any apps on the device that access the camera or microphone. Then select the device in the sidebar and click View Screen in the canvas to interact with the device.

While you interact with the device, lower-priority apps that access the camera or microphone, such as Camera and Voice Memos, don’t have access to those sensors and may record silence and empty video.

If you launch higher-priority apps on the device that access the camera or microphone, such as Phone or FaceTime, Device Hub stops the interaction. To continue interacting with the device, quit the apps that use the camera or microphone on the device and click View Screen in Device Hub again.
