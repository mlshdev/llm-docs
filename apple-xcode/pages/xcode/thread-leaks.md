# Thread leaks

**Kind:** Article

Detects when you don’t close threads after use.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

Use this check to detect threads you create using the `pthread_create(_:_:_:_:)` function without a corresponding call to the `pthread_join(_:_:)` function. Leaked threads can result in decreased performance and may lead to crashes. Available in Xcode 8 and later.

### Leaked thread in C

In the following example, the code creates a `thread` variable, but doesn’t close it after use:

```occ
void *run(){
    pthread_exit(0);
}
pthread_t thread;
pthread_create(&thread, NULL, run, NULL); // Error: thread leak
sleep(1);
```

<a id="Solution"></a>

#### Solution

Add a call to the `pthread_join(_:_:)` function.

```swift
void *run(){
    pthread_exit(0);
}
pthread_t thread;
pthread_create(&thread, NULL, run, NULL);
sleep(1);
pthread_join(thread, NULL); // Correct
```

Alternatively, you can create a detached thread by passing the `PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED` attribute to `pthread_create(_:_:_:_:)`, or calling `pthread_detach(_:)` on the thread after creation.
