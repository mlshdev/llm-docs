# Creating and using custom capture scopes

**Kind:** Article

Capture specific GPU commands by using custom capture scopes.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

When you capture a frame using the default capture scope by clicking the Metal Capture button in Xcode’s debug bar, the resulting capture contains all of the data for a single frame. In some cases, you may want to debug a partial frame rather than an entire frame. You can accomplish this by setting up and using a custom capture scope that lets you choose exactly which Metal commands to record.

> **Note**

> Don’t allocate custom capture scopes yourself. Instead, call one of the [MTLCaptureManager](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlcapturemanager) methods: [makeCaptureScope(device:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlcapturemanager/makecapturescope%28device:%29) or [makeCaptureScope(commandQueue:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlcapturemanager/makecapturescope%28commandqueue:%29-1rozd).

### Define capture boundaries

Call [begin()](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlcapturescope/begin%28%29) on your capture scope to instruct the Metal debugger to record your app’s subsequent Metal activity. To stop recording a frame and to present the Metal debugger, call [end()](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlcapturescope/end%28%29).

```swift
// Create myCaptureScope outside of your rendering loop.
myCaptureScope.begin()

if let commandBuffer = commandQueue.makeCommandBuffer() {
    // Do Metal work.
    commandBuffer.commit()
}

myCaptureScope.end()
```

> **Important**

> Create capture scopes outside your rendering or compute loop, situating your calls between [begin()](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlcapturescope/begin%28%29) and [end()](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlcapturescope/end%28%29). For Metal capture to work correctly, you need to hold a strong reference to an active capture scope for the duration of the work that the capture scope contains.

### Label your capture scope

To identify your custom capture scope when capturing a trace from the Metal Capture popover, set your capture scope’s label property.

```swift
myCaptureScope.label = "My Capture Scope"
```

When you’re ready to capture a frame, click the Metal Capture button in the debug bar. There, you can find your custom capture scope with the matching label available in the list for capturing.

Keep a strong reference to the capture scope in your code for as long as you want the option to be visible in Xcode.

### Make a custom capture scope the default

When you perform a capture from Xcode, it defaults to the capture scope that [defaultCaptureScope](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlcapturemanager/defaultcapturescope) specifies. If the value of this property is `nil`, Xcode defines the default capture scope using drawable presentation boundaries; for example, using your calls to the methods [present(\_:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlcommandbuffer/present%28_:%29) or [present()](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtldrawable/present%28%29).

To change the default scope, create an [MTLCaptureScope](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlcapturescope) instance and assign it to [defaultCaptureScope](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlcapturemanager/defaultcapturescope).

```swift
MTLCaptureManager.shared().defaultCaptureScope = myCaptureScope
```
