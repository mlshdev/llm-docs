# Invalid object size

**Kind:** Article

Detects invalid pointer casts due to differences in the sizes of types.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

Use this check to detect pointer casts when the size of the source type is less than the size of the destination type. Using the result of such a cast to access out-of-bounds data has undefined behavior. Available in Xcode 9 and later.

### Downcast from type with insufficient space in C++

In the following example, the cast from `Base *` to `Derived *` is suspect because `Base` isn’t large enough to contain an instance of `Derived`:

```occ
struct Base {
    int pad1;
};
struct Derived : Base {
    int pad2;
};
Derived *getDerived() {
    return static_cast<Derived *>(new Base); // Error: invalid downcast
}
```

The optimizer may remove an expression, such as `getDerived()->pad2`, because `getDerived()` returns a pointer to an object that isn’t large enough to contain a `pad2` field.

> **Note**

> This UBSan check may not trigger at low optimization levels.

#### Solution

One way to fix this issue is to avoid the downcast, such as by using instances of the `Derived` object wherever you need them.
