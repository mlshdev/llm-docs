# Source code management setup

Allow Xcode Cloud to access your Git repository.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

With Xcode Cloud, you can adopt a CI/CD practice that helps you develop and maintain your apps and frameworks. For Xcode Cloud to automatically build and test your code when you make changes, provide a continuous secure HTTPS connection on port 443 to the Git repository that contains your code.

When you configure your workspace or project to use Xcode Cloud, Xcode analyzes it to detect the Source Code Management (SCM) provider you use. On the “Grant Access to Your Source Code” sheet, click Grant Access and let Xcode guide you through your SCM provider’s native authorization flow.

Make sure you have the required permission or role to grant Xcode Cloud access to your Git repository. Additionally, if you use a self-hosted SCM provider — for example, Bitbucket Server — make sure Xcode Cloud can access your Git repository. For information on required permissions, roles, and IP address ranges that Xcode Cloud uses, see [Use a remote source control repository](setting-up-your-project-to-use-xcode-cloud.md#Use-a-remote-source-control-repository).

> **Note**

> Xcode Cloud comes with support for [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/).
