# Use of stack memory after function return

**Kind:** Article

Detects when you access stack variable memory after its declaring function returns.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

Use this check to detect access to a stack variable that a function declares after that function returns. Attempting to access stack memory in this manner can lead to crashes, or result in unpredictable behavior. Available in Xcode 9 and later.

> **Note**

> This check is in a disabled state by default. You can enable it under the Address Sanitizer option in the Edit Scheme dialogue.

### Use of stack memory after return in C

In the following example, the `integer_pointer_returning_function` function returns a pointer to a stack variable, and there’s an attempt to access the memory of the returned pointer:

```occ
int *integer_pointer_returning_function() {
    int value = 42;
    return &value;
}

int *integer_pointer = integer_returning_function();
*integer_pointer = 43; // Error: invalid access of returned stack memory
```

<a id="Solution"></a>

#### Solution

Use pointer arguments to allow a function to return values by reference.
