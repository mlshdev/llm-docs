# Testing localizations when running your app

**Kind:** Article

Run your app in each language and region you support to thoroughly test your app.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

After you translate strings and adapt resources for the different cultures and regions, test each localization in your app by choosing the language and region in the Run scheme.

### Select a language and region in the scheme

To test your app in a specific language and region:

1. In Xcode, choose Product \> Scheme \> Edit Scheme.
2. In the dialog, select Run in the sidebar and click Options on the right.
3. From the App Language pop-up menu, choose the language and from the App Region pop-up menu, choose the region.
4. Click Close.
5. In the project window toolbar, choose a run destination and click Run.

To use the Language & Region settings on the device, choose System Language and System Region from the pop-up menus.

> **Note**

> If you change the Language & Region settings on a simulated or physical device, the entire operating system uses those settings, not just your app.
