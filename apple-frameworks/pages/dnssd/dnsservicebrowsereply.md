# DNSServiceBrowseReply (Swift)

**Framework:** dnssd  
**Kind:** Type Alias  
**Availability:** iOS 10.0+ · iPadOS 10.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.12+ · tvOS 10.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 3.0+

Callback for handling the results of previous calls to DNSServiceBrowse.

## Declaration

```swift
typealias DNSServiceBrowseReply = (DNSServiceRef?, DNSServiceFlags, UInt32, DNSServiceErrorType, UnsafePointer<CChar>?, UnsafePointer<CChar>?, UnsafePointer<CChar>?, UnsafeMutableRawPointer?) -> Void
```

## Parameters

- `sdRef`: The DNSServiceRef initialized by [DNSServiceBrowse(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:)](dnsservicebrowse%28______________%29.md).
- `flags`: Possible values are [kDNSServiceFlagsMoreComing](kdnsserviceflagsmorecoming.md) and kDNSServiceFlagsAdd. See flag definitions for details.
- `interfaceIndex`: The interface on which the service is advertised. This index should be passed to [DNSServiceResolve(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:)](dnsserviceresolve%28________________%29.md) when resolving the service.
- `errorCode`: Will be [kDNSServiceErr_NoError](kdnsserviceerr_noerror.md) (0) on success, otherwise will indicate the failure that occurred. Other parameters are undefined if the errorCode is nonzero.
- `serviceName`: The discovered service name. This name should be displayed to the user, and stored for subsequent use in the [DNSServiceResolve(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:)](dnsserviceresolve%28________________%29.md) call.
- `regtype`: The service type, which is usually (but not always) the same as was passed to [DNSServiceBrowse(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:)](dnsservicebrowse%28______________%29.md). One case where the discovered service type may not be the same as the requested service type is when using subtypes: The client may want to browse for only those ftp servers that allow anonymous connections. The client will pass the string “\_ftp.\_tcp,\_anon” to [DNSServiceBrowse(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:)](dnsservicebrowse%28______________%29.md), but the type of the service that’s discovered is simply “\_ftp.\_tcp”. The regtype for each discovered service instance should be stored along with the name, so that it can be passed to [DNSServiceResolve(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:)](dnsserviceresolve%28________________%29.md) when the service is later resolved.
- `replyDomain`: The domain of the discovered service instance. This may or may not be the same as the domain that was passed to [DNSServiceBrowse(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:)](dnsservicebrowse%28______________%29.md). The domain for each discovered service instance should be stored along with the name, so that it can be passed to [DNSServiceResolve(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:)](dnsserviceresolve%28________________%29.md) when the service is later resolved.
- `context`: The context pointer that was passed to the callout.
