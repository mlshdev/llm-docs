# TXTRecordGetItemAtIndex(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** dnssd  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** iOS 10.0+ · iPadOS 10.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.12+ · tvOS 10.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 3.0+

Allows you to retrieve a key name and value pointer, given an index into a TXT Record.

## Declaration

```swift
func TXTRecordGetItemAtIndex(_ txtLen: UInt16, _ txtRecord: UnsafeRawPointer!, _ itemIndex: UInt16, _ keyBufLen: UInt16, _ key: UnsafeMutablePointer<CChar>!, _ valueLen: UnsafeMutablePointer<UInt8>!, _ value: UnsafeMutablePointer<UnsafeRawPointer?>!) -> DNSServiceErrorType
```

## Parameters

- `txtLen`: The size of the received TXT Record.
- `txtRecord`: Pointer to the received TXT Record bytes.
- `itemIndex`: An index into the TXT Record.
- `keyBufLen`: The size of the string buffer being supplied.
- `key`: A string buffer used to store the key name. On return, the buffer contains a null-terminated C string giving the key name. DNS-SD TXT keys are usually 9 characters or fewer. To hold the maximum possible key name, the buffer should be 256 bytes long.
- `valueLen`: On output, will be set to the size of the “value” data.
- `value`: On output, \*value is set to point to location within TXT Record bytes that holds the value data.

## Return Value

Returns [kDNSServiceErr_NoError](kdnsserviceerr_noerror.md) on success. Returns kDNSServiceErr_NoMemory if keyBufLen is too short. Returns kDNSServiceErr_Invalid if index is greater than TXTRecordGetCount()-1.

## Discussion

Legal index values range from zero to TXTRecordGetCount()-1. It’s also possible to iterate through keys in a TXT record by simply calling TXTRecordGetItemAtIndex() repeatedly, beginning with index zero and increasing until TXTRecordGetItemAtIndex() returns kDNSServiceErr_Invalid.

On return:

For keys with no value, \*value is set to NULL and \*valueLen is zero.

For keys with empty value, \*value is non-NULL and \*valueLen is zero.

For keys with non-empty value, \*value is non-NULL and \*valueLen is non-zero.
