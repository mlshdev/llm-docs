## Discussion

Specific interface indexes are identified via a 32-bit unsigned integer returned by the if_nametoindex() family of calls.

If the client passes 0 for interface index, that means “do the right thing”, which (at present) means, “if the name is in an mDNS local multicast domain (e.g. ‘local.’, ‘254.169.in-addr.arpa.’, ‘{8,9,A,B}.E.F.ip6.arpa.’) then multicast on all applicable interfaces, otherwise send via unicast to the appropriate DNS server.” Normally, most clients will use 0 for interface index to automatically get the default sensible behaviour.

If the client passes a positive interface index, then that indicates to do the operation only on that one specified interface.

If the client passes [kDNSServiceInterfaceIndexLocalOnly](kdnsserviceinterfaceindexlocalonly.md) when registering a service, then that service will be found \*only\* by other local clients on the same machine that are browsing using [kDNSServiceInterfaceIndexLocalOnly](kdnsserviceinterfaceindexlocalonly.md) or [kDNSServiceInterfaceIndexAny](kdnsserviceinterfaceindexany.md). If a client has a ‘private’ service, accessible only to other processes running on the same machine, this allows the client to advertise that service in a way such that it does not inadvertently appear in service lists on all the other machines on the network.

If the client passes [kDNSServiceInterfaceIndexLocalOnly](kdnsserviceinterfaceindexlocalonly.md) when browsing then it will find \*all\* records registered on that same local machine. Clients explicitly wishing to discover \*only\* LocalOnly services can accomplish this by inspecting the interfaceIndex of each service reported to their [DNSServiceBrowseReply](dnsservicebrowsereply.md) callback function, and discarding those where the interface index is not [kDNSServiceInterfaceIndexLocalOnly](kdnsserviceinterfaceindexlocalonly.md).

[kDNSServiceInterfaceIndexP2P](kdnsserviceinterfaceindexp2p.md) is meaningful only in Browse, QueryRecord, Register, and Resolve operations. It should not be used in other DNSService APIs.

- If [kDNSServiceInterfaceIndexP2P](kdnsserviceinterfaceindexp2p.md) is passed to [DNSServiceBrowse(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:)](dnsservicebrowse%28______________%29.md) or [DNSServiceQueryRecord(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:)](dnsservicequeryrecord%28________________%29.md), it restricts the operation to P2P.
- If kDNSServiceInterfaceIndexP2P is passed to DNSServiceRegister, it is mapped internally to kDNSServiceInterfaceIndexAny with the kDNSServiceFlagsIncludeP2P set.
- If [kDNSServiceInterfaceIndexP2P](kdnsserviceinterfaceindexp2p.md) is passed to [DNSServiceResolve(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:)](dnsserviceresolve%28________________%29.md), it is mapped internally to [kDNSServiceInterfaceIndexAny](kdnsserviceinterfaceindexany.md) with the kDNSServiceFlagsIncludeP2P set, because resolving a P2P service may create and/or enable an interface whose index is not known a priori. The resolve callback will indicate the index of the interface via which the service can be accessed.

If applications pass [kDNSServiceInterfaceIndexAny](kdnsserviceinterfaceindexany.md) to [DNSServiceBrowse(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:)](dnsservicebrowse%28______________%29.md) or [DNSServiceQueryRecord(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:)](dnsservicequeryrecord%28________________%29.md), they must set the kDNSServiceFlagsIncludeP2P flag to include P2P. In this case, if a service instance or the record being queried is found over P2P, the resulting ADD event will indicate [kDNSServiceInterfaceIndexP2P](kdnsserviceinterfaceindexp2p.md) as the interface index.
