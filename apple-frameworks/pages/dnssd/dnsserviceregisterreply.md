# DNSServiceRegisterReply (Swift)

**Framework:** dnssd  
**Kind:** Type Alias  
**Availability:** iOS 10.0+ · iPadOS 10.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.12+ · tvOS 10.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 3.0+

Handler for the results from a previous call to [DNSServiceRegister(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:)](dnsserviceregister%28________________________%29.md).

## Declaration

```swift
typealias DNSServiceRegisterReply = (DNSServiceRef?, DNSServiceFlags, DNSServiceErrorType, UnsafePointer<CChar>?, UnsafePointer<CChar>?, UnsafePointer<CChar>?, UnsafeMutableRawPointer?) -> Void
```

## Parameters

- `sdRef`: The DNSServiceRef initialized by [DNSServiceRegister(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:)](dnsserviceregister%28________________________%29.md).
- `flags`: When a name is successfully registered, the callback will be invoked with the kDNSServiceFlagsAdd flag set. When Wide-Area DNS-SD is in use, it is possible for a single service to get more than one success callback (e.g. one in the “local” multicast DNS domain, and another in a wide-area unicast DNS domain). If a successfully-registered name later suffers a name conflict or similar problem and has to be deregistered, the callback will be invoked with the kDNSServiceFlagsAdd flag not set. The callback is \*not\* invoked in the case where the caller explicitly terminates the service registration by calling DNSServiceRefDeallocate(ref);
- `errorCode`: Will be [kDNSServiceErr_NoError](kdnsserviceerr_noerror.md) on success, otherwise will indicate the failure that occurred (including name conflicts, if the kDNSServiceFlagsNoAutoRename flag was used when registering.) Other parameters are undefined if errorCode is nonzero.
- `name`: The service name registered (if the application did not specify a name in [DNSServiceRegister(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:)](dnsserviceregister%28________________________%29.md), this indicates what name was automatically chosen).
- `regtype`: The type of service registered, as it was passed to the callout.
- `domain`: The domain on which the service was registered (if the application did not specify a domain in [DNSServiceRegister(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:)](dnsserviceregister%28________________________%29.md), this indicates the default domain on which the service was registered).
- `context`: The context pointer that was passed to the callout.
