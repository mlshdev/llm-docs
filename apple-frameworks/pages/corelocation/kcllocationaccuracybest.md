# kCLLocationAccuracyBest (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Location  
**Kind:** Global Variable  
**Availability:** iOS 2.0+ · iPadOS 2.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.6+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

The best level of accuracy available.

## Declaration

```swift
let kCLLocationAccuracyBest: CLLocationAccuracy
```

## Discussion

Specify this constant when you want very high accuracy but don’t need the same level of accuracy required for navigation apps.

This level of accurate is available only if `isAuthorizedForPreciseLocation` is [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true).

### Desired Accuracy Constants

- [kCLLocationAccuracyBestForNavigation](kcllocationaccuracybestfornavigation.md): The highest possible accuracy that uses additional sensor data to facilitate navigation apps.
- [kCLLocationAccuracyNearestTenMeters](kcllocationaccuracynearesttenmeters.md): Accurate to within ten meters of the desired target.
- [kCLLocationAccuracyHundredMeters](kcllocationaccuracyhundredmeters.md): Accurate to within one hundred meters.
- [kCLLocationAccuracyKilometer](kcllocationaccuracykilometer.md): Accurate to the nearest kilometer.
- [kCLLocationAccuracyThreeKilometers](kcllocationaccuracythreekilometers.md): Accurate to the nearest three kilometers.
- [kCLLocationAccuracyReduced](kcllocationaccuracyreduced.md): The level of accuracy used when an app isn’t authorized for full accuracy location data.
