# Ranging for Beacons (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Location  
**Kind:** Sample Code  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · Xcode 11.2+

Configure a device to act as a beacon and to detect surrounding beacons.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

Beacons make location-based products and services available to users by broadcasting information to your device. Ranging is the process of reading the characteristics of a beacon region, such as signal strength, advertising interval, and measured power.

This sample code project configures a device to act as a beacon, and configures a device to use ranging to find surrounding beacons. Use two iOS devices to run the sample, with one acting as a beacon, and the other ranging for the beacon.

### Configure a Device to Act as a Beacon

Run the sample app on the first iOS device. Select the option to Configure a Beacon. The project hardcodes a default value for the UUID that can be changed in `ConfigureBeaconViewController.swift`.

```swift
let beaconUUID = UUID(uuidString: "E2C56DB5-DFFB-48D2-B060-D0F5A71096E0")
```

Optionally modify the major and minor value for the beacon, then select the Enabled switch on the configuration screen to start advertising.

`ConfigureBeaconViewController.swift` contains a view controller object that configures the iOS device running this app to act as a beacon.  The `configureBeaconRegion()` method sets up the region and starts advertising itself.

```swift
if peripheralManager.state == .poweredOn {
    peripheralManager.stopAdvertising()
    if enabled {
        let bundleURL = Bundle.main.bundleIdentifier!
        
        // Defines the beacon identity characteristics the device broadcasts.
        let constraint = CLBeaconIdentityConstraint(uuid: beaconUUID!, major: major, minor: minor)
        region = CLBeaconRegion(beaconIdentityConstraint: constraint, identifier: bundleURL)
        
        let peripheralData = region.peripheralData(withMeasuredPower: nil) as? [String: Any]
        
        // Start broadcasting the beacon identity characteristics.
        peripheralManager.startAdvertising(peripheralData)
    }
```

<a id="Configure-a-Device-to-Range-for-Beacons"></a>

### Configure a Device to Range for Beacons

Using a second iOS device, run the sample app and tap Range for Beacons to scan for beacons. Add a UUID to range for by tapping the Add button in the upper corner of the screen. The hardcoded UUID appears by default.

`RangeBeaconViewController.swift` contains a view controller object that ranges a set of beacon regions that the user adds. As in any location-based service, first request authorization. Use a `CLLocationManager` instance to request that authorization, set up the constraint based on the hardcoded UUID, then tell the instance to start monitoring.

```swift
self.locationManager.requestWhenInUseAuthorization()

// Create a new constraint and add it to the dictionary.
let constraint = CLBeaconIdentityConstraint(uuid: uuid)
self.beaconConstraints[constraint] = []

/*
By monitoring for the beacon before ranging, the app is more
energy efficient if the beacon is not immediately observable.
*/
let beaconRegion = CLBeaconRegion(beaconIdentityConstraint: constraint, identifier: uuid.uuidString)
self.locationManager.startMonitoring(for: beaconRegion)
```

When the device enters the specified region, the `locationManager(_ manager: CLLocationManager, didDetermineState state: CLRegionState, for region: CLRegion)` delegate method receives the region state and starts ranging beacons.

While one or more beacons are in range, the `locationManager(_ manager: CLLocationManager, didRange beacons: [CLBeacon], satisfying beaconConstraint: CLBeaconIdentityConstraint)` delegate method receives their characteristics in the passed array.
