## Discussion

Passing `.none` for authorization requirement creates a session object that doesn’t request a person’s authorization to access Location Services, but the object meets a requested Explicit Service Session requirement if the framework already has authorization.

Passing an authorization requirement other than `.none` causes Location Services to request a person’s permission for the corresponding level of authorization when possible — for example, when your app is in the foreground, when a person hasn’t denied an earlier authorization request, or if parental control settings don’t restrict changes to the ability to request a person’s location.
