# CLBeaconIdentityCondition

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** Core Location  
**Kind:** Class  
**Availability:** iOS 17.0+ · iPadOS 17.0+ · Mac Catalyst 17.0+ · macOS 14.0+

A condition that describes the identity characteristics of a beacon.

## Declaration

```objectivec
@interface CLBeaconIdentityCondition : CLCondition
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Core Location defines a beacon identity by UUID, and major and minor values. You need to specify the UUID. If you only specify a UUID, the framework treats the major and minor values as wildcards and any beacons with the same UUID satisfy the condition. Similarly, if you specify only a UUID and a major value, the framework treats the minor value as a wildcard and any beacons with the same UUID and major value satisfy the condition.

## Topics

### Creating beacon identity conditions

- [initWithUUID:](clbeaconidentitycondition/initwithuuid_.md): Creates a new beacon identity condition with the identifier you specify.
- [initWithUUID:major:](clbeaconidentitycondition/initwithuuid_major_.md): Creates a new beacon identity condition with the identifier and major value you specify.
- [initWithUUID:major:minor:](clbeaconidentitycondition/initwithuuid_major_minor_.md): Creates a new beacon identity condition with the identifier, and major and minor values you specify.

### Accessing the beacon’s properties

- [UUID](clbeaconidentitycondition/uuid.md): A universally unique identifier that represent the beacon’s identifier.
- [major](clbeaconidentitycondition/major.md): The most significant value associated with the beacon.
- [minor](clbeaconidentitycondition/minor.md): The least significant value associated with the beacon.
