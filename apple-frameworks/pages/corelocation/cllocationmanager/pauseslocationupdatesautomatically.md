# pausesLocationUpdatesAutomatically (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Location  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 6.0+ · iPadOS 6.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.15+ · visionOS 1.0+

A Boolean value that indicates whether the location-manager object may pause location updates.

## Declaration

```swift
var pausesLocationUpdatesAutomatically: Bool { get set }
```

## Discussion

Allowing the location manager to pause updates can improve battery life on the target device without sacrificing location data. Setting this property to [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true) causes the location manager to pause updates (and powers down the appropriate hardware) at times when the location data is unlikely to change. For example, if the user stops for food while using a navigation app, the location manager might pause updates for a period of time. You can help the determination of when to pause location updates by assigning a value to the [activityType](activitytype.md) property.

After a pause occurs, it’s your responsibility to restart location services again when you determine that they’re needed. Core Location calls the [locationManagerDidPauseLocationUpdates(\_:)](../cllocationmanagerdelegate/locationmanagerdidpauselocationupdates%28__%29.md) method of your location manager’s delegate to let you know that a pause has occurred. In that method configure a local notification that has a [UNLocationNotificationTrigger](../../usernotifications/unlocationnotificationtrigger.md) to notify when the user exits the current region. The message for the local notification should prompt the user to launch your app again so that it can resume updates.

> **Important**

>  For apps that have in-use authorization, a pause to location updates ends access to location changes until the app launches again and is able to restart those updates. To prevent location updates from stopping entirely, consider disabling this property and changing location accuracy to [kCLLocationAccuracyThreeKilometers](../kcllocationaccuracythreekilometers.md) when your app moves to the background. This allows your app to continue receiving location updates in a power-friendly manner.

On supported platforms the default value of this property is [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true); otherwise the default value is [false](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false) and is immutable.
