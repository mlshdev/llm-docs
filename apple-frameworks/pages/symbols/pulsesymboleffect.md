# PulseSymbolEffect

**Framework:** Symbols  
**Kind:** Structure  
**Availability:** iOS 17.0+ · iPadOS 17.0+ · Mac Catalyst 17.0+ · macOS 14.0+ · tvOS 17.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 10.0+

A type that fades the opacity of some or all layers in a symbol-based image.

## Declaration

```swift
struct PulseSymbolEffect
```

## Overview

A pulse animation applies an opacity ramp to the layers in a symbol. You can choose to animate only layers marked as “always-pulses” or all layers simultaneously. Participating layers reduce their opacity to a minimum value before returning to fully opaque.

> **Important**

>  Because SwiftUI is a state-driven framework, you pass a `value` parameter when adding discrete effects, like bounce. You trigger the animation by changing the `value` parameter. Because AppKit and UIKit are event-driven frameworks, discrete effects animate automatically when added to an image view.

```swift
// Add an effect in SwiftUI.
@State private var value1 = 0
@State private var value2 = 0
var body: some View {
    HStack {
        Image(systemName: "person.text.rectangle")
            // Pulse only layers marked as "always-pulse."
            .symbolEffect(.pulse, value: value1)
            .onTapGesture {
                value1 += 1
            }
        Image(systemName: "person.text.rectangle")
            // Pulse all layers three times simultaneously.
            .symbolEffect(.pulse.wholeSymbol, options: .repeat(3), value: value2)
            .onTapGesture {
                value2 += 1
            }
    }
}
```

```swift
// Add an effect in AppKit and UIKit.
// Pulse only layers marked as "always-pulse."
imageView1.addSymbolEffect(.pulse.byLayer, options: .nonRepeating)
    
// Pulse all layers three times simultaneously.
imageView2.addSymbolEffect(.pulse.wholeSymbol, options: .repeat(3))
```

## Topics

### Determining effect scope

- [byLayer](pulsesymboleffect/bylayer.md): An effect requesting an animation that pulses only the layers marked to always pulse.
- [wholeSymbol](pulsesymboleffect/wholesymbol.md): An effect requesting an animation that pulses all layers simultaneously.

### Accessing the configuration

- [configuration](pulsesymboleffect/configuration.md): The configuration for the effect.
