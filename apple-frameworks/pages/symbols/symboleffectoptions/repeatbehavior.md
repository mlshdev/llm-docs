### Type Properties

- [continuous](repeatbehavior/continuous.md): A repeat behavior that prefers to repeat indefinitely, using continuous animations if available. Continuous animations have an intro, a body that runs as long as the effect is enabled, and an outro. If available these animations provide a smoother animation when an effect repeats indefinitely.
- [periodic](repeatbehavior/periodic.md): A repeat behavior that prefers to repeat indefinitely using periodic animations. Periodic animations play the effect at regular intervals starting and stopping each time.

### Type Methods

- [periodic(\_:delay:)](repeatbehavior/periodic%28__delay_%29.md): A repeat behavior with a preferred play count and delay using periodic animations. Periodic animations play the effect at regular intervals starting and stopping each time.
