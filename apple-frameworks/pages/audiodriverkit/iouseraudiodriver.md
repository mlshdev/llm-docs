# IOUserAudioDriver

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** AudioDriverKit  
**Kind:** Class  
**Availability:** DriverKit 21.0+

A DriverKit provider object that manages communications with an audio device.

## Declaration

```objectivec
class IOUserAudioDriver;
```

## Overview

For the Core Audio host to match against this driver, add the following keys to `IOKitPersonalities`, in the driver’s `Info.plist` file:

```swift
 <key>IOUserAudioDriverUserClientProperties</key>
 <dict>
     <key>IOClass</key>
     <string>IOUserUserClient</string>
     <key>IOUserClass</key>
     <string>IOUserAudioDriverUserClient</string>
 </dict>
```

After matching the host with the driver, the AudioDriverKit framework creates the connection to the Core Audio HAL as soon as the [IOService](../driverkit/ioservice.md) calls [NewUserClient](iouseraudiodriver/newuserclient.md). The driver extension must have the `com.apple.developer.driverkit.allow-any-userclient-access` entitlement.

## Topics

### Running the Driver Service

- [init](iouseraudiodriver/init.md): Handles the basic initialization of the service.
- [Start](iouseraudiodriver/start.md): Starts the current service and associates it with the specified provider.
- [Stop](iouseraudiodriver/stop.md): Stops the service associated with the specified provider.
- [free](iouseraudiodriver/free.md): Performs any final cleanup for the service.

### Getting Information About the Class

- [GetClassID](iouseraudiodriver/getclassid.md): Gets the audio class identifier of the object.
- [GetBaseClassID](iouseraudiodriver/getbaseclassid.md): Gets the audio class identifier of the base class object.
- [IOUserAudioClassID](audiodriverkit/iouseraudioclassid.md): An identifier for the type of audio object.
- [GetWorkQueue](iouseraudiodriver/getworkqueue.md): Gets the work queue created by the audio object, as a pointer to a dispatch queue.
- [GetName](iouseraudiodriver/getname.md): Gets the name of the driver.
- [SetName](iouseraudiodriver/setname.md): Sets the name of the driver.

### Getting the Driver’s Audio Object Identifier

- [kIOUserAudioObjectIDDriver](audiodriverkit/kiouseraudioobjectiddriver.md): The audio object ID of the driver.

### Starting and Stopping the Driver

- [StartDevice](iouseraudiodriver/startdevice.md): Tells the driver to start I/O on an audio device or audio clock device.
- [StopDevice](iouseraudiodriver/stopdevice.md): Tells the driver to stop I/O on an audio device or audio clock device.
- [IOUserAudioObjectID](audiodriverkit/iouseraudioobjectid.md): An identifier that provides a handle on a specific audio object.
- [IOUserAudioStartStopFlags](audiodriverkit/iouseraudiostartstopflags.md): Values that indicate I/O starts or stops.

### Creating a New Client

- [NewUserClient](iouseraudiodriver/newuserclient.md): Requests the creation of a new user client for the service.

### Working with Transport Type

- [GetTransportType](iouseraudiodriver/gettransporttype.md): Gets the transport type of the driver.
- [SetTransportType](iouseraudiodriver/settransporttype.md): Set the transport type of the driver.
- [IOUserAudioTransportType](audiodriverkit/iouseraudiotransporttype.md): The type of transport to deliver audio.

### Working with Audio Objects

- [AddObject](iouseraudiodriver/addobject.md): Adds an audio object to the driver.
- [RemoveObject](iouseraudiodriver/removeobject.md): Removes an audio object from the driver.
- [GetAudioObjectForObjectID](iouseraudiodriver/getaudioobjectforobjectid.md): Gets a pointer to an audio object, given the object’s identifier.

### Communicating with the Host

- [PropertiesChanged](iouseraudiodriver/propertieschanged.md): Informs the host when the state of an object in the driver changes.
- [IOUserAudioObjectPropertySelector](audiodriverkit/iouseraudioobjectpropertyselector.md): A four character code which, along with the scope and element, specific piece of information about an audio object.

### Working with Custom Properties

- [AddCustomProperty](iouseraudiodriver/addcustomproperty.md): Adds a custom property object to the driver.
- [RemoveCustomProperty](iouseraudiodriver/removecustomproperty.md): Removes a previously-added custom property object from the driver.
- [IOUserAudioCustomProperty](iouseraudiocustomproperty.md): A custom property to associate with audio objects.

## Relationships
