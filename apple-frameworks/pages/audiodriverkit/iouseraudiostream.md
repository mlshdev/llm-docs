# IOUserAudioStream

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** AudioDriverKit  
**Kind:** Class  
**Availability:** DriverKit 21.0+

An audio object that performs I/O for an audio device.

## Declaration

```objectivec
class IOUserAudioStream;
```

## Overview

[IOUserAudioStream](iouseraudiostream.md) allocates memory descriptors that the host uses for running I/O. An [IOUserAudioDevice](iouseraudiodevice.md) uses an [IOUserAudioStream](iouseraudiostream.md) instance to perform I/O. Changes to the device that owns a stream may update formats on the underlying stream, which you handle by overriding [HandleChangeCurrentStreamFormat](iouseraudiostream/handlechangecurrentstreamformat.md) and [HandleChangeStreamIsActive](iouseraudiostream/handlechangestreamisactive.md).

## Topics

### Creating an Audio Stream

- [Create](iouseraudiostream/create.md): Allocates and initializes an instance of the audio stream class.
- [init](iouseraudiostream/init.md): Initializes an instance of the audio stream class.
- [IOUserAudioDriver](iouseraudiodriver.md): A DriverKit provider object that manages communications with an audio device.

### Freeing an Audio Stream

- [free](iouseraudiostream/free.md): Frees the audio stream.

### Getting Information About the Class

- [GetClassID](iouseraudiostream/getclassid.md): Gets the audio class identifier of the object.
- [GetBaseClassID](iouseraudiostream/getbaseclassid.md): Gets the audio class identifier of the base class object.
- [IOUserAudioClassID](audiodriverkit/iouseraudioclassid.md): An identifier for the type of audio object.

### Performing I/O

- [StartIO](iouseraudiostream/startio.md): Tells the stream to start I/O.
- [StopIO](iouseraudiostream/stopio.md): Tells the stream to stop I/O.
- [IOUserAudioStartStopFlags](audiodriverkit/iouseraudiostartstopflags.md): Values that indicate I/O starts or stops.

### Working with Stream Formats

- [SetCurrentStreamFormat](iouseraudiostream/setcurrentstreamformat.md): Sets the current stream format to a given audio stream basic description.
- [GetCurrentStreamFormat](iouseraudiostream/getcurrentstreamformat.md): Returns the current stream format, as an audio stream basic description.
- [SetAvailableStreamFormats](iouseraudiostream/setavailablestreamformats.md): Sets the available stream formats to an array of audio stream basic descriptions.
- [GetAvailableStreamFormats](iouseraudiostream/getavailablestreamformats.md): Returns the available stream formats as an array of audio stream basic descriptions.
- [GetNumberAvailableStreamFormats](iouseraudiostream/getnumberavailablestreamformats.md): Returns the number of available stream formats.
- [IOUserAudioStreamBasicDescription](audiodriverkit/iouseraudiostreambasicdescription.md): A structure that encapsulates all of the information for describing the basic format properties of a stream of audio data.
- [GetStreamDirection](iouseraudiostream/getstreamdirection.md): Gets the direction of the stream: input or output.
- [IOUserAudioStreamDirection](audiodriverkit/iouseraudiostreamdirection.md): A type representing the direction of audio flow.
- [SetStreamIsActive](iouseraudiostream/setstreamisactive.md): Sets a Boolean value that indicates whether the stream is active and doing I/O.
- [GetStreamIsActive](iouseraudiostream/getstreamisactive.md): Gets a value that indicates whether the stream is active and doing I/O.

### Working with Stream Terminals

- [SetTerminalType](iouseraudiostream/setterminaltype.md): Sets the terminal type of the stream.
- [GetTerminalType](iouseraudiostream/getterminaltype.md): Gets the terminal type of the stream.
- [IOUserAudioStreamTerminalType](audiodriverkit/iouseraudiostreamterminaltype.md): Constants that describe the terminal type of an audio stream.

### Working with Memory Descriptors

- [GetIOMemoryDescriptor](iouseraudiostream/getiomemorydescriptor.md): Gets the memory descriptor the stream uses for I/O.
- [SetIOMemoryDescriptor](iouseraudiostream/setiomemorydescriptor.md): Sets the memory descriptor the stream uses for I/O.

### Managing Stream Changes

- [HandleChangeCurrentStreamFormat](iouseraudiostream/handlechangecurrentstreamformat.md): Tells the stream the format is changing.
- [HandleChangeStreamIsActive](iouseraudiostream/handlechangestreamisactive.md): Tells the stream the activity state is changing.
- [DeviceSampleRateChanged](iouseraudiostream/devicesampleratechanged.md): Updates stream formats, in response to the owning audio device changing its sample rate.

### Instance Methods

- [GetLatency](iouseraudiostream/getlatency.md)
- [GetStartingChannel](iouseraudiostream/getstartingchannel.md)
- [SetLatency](iouseraudiostream/setlatency.md)
- [SetStartingChannel](iouseraudiostream/setstartingchannel.md)
