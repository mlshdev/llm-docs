# SetAvailableSampleRates

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** AudioDriverKit  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** DriverKit 21.0+

Sets the available sample rates for the clock device.

## Declaration

```objectivec
kern_return_t SetAvailableSampleRates(const double *in_sample_rates, size_t in_num_rates);
```

## Parameters

- `in_sample_rates`: A pointer to a buffer of `double` values containing the available sample rates.
- `in_num_rates`: The number of sample rates in `in_sample_rates` buffer.

## Return Value

[kIOReturnSuccess](../../driverkit/kioreturnsuccess.md) on success, or another value if an error occurs. For a list of error codes, see [Error Codes](../../driverkit/error-codes.md).

## Discussion

If successful, changing the available sample rates sends a notification to the host to update the object state.

This method synchronizes by using the work queue created by the object.
