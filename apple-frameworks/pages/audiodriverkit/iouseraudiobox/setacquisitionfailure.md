## Discussion

Set this code to provide the error to return from failed calls to [HandleChangeAcquireBox](handlechangeacquirebox.md).

If successful, changing the acquisition failure code sends a notification to the host to update the object state.

This method synchronizes by using the work queue created by the object.
