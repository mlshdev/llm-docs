## Overview

Customers use the Settings \> Apple Account \> Subscriptions page in iOS to manage their subscriptions, including upgrading, downgrading, resubscribing, and canceling. When you offer subscriptions through the Advanced Commerce API, the Subscriptions page displays a “Manage in App” button.

You implement a subscription-management page in your app, and create a deep link URL to it that you submit to Apple. The Settings \> Apple Account  \> Subscriptions page then uses your deep link for the “Manage in App” button.

> **Important**

> To submit the subscription-management deep link URL for your eligible Advanced Commerce API app, use the Advanced Commerce API Access form on the [Advanced Commerce API](https://developer.apple.com/in-app-purchase/advanced-commerce-api/) page.

Create the deep link by following these guidelines:

- Follow universal link guidelines for the URL. For more information, see [Allowing apps and websites to link to your content](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/allowing-apps-and-websites-to-link-to-your-content).
- Ensure the deep link lands on a page in your app that provides information about the subscription’s state and options for the customer to manage their subscription, for example, to change the plan, or resubscribe.
- Optionally, provide a unique subscription-management deep link URL for each storefront.
