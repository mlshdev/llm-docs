# Authorizing API requests from your server

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** Advanced Commerce API  
**Kind:** Article

Create JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to authorize Advanced Commerce requests from your server.

## Discussion

The following Advanced Commerce APIs are endpoints that you call from your server:

- [Cancel a Subscription](cancel-a-subscription.md)
- [Change Subscription Metadata](change-subscription-metadata.md)
- [Change Subscription Price](change-subscription-price.md)
- [Migrate a Subscription to Advanced Commerce API](migrate-subscription-to-advanced-commerce-api.md)
- [Request Transaction Refund](request-transaction-refund.md)
- [Revoke Subscription](revoke-subscription.md)

Calls to the Advanced Commerce API’s endpoints require JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for authorization; you obtain keys to create the tokens from your organization’s App Store Connect account. See [Creating API keys to authorize API requests](../appstoreserverapi/creating-api-keys-to-authorize-api-requests.md) to create your keys. See [Generating JSON Web Tokens for API requests](../appstoreserverapi/generating-json-web-tokens-for-api-requests.md) to generate tokens using your keys and send API requests.

After you have a complete and signed token, provide the token in the request’s authorization header as a bearer token. Generate a new token for each new API request, or reuse tokens until they expire.

> **Tip**

> The App Store Server Library provides a client that makes it easier to adopt the Advanced Commerce APIs, including creating the JWTs to authorize calls. For more information, see [Simplifying your implementation by using the App Store Server Library](../appstoreserverapi/simplifying-your-implementation-by-using-the-app-store-server-library.md).
