Configure the generic product IDs in App Store Connect that the Advanced Commerce API requires.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

A generic product ID is an identifier you set up in App Store Connect and use when you call Advanced Commerce APIs.  The generic product IDs tell the API whether your SKU is a one-time purchase or a subscription, and whether it’s a SKU for the Mini Apps Partner Program.

You may need to create up to four generic product IDs, based on the product types your app offers:

- One-time purchases
- Subscriptions
- One-time purchases for the Mini Apps Partner Program
- Subscriptions for the Mini Apps Partner Program

Generic product IDs aren’t the same as the SKUs for products you offer in your app. Generic product IDs only contain placeholder information for prices, localizations, and subscription periods and don’t contain tax information. You provide price, localization, and tax information for each SKU when you call the Advanced Commerce APIs. For more information about SKUs, see [Creating SKUs for your In-App Purchases](creating-your-purchases.md).

> **Important**

> Send the generic product IDs you create to Apple, using the Advanced Commerce API Access form on the [Advanced Commerce API](https://developer.apple.com/in-app-purchase/advanced-commerce-api/) page.

You need one of these roles: Account Holder, Admin, App Manager, Developer, or Marketing in App Store Connect to add and edit product IDs. For more information, see [Role permissions](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/reference/role-permissions).
