## Discussion

Use this endpoint to return performance data for `ads` within your campaigns. The `orderBy` [Selector](selector.md) is required in ad-level report requests. See [ReportingAd](reportingad.md) to identify fields you can use with `orderBy`. To filter results, use selector [Condition](condition.md) operators and field values that the `ReportingAd` object specifies. You can only perform `GroupBy` on the [CountryOrRegion](countryorregion.md) field. See [ReportingRequest](reportingrequest.md).

Historical ad-level metrics for the `APPSTORE_SEARCH_TAB` placement from before API version 5.2 release are reported against `adId=-1`. For `APPSTORE_SEARCH_TAB` ad-level metrics after API version 5.2 release, all default product page ads are reported against a new, real `adId` in reporting payloads.

You can map your campaign installations by `adId` through the [AdServices](../adservices.md) attribution framework.
