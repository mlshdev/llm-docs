## Overview

Ad groups use two keyword object types: `targeting` and `negative`. Use targeting keywords to show ads according to relevant search terms people might use to find your app. Use negative keywords with campaigns and ad groups to prevent ads from showing in App Store searches.

See the Enable and Disable Search Match section of [Ad Groups](ad-groups.md) for details about how to automatically show ads for search terms relevant to your app. You can use up to 5000 targeting keywords and negative keywords per ad group, and up to 1000 keywords per API call. Keywords are case-insensitive.
