# Get all Ad Groups

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** Apple Ads  
**Kind:** Web Service Endpoint  
**Availability:** Search Ads 5.0+

Fetches all ad groups with a campaign identifier.

## URL

```http
GET https://api.searchads.apple.com/api/v5/campaigns/{campaignId}/adgroups
```

## Path Parameters

- `campaignId` — `int64` (required): The unique identifier for the campaign.

## Query Parameters

- `limit` — `int32`: The number of items to return per request. The maximum is 1000 for most objects.
  **Default:** `20`
- `offset` — `int32`: The offset pagination that limits the number of returned records. The start of each page is offset by the specified number.
  **Default:** `0`

## Response Codes

- `200` OK — `AdGroupListResponse`: If the call succeeds, the API returns the [AdGroup](adgroup.md) object in the response payload with an HTTP status code of `200(OK)`. If unsuccessful, the HTTP status code indicates the error with details in the error message.
- `401` Unauthorized — `ApiErrorResponse`: An unauthenticated call fails to get the requested response.
- `403` Forbidden — `ApiErrorResponse`: Insufficient rights to the resource.
- `404` Not Found — `ApiErrorResponse`: The API can’t locate the resource.
- `429` — `ApiErrorResponse`: The API calls exceed rate-limit thresholds. See the Rate Limits subsection of [Calling the Apple Ads API](calling-the-apple-search-ads-api.md).
- `500` Internal Server Error — `ApiErrorResponse`: The Apple Ads server is temporarily down or unreachable. The request may be valid, but you need to retry it later.

## Discussion

To return all ad groups, use the associated `campaignId` and `adgroupId` in the URI path. You can also use a partial fetch. For more information, see the Use a Partial Fetch section of [Using Apple Ads API Functionality](using-apple-search-ads-api-functionality.md).
