# AdGroupUpdate

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** Apple Ads  
**Kind:** Object  
**Availability:** Search Ads 2.0+

The list of ad group fields that are updatable.

## Declaration

```
object AdGroupUpdate
```

## Properties

- `automatedKeywordsOptIn` — `boolean`: The parameter for enabling and disabling Search Match. If `true`, the system automatically adds optimized keywords in addition to those you explicitly add to the ad group.

  See the Enable and Disable Search Match section of [Ad Groups](ad-groups.md).
- `cpaGoal` — `Money`: The cost-per-acquisition goal. Cannot be set for ad groups in `MAX_CONVERSIONS` campaigns. Returned as `null` for Max Conversions ad groups.

  > **Important**

  >  You can update the `cpaGoal` only in campaigns that use the `APPSTORE_SEARCH_RESULTS` supply source.

  This field is updatable.
- `defaultBidAmount` — `Money`: The default maximum cost-per-tap or cost-per-impression bid for the ad group.

  This field is updatable.
- `endTime` — `date-time`: The scheduled end date and time for the ad group, which the system determines from the ad group with the latest end time.

  - The `endTime` is updatable until you reach the designated time.
  - The `endTime` must be after the `startTime`.
  - The `endTime` must be in UTC.
- `name` — `string`: The unique name of the ad group. Responses don’t include deleted ad groups.

  This field is updatable.
- `startTime` — `date-time`: The scheduled start date and time for the ad group with the earliest start time in the campaign.

  - The `startTime` must be greater than the current time, and before the campaign `endTime`, if you set it.
  - If you don’t set a `startTime`, the campaign defaults to the campaign request timestamp and the `startTime` is updatable until you reach the designated time.
  - The `startTime` must be in UTC.
- `status` — `string`: The user-controlled status to enable or pause the ad group.

  This field is updatable.  
  **Allowed values:** `ENABLED`, `PAUSED`
- `targetingDimensions` — `TargetingDimensions`: The targeting criteria to narrow the audience. Targeting options include age, gender, geolocation, daypart, device, and app downloaders.

  This field is updatable.
