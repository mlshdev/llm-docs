### 5.6

Released in June, 2026

Lifetime budgets have been deprecated and the `budgetAmount` field has been removed from the API and documentation. When calling the API, use `dailyBudgetAmount`.

<a id="55"></a>

### 5.5

Released in February, 2026

Introduces Maximize Conversions, a new automated bid strategy that optimizes for the highest conversion volume at your target cost-per-acquisition (CPA). The Maximize Conversions bid strategy in a campaign uses an automated ad group with Search Match to automatically discover and bid on relevant keywords.

- To create a Maximize Conversions bid strategy campaign, see the payload example in [Create a Campaign](create-a-campaign.md).
- For details on automated ad groups, see [Ad Groups](ad-groups.md). To create an automated ad group, see the payload example in [Create an Ad Group](create-an-ad-group.md).
- To switch between manual (default) and Maximize Conversions bid strategies, see the payload examples in  [Update a Campaign](update-a-campaign.md).
- For reports with a Maximize Conversions bidding strategy, see [Get Campaign-Level Reports](get-campaign-level-reports.md) and [Get Ad Group-Level Reports](get-ad-group-level-reports.md).

### 5.4

Released in December, 2025

- New reporting metrics have been added to support App Store preorders: `tapPreOrdersPlaced`, `viewPreOrdersPlaced` and `totalPreOrdersPlaced`. See [SpendRow](spendrow.md) and [ExtendedSpendRow](extendedspendrow.md) for descriptions.

<a id="53"></a>

### 5.3

Released in August, 2025.

- The [Create a Budget Order](create-a-budget-order.md) endpoint no longer supports a single placement type. All responses to API requests you make to create new budget orders contain all possible values for [SupplySource](supplysource.md).

<a id="521"></a>

### 5.2.1

Released in May, 2025.

- The [Create a Campaign](create-a-campaign.md) endpoint supports an optional `budgetAmount` to manage the total budget of a campaign. You can only add a `budgetAmount` at the time of campaign creation. You can’t update a campaign to use `budgetAmount`. For more information, see [Campaign](campaign.md).

<a id="52"></a>

### 5.2

Released in March, 2025.

- Added endpoints to retrieve app details and localized app details. See [Get App Details](get-app-details.md) and [Get Localized App Details](get-localized-app-details.md).
- `APPSTORE_SEARCH_TAB` campaigns require that you [Create a Creative](create-a-creative.md) using either a default product page or a custom product page as the tap destination. As of API version 5.2, you need to create a default product page ad to use with `APPSTORE_SEARCH_TAB` campaigns. At the release of API version 5.2 Apple automatically creates a default product page ad for all existing, running `APPSTORE_SEARCH_TAB` campaigns. See also [CreativeType](creativetype.md).
- The [Find App Assets](find-app-assets.md) endpoint now supports default product page ads. The [Find Ad Creative Rejection Reasons](find-ad-creative-rejection-reasons.md) endpoint now supports rejection reasons related to default product pages and product page optimization.
- Added support to use custom product pages as an ad’s tap destination. `APPSTORE_SEARCH_TAB` ad-level metrics are reported through [Get Ad-Level Reports](get-ad-level-reports.md). Historical ad-level metrics (before API version 5.2 release) are reported against `adId=-1`. For ad-level metrics after API version 5.2 release, all default product page ads are reported against a new, real `adID` in reporting payloads.
- `APPSTORE_SEARCH_TAB` campaigns can optionally include a deep link. See [ProductPageDetail](productpagedetail.md).

<a id="51"></a>

### 5.1

Released in October, 2024.

- A read-only `deepLink` field has been added to the [ProductPageDetail](productpagedetail.md) response. Advertisers can add deep links to custom product pages through [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com). Retrieve your product page metadata with [Get Product Pages](get-product-pages.md) and [Get Product Pages by Identifier](get-product-pages-by-identifier.md) endpoints. Deep links are available on iOS 18 and later for Today tab and search results ads, and iPadOS 18 and later for search results ads.
- A correction has been made to the [Find Ad Groups](find-ad-groups.md) endpoint. The selector [Condition](condition.md) operator accepts only EQUALS in requests.

<a id="50"></a>

### 5.0

Released in May, 2024.

- View-through reporting metrics provide details on Apple Search Ads campaign performance. Installs, new downloads, and redownloads are available as a standalone total, tap-through, and view-through. All reports reflect the new metrics. See [SpendRow](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_ads/spendrow) and [ExtendedSpendRow](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_ads/extendedspendrow).
- Get Keyword-Level Reports and Get Keyword-Level within Ad Group Reports reflect a new suggestedBidAmount field, replacing deprecated `bidMin` and `bidMax` fields. See [KeywordBidRecommendation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_ads/keywordbidrecommendation).
- Get [Search Term-Level Reports](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_ads/gets-reports-on-search-terms-within-a-campaign.-the-information-per-campaign-is-composed-of-the-metrics,-dimensions-requested-in-the-request-parameter) and [Get Search Term-Level within Ad Group Reports](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_ads/gets-reports-on-targeting-searchterm-within-a-adgroup.-the-information-per-adgroup-is-composed-of-the-metrics,-dimensions-requested-in-the-request-parameter) require the timezone to be ORTZ.

Other new features include:

- Prior to API 5, new campaigns required a `dailyBudgetAmount` or a `budgetAmount`, or both. A `dailyBudgetAmount` is now a required field for all new campaigns. See [Create a campaign](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_ads/creates-a-campaign).
- Multiple default languages are supported for [countries or regions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_ads/countryorregion).

Deprecations:

All [Creative Sets](creative-sets.md) endpoints are deprecated and unavailable in API 5.
