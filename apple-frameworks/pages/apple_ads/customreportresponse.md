The `state` of the report needs to be `COMPLETED` for a valid URL to return when calling [Get a Single Impression Share Report](get-a-single-impression-share-report.md) or [Get All Impression Share Reports](get-all-impression-share-reports.md).

  App impressions for search terms correlate by country or region and organization against the total requests for country- or region-search term combinations. Search terms need to have more than 10 impressions per day for inclusion in a daily  Impression Share report.

  - **`searchPopularity`**: The total search volume of keyword popularity. The popularity of search terms is based on country or region. The ranking is 1–5, with 5 as the most search volume.
