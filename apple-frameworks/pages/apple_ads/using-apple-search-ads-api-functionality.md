# Using Apple Ads API Functionality

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** Apple Ads

Call endpoints using CRUD methods.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

The Apple Ads API uses a REST data model, and you use CRUD (create, read, update, delete) functions to call endpoint resources.

![Apple Ads API call structure. This image is an example of an API call, including the domain, path, and resource. In some cases, the call may also incliude a query parameter.](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.appleads/media-3697454@2x.png)

CRUD methods in the Apple Ads API include the following:

- **POST**: Creates new resources, finds resources, and pulls reports.

The API supports the use of selectors with `find` calls to filter resource data. See the [Selector](selector.md) object.

- **GET**: Reads a specific resource. Some calls use an identifier and accept `limit` and `offset` query parameters to obtain a collection of resources.

See the Use a Partial Fetch section below for query parameter functionality.

- **PUT**: Updates a specific resource or multiple resources by identifier.
- **DELETE**: Deletes a specific resource by identifier.

### Format Requests and Responses

The API uses JSON to represent the request and response payloads. Create payloads in JSON using fields, properties, and values that the API provides. Take note of the required fields.

The following is an example POST request to [Create a Campaign](create-a-campaign.md):

```json
{
    "orgId": 40669820,
    "adChannelType": "SEARCH",
    "supplySources": ["APPSTORE_SEARCH_RESULTS"],
    "billingEvent": "TAPS",  
    "name": "campaign 1",
    "dailyBudgetAmount": {
        "amount": "300", 
        "currency": "USD"
     },
    "adamId": 427916203,
    "countriesOrRegions": ["US","AU"]
}
```

A response resembles the following:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "id": 542317095,
        "orgId": 40669820,
        "name": "example campaign",
        "dailyBudgetAmount": {
            "amount": "300",
            "currency": "USD"
        },
        "adamId": 427916203,
        "paymentModel": "PAYG",
        "locInvoiceDetails": null,
        "budgetOrders": [],
        "displayStatus": "ON_HOLD",
        "adChannelType": "SEARCH",
        "supplySources": ["APPSTORE_SEARCH_RESULTS"],
        "billingEvent": "TAPS",  
        "startTime": "2024-04-08T10:33:31.650",
        "endTime": "2024-04-09T10:33:31.650",
        "status": "ENABLED",
        "servingStatus": "NOT_RUNNING",
        "servingStateReasons": [
            "AD_GROUP_MISSING"
        ],
        "modificationTime": "2024-04-08T18:21:35.133",
        "deleted": false,
        "sapinLawResponse": "NOT_ANSWERED",
        "countriesOrRegions": [
            "AU",
            "US"
        ],
        "countryOrRegionServingStateReasons": {}
    },
    "pagination": null,
    "error": null
}
```

You use the `id` that returns in the response in an endpoint URI to target a resource. In the example above,  the `id` serves as a `campaignId` throughout the API whenever making calls to that specific campaign resource. The same logic applies when you use the [Create an Ad Group](create-an-ad-group.md). The returned `id` serves as an ad group identifier (`adgroupId`) in applicable endpoints.

In other examples, when you use the [Create Targeting Keywords](create-targeting-keywords.md) and [Create Ad Group Negative Keywords](create-ad-group-negative-keywords.md) endpoints, the `id` dervies from the `campaignId` and `adgroupId` in the URI. When you use [Create Campaign Negative Keywords](create-campaign-negative-keywords.md), the `id` derives from the `campaignId` resource.

### Use Partial Updates

A partial update is updating a subset of object properties instead of the entire set of object properties. The API supports partial updates for most PUT calls. Use a campaign object envelope in your campaign request payloads. Other objects do not require a JSON envelope.

For example, the following payload is an update to the `name`, `countriesOrRegions` of a campaign:

```console
PUT https://api.searchads.apple.com/api/v5/campaigns/<campaignId>
```

```json
{
  "campaign": {
    "name": "new campaign name",
    "countriesOrRegions": [
      "US",
      "CA"
    ]
  }
}
```

<a id="Use-a-Partial-Fetch"></a>

### Use a Partial Fetch

A partial fetch indicates which properties to return in a response when fetching data. Use a partial fetch where a [Selector](selector.md) is available by using optional field parameters to limit the fields within each record that returns. Use a partial fetch with some GET endpoints by specifying the `field` query string parameter. For example, you can choose to only return the `id` for each campaign, as the following example shows:

```javascript
GET https://api.searchads.apple.com/api/v5/campaigns?fields=id,name,countriesOrRegions
```

```json
{
    "data": [
        {
            "id": 542370539,
            "name": "Multicountry campaign example 1",
            "countriesOrRegions": [
                "FR"
            ]
        },
        {
            "id": 542370549,
            "name": "Multicountry campaign example 2",
            "countriesOrRegions": [
                "GB"
            ]
        },
        {
            "id": 542370559,
            "name": "Multicountry campaign example 3",
            "countriesOrRegions": [
                "CA",
                "JP",
                "NZ",
                "AU"
            ]
        }
    ],
    "pagination": {
        "totalResults": 3,
        "startIndex": 0,
        "itemsPerPage": 20
    },
    "error": null
}
```

<a id="Use-Query-Parameters"></a>

### Use Query Parameters

You use query parameters with the [Search for iOS apps](search-for-ios-apps.md), [Search for Geolocations](search-for-geolocations.md), and `Get a List of Geolocations` endpoints by appending the query parameter to the URI in method calls.

`GET` calls use query parameters to control [Pagination](pagination.md) and to assign a limit to returned responses. You can combine these query parameters with data to fetch, such as in the following example:

```console
GET https://api.searchads.apple.com/api/v5/search/geo?entity=Locality&limit=1000
```
