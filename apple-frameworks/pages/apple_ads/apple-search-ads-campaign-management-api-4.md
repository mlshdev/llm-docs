Released in September, 2022.

Advertisers can book ads using two new ad placements: `APPSTORE_TODAY_TAB` and `APPSTORE_PRODUCT_PAGES_BROWSE`. See [SupplySource](supplysource.md).

- `APPSTORE_TODAY_TAB` requires an approved ad creative based on eligible [Custom Product Pages](custom-product-pages.md) (CPPs).
- Your CPP needs to be in the `defaultLanguage` of your campaign. See [SupplySource](supplysource.md).
- The default languages of Hong Kong (HK) and Macau (MO) have been updated from `yue-Hant` to `zh-Hant`. Use the [Get Supported Countries or Regions](get-supported-countries-or-regions.md) endpoint to fetch supported languages and language codes.
- `APPSTORE_PRODUCT_PAGES_BROWSE` places your ad at the top of the You Might Also Like list when users scroll to the bottom of relevant pages across the App Store.

<a id="OAuth"></a>

#### OAuth

Beginning in 2021, the Apple Ads Campaign Management API uses OAuth 2 for API account authentication. Apple Search Ads users no longer use API certificates to manage access to their Search Ads accounts. For more information, see [Implementing OAuth for the Apple Ads API](implementing-oauth-for-the-apple-search-ads-api.md).

To make calls to the Apple Search Ads Campaign Management API with OAuth, see [Calling the Apple Ads API](calling-the-apple-search-ads-api.md).

<a id="Access-Control-Lists"></a>

#### Access Control Lists

Access control lists have the following updates:

- The `parentOrgId` field is a new field in the [UserAcl](useracl.md) object. This distinguishes the account from an `orgId` belonging to a suborganization. See [Calling the Apple Ads API](calling-the-apple-search-ads-api.md) for details.
- The [Get Me Details](get-me-details.md) endpoint has been added with its [MeDetailResponse](medetailresponse.md) object.

<a id="Reports"></a>

#### Reports

[Campaign](campaign.md) objects now include new fields: [SupplySource](supplysource.md), [AdChannelType](adchanneltype.md), and [BillingEventType](billingeventtype.md). The [AdGroup](adgroup.md) object now includes a new field: [PricingModel](pricingmodel.md).  Note, in the [AdGroup](adgroup.md) object, the `defaultCpcBid` field used in API 3 is now the `defaultBidAmount` field in API 4.

- [Get Campaign-Level Reports](get-campaign-level-reports.md) returns `supplySources`,  [AdChannelType](adchanneltype.md), `BillingEventType`, and `avgCPM` in the metadata.
- [Get Ad Group-Level Reports](get-ad-group-level-reports.md) returns `PricingModel`, `defaultBidAmount`, and `avgCPM` in the metadata.
