  - **`Auto`**: Specifies the system serves impressions with optimized keywords, in addition to those you explicitly add to the ad group.
  - **`Broad`**: Ensures your ads don’t run on relevant, close variants of a keyword, such as singulars, plurals, misspellings, synonyms, related searches, and phrases that include that term (fully or partially).
  - **`Exact`**: Offers the most control over searches  your ad may appear in. You can target a specific term and its close variants, such as common misspellings and plurals.
