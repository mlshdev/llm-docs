## Overview

> **Note**

>  As of February 2021, Apple no longer supports the Apple Ads Campaign Management API 2. A 301 RESOURCE_MOVED_PERMANENTLY error occurs if you use an API 2 endpoint. API usage requires version 3 or later.

The Apple Ads API 2 broadens international support by allowing advertisers to include multiple countries or regions within a single campaign.

API 2 campaigns aren’t compatible with API 3 resources, however, API 2 reports are forward-compatible. Negative keywords and ad groups were decoupled from the campaign object. Negative keywords and targeting keywords were decoupled from ad groups.

The API now represents App Store territories as follows:

- **`countriesOrRegions`**: For use in the [Campaign](campaign.md) object.
- **`countriesOrRegions`**: For use in the [ReportingCampaign](reportingcampaign.md) object.
- **[CountryOrRegion](countryorregion.md)**: For use as a `groupBy` dimension in the [ReportingRequest](reportingrequest.md) object.

Report field changes are as follows:

| **API 2 report field** | **API 1 report field** |
| --- | --- |
| `installs` | `conversions` |
| `latOnInstalls` | `conversionsLATOn` |
| `latOffInstalls` | `conversionsLATOff` |
| `newDownloads` | `conversionsNewDownloads` |
| `redownloads` | `conversionsRedownloads` |

See [ExtendedSpendRow](extendedspendrow.md) and [SpendRow](spendrow.md) for field descriptions.

API 2 includes the following new features for [Creative Sets](creative-sets.md):

- Creating new Creative Sets and linking to an ad group.
- Reassigning Creative Sets to an ad group.
- Retrieving associated app assets for Creative Sets in campaigns.
- Deleting associated Creative Sets for ad groups.

The following Apple Ads Campaign Management API 1 fields are no longer in the corresponding API object and don’t apply to API 2 and later:

- **`referenceLabel`**: `Campaign object`
- **`locInvoiceDetails.billingContactName`**: `Campaign object`
- **`ageCriteria.excluded`**: `TargetingDimensions object`
- **`genderCriteria.excluded`**: `TargetingDimensions object`
- **`adminAreaCriteria.excluded`**: `TargetingDimensions object`
- **`localityCriteria.excluded`**: `TargetingDimensions object`
- **`deviceClassCriteria.excluded`**: `TargetingDimensions object`
- **`daypartCriteria.userTime.excluded`**: `TargetingDimensions object`
