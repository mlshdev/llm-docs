## Overview

> **Note**

> SiriKit, Intents, and IntentsUI frameworks continue to provide legacy support for Shortcuts actions, widget configuration, and most existing Siri interactions. To implement modern support for these features and integrate your app with Apple Intelligence and Siri AI, use the [App Intents](appintents.md) framework.

Intents is a [SiriKit](sirikit.md) framework you use to support interactions with Siri, Shortcuts, and widgets. Define custom intents for specific actions that someone can trigger with Siri or Shortcuts, and donate intents to help Siri learn someone’s habits and suggest relevant shortcuts over time. You can also provide shortcut suggestions that appear in the Shortcuts app or in Siri’s recommendations to help boost discoverability.
