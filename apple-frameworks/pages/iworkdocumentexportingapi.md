<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

The iWork API enables the conversion of iWork documents from apps such as Numbers, Pages, and Keynote into PDF documents that a person can view using the Preview app or another PDF reader application.

Once the service exports an iWork document to PDF format, an app can use the PDF to display an inline preview for iWork documents. You can extract Text and preview images from the PDF document using standard tools.

The conversion service supports files that meet the following criteria:

- A maximum file size of 1 GB.
- Documents that aren’t protected with a password.

> **Important**

> As part of your uploading workflow, inform people that the service temporarily stores iWork documents on Apple servers for the purpose of conversion. Provide the option to enable and disable the iWork preview feature, and display a privacy notice such as “When using iWork online previews, your files will be temporarily stored on Apple servers.”

To convert iWork documents to PDF files using the iWork document-exporting service, sign up by generating the keys and service identifier the service requires. This process consists of several steps that you need to perform in the order described below.

### Log in to the developer portal

Log into the developer portal by accessing [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com) using your Apple Developer ID. After logging in, click on the Identifiers item in the Certificates, IDs & Profiles section.

Make note of your developer team ID, located under your account name in the upper-right corner of the window; the service requires this value when making calls to the service API.
