# IOUserSCSIParallelInterfaceController

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** SCSIControllerDriverKit  
**Kind:** Class  
**Availability:** DriverKit

A DriverKit provider object that manages communications with SCSI-based devices.

## Declaration

```objectivec
class IOUserSCSIParallelInterfaceController;
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Implement your driver by subclassing this class and overriding all pure virtual methods.

The DriverKit framework starts the `Default` dispatch queue. The system expects your dext to create two additional dispatch queues, named `AuxiliaryQueue` and `InterruptQueue`. The [UserCreateTargetForID](iouserscsiparallelinterfacecontroller/usercreatetargetforid.md) method uses the `AuxiliaryQueue` to avoid deadlock during start and initialization.

The framework invokes the dext class’s [Start](../driverkit/ioservice/start.md) and other methods to initialize the SCSI controller. Because these calls occur during DriverKit’s matching, it’s important to complete them quickly, to prevent keeping `IORegsitry` in a busy state for a long time. In some cases, probing the media may take a long time and delay the initialization, especially when working with HDDs. Defer these tasks if they take a long time to complete.

The framework provides the [UserReportHBAConstraints](iouserscsiparallelinterfacecontroller/userreporthbaconstraints.md) API to report controller I/O constraints. Make sure your dext reports these constraints accurately — particularly all mandatory keys — during initialization. This helps prevent intermittent failures, such as controller firmware buffer overflows.

## Support power capabilities

IOUserSCSIParallelInterfaceController supports the following power capabilities:

- [kIOServicePowerCapabilityOff](../driverkit/kioservicepowercapabilityoff.md)
- [kIOServicePowerCapabilityOn](../driverkit/kioservicepowercapabilityon.md)
- [kIOServicePowerCapabilityPause](kioservicepowercapabilitypause.md)

Implement the [SetPowerState](../driverkit/ioservice/setpowerstate.md) method in your service object and use it to put your driver in a safe state for the new power setting. Call `super` either as the last step in your implementation, or when the dext is ready to acknowledge the power state transition.

The following code example implements [SetPowerState](../driverkit/ioservice/setpowerstate.md) by performing a check to see if the new state is [kIOServicePowerCapabilityOn](../driverkit/kioservicepowercapabilityon.md). If it is, the implementation calls a private `IssueHardReset()` method.

```objc
kern_return_t
IMPL ( ExampleSCSIDext, SetPowerState )
{
    
    kern_return_t ret = kIOReturnError;

    …

    if ( powerState == kIOServicePowerCapabilityOn )
    {
        ret = IssueHardReset ( );
 
        ivars->fCurrentPowerState = kIOServicePowerCapabilityOn;
    }

    return ret;

}
```

The hypothetical driver in this example still needs to acknowledge the power state change when it’s appropriate. For example, it can ensure a rescan brought up all its targets, and then call `SetPowerState ( powerState, SUPERDISPATCH );`.
