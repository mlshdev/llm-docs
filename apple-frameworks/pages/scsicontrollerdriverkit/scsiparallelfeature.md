# SCSIParallelFeature

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** SCSIControllerDriverKit  
**Kind:** Enumeration  
**Availability:** DriverKit

A feature that the driver extension supports.

## Declaration

```objectivec
typedef enum SCSIParallelFeature : unsigned int { ... } SCSIParallelFeature;
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

This enumeration defines feature selectors the framework uses to identify features of the SCSI parallel interface. The [UserDoesHBASupportSCSIParallelFeature](iouserscsiparallelinterfacecontroller/userdoeshbasupportscsiparallelfeature.md) function uses these to report whether the HBA supports a SCSI parallel interface feature. The framework also uses these to request negotiation and report negotiation results between the controller and the device.

## Topics

### Feature selectors

- [kSCSIParallelFeature_WideDataTransfer](scsiparallelfeature/kscsiparallelfeature_widedatatransfer.md): The selector for support of wide data transfers.
- [kSCSIParallelFeature_SynchronousDataTransfer](scsiparallelfeature/kscsiparallelfeature_synchronousdatatransfer.md): The selector for support of synchronous data transfers.
- [kSCSIParallelFeature_QuickArbitrationAndSelection](scsiparallelfeature/kscsiparallelfeature_quickarbitrationandselection.md): The selector for support of quick arbitration and selection (QAS).
- [kSCSIParallelFeature_DoubleTransitionDataTransfers](scsiparallelfeature/kscsiparallelfeature_doubletransitiondatatransfers.md): The selector for support of double transition (DT) data transfers.
- [kSCSIParallelFeature_InformationUnitTransfers](scsiparallelfeature/kscsiparallelfeature_informationunittransfers.md): The selector for SPI information unit (IU) transfers.
- [kSCSIParallelFeature_TotalFeatureCount](scsiparallelfeature/kscsiparallelfeature_totalfeaturecount.md): The total number of supported features.
