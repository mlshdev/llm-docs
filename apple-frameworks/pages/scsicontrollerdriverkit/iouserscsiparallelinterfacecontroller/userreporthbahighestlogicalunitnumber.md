# UserReportHBAHighestLogicalUnitNumber

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** SCSIControllerDriverKit  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** DriverKit

Gets the highest logical unit number (LUN) in response to a call from the framework.

## Declaration

```objectivec
virtual kern_return_t UserReportHBAHighestLogicalUnitNumber(uint64_t *value);
```

## Parameters

- `value`: A pointer to a `uint64_t` value. On return, set this value to the highest LUN the controller can address.

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

A value that indicates the result of determining the highest LUN. [kIOReturnSuccess](../../driverkit/kioreturnsuccess.md) indicates success. For error definitions, see [IOKit Constants](../../iokit/iokit_constants.md).

## Discussion

The framework calls this method to query the driver extension class to determine the highest logical unit number that the controller can address.
