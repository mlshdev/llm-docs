# peripheralManager(\_:didReceiveWrite:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Bluetooth  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 6.0+ · iPadOS 6.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.9+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

Tells the delegate that a local peripheral device received an Attribute Protocol (ATT) write request for a characteristic with a dynamic value.

## Declaration

```swift
optional func peripheralManager(_ peripheral: CBPeripheralManager, didReceiveWrite requests: [CBATTRequest])
```

## Parameters

- `peripheral`: The peripheral manager that received the request.
- `requests`: A list of one or more [CBATTRequest](../cbattrequest.md) objects, each representing a request to write the value of a characteristic.

## Discussion

In the same way that you respond to a read request, each time you receive this callback, call the [respond(to:withResult:)](../cbperipheralmanager/respond%28to_withresult_%29.md) method of the [CBPeripheralManager](../cbperipheralmanager.md) class exactly once. If the `requests` parameter contains multiple requests, treat them as you would a single request—if you can’t fulfill an individual request, you shouldn’t fulfill any of them. Instead, call the [respond(to:withResult:)](../cbperipheralmanager/respond%28to_withresult_%29.md) method immediately, and provide a result that indicates the cause of the failure.

When you respond to a write request, note that the first parameter of the [respond(to:withResult:)](../cbperipheralmanager/respond%28to_withresult_%29.md) method expects a single [CBATTRequest](../cbattrequest.md) object, even though you received an array of them from the [peripheralManager(\_:didReceiveWrite:)](peripheralmanager%28__didreceivewrite_%29.md) method. To respond properly, pass in the first request of the `requests` array.
