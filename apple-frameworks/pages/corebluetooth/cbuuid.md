# CBUUID (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Bluetooth  
**Kind:** Class  
**Availability:** iOS 5.0+ · iPadOS 5.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.7+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

A universally unique identifier, as defined by Bluetooth standards.

## Declaration

```swift
class CBUUID
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Instances of the [CBUUID](cbuuid.md) class represent the 128-bit universally unique identifiers (UUIDs) of attributes used in Bluetooth low energy communication, such as a peripheral’s services, characteristics, and descriptors. This class provides a number of factory methods for dealing with long UUIDs when developing your app. For example, instead of passing around the string representation of a 128-bit Bluetooth low energy attribute in your code, you can create a [CBUUID](cbuuid.md) object that represents it, and pass that around instead.

The Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) publishes a list of commonly-used UUIDs, many of which are 16- or 32-bits for convenience. The [CBUUID](cbuuid.md) class provides methods that automatically transform these predefined shorter UUIDs into their 128-bit equivalent UUIDs. When you create a [CBUUID](cbuuid.md) object from a predefined 16- or 32-bit UUID, Core Bluetooth pre-fills the rest of the 128-bit UUID with the Bluetooth base UUID, as defined in the Bluetooth 4.0 specification, Volume 3, Part F, Section 3.2.1.

In addition to providing methods for creating [CBUUID](cbuuid.md) objects, this class defines constants that represent the UUIDs of the Bluetooth-defined characteristic descriptors, as defined in the Bluetooth 4.0 specification, Volume 3, Part G, Section 3.3.3.

## Topics

### Creating New CBUUID Objects

- [init(string:)](cbuuid/init%28string_%29.md): Creates a Core Bluetooth UUID object from a 16-, 32-, or 128-bit UUID string.
- [init(data:)](cbuuid/init%28data_%29.md): Creates a Core Bluetooth UUID object from a 16-, 32-, or 128-bit UUID data container.
- [init(cfuuid:)](cbuuid/init%28cfuuid_%29-3h0ry.md): Deprecated. Creates a Core Bluetooth UUID object from a Core Foundation UUID object.
- [init(nsuuid:)](cbuuid/init%28nsuuid_%29-2amob.md): Creates a Core Bluetooth UUID object from a Foundation UUID object.

### Inspecting CBUUID Properties

- [data](cbuuid/data.md): The data of the UUID.
- [uuidString](cbuuid/uuidstring.md): The UUID represented as a string.

### UUID Constants

- [Characteristic Descriptors](characteristic-descriptors.md): Values that represent the UUIDs of the characteristic descriptors.

### Initializers

- [init(CFUUID:)](cbuuid/init%28cfuuid_%29-9ehvy.md): Deprecated.
- [init(NSUUID:)](cbuuid/init%28nsuuid_%29-hoyn.md)
