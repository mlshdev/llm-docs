# Reporting corrections

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** External Purchase Server API  
**Kind:** Article

Submit a report with corrections if you find errors in, or have adjustments to, a successfully submitted transaction.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

If you successfully submit a report to the [Send External Purchase Report](send-external-purchase-report.md) endpoint that you later find to be incorrect, you must correct your submission. To send a correction, fill out the [ExternalPurchaseReport](externalpurchasereport.md) request body with a new [requestIdentifier](requestidentifier.md) and the corrections, and call the [Send External Purchase Report](send-external-purchase-report.md) endpoint. Send corrected reports promptly.

There are two types of corrections:

- A correction to transaction data in a line item. In this type of correction, you restate the entire line item with corrected data. Apple uses only the most recent submission for the line item.
- A retraction of a line item you previously sent. In this type of correction, you indicate that you erroneously sent the line item, and aren’t including the erroneously-submitted amounts in transaction calculations. Be sure to update the [netAmountTaxExclusive](netamounttaxexclusive.md) field so it represents the correct net amount, tax exclusive, of the transaction.

> **Important**

> The [netAmountTaxExclusive](netamounttaxexclusive.md) must represent the correct net amount (excluding taxes) for the transaction, including in line items that are corrections.

### Correct data in a line item

To submit a line item with corrections, use the line item’s original [lineItemId](lineitemid.md) and include the [restatement](restatement.md) flag set to `true`. Make corrections to any type of line item: [OneTimeBuyLineItem](onetimebuylineitem.md), [SubscriptionBuyLineItem](subscriptionbuylineitem.md), and [RefundLineItem](refundlineitem.md).

> **Important**

> Restated line items overwrite the originally reported line item. Include all the data in the line item — even fields that are the same as the previous version.

Apple uses only the most recent version of the line item.

### Retract an erroneously submitted line item

If you submitted a line item in error and want Apple to ignore it, use the same [lineItemId](lineitemid.md) as in the original submission. Set both the [restatement](restatement.md) and [erroneouslySubmitted](erroneouslysubmitted.md) fields to `true`. (You may undo this action by submitting the line item again, with [restatement](restatement.md) set to `true`, and [erroneouslySubmitted](erroneouslysubmitted.md) set to false.) Be sure to include all of the original line item data fields, and recalculate the [netAmountTaxExclusive](netamounttaxexclusive.md) field to correctly represent the net amount with the erroneously submitted line item accounted for.

Successfully submitting a line item with the `erroneouslySubmitted` flag is an effective “undo” of the original line item.
