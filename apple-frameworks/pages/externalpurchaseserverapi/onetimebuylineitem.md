## Discussion

Use a `OneTimeBuyLineItem` to report a one-time charge transaction, or a correction to a one-time charge transaction that you previously submitted.

Each line-item object represents one transaction. Other types of line-item objects include:

- [SubscriptionBuyLineItem](subscriptionbuylineitem.md), for reporting subscription-related transactions
- [RefundLineItem](refundlineitem.md), for reporting refunds

Include the line-item objects in the `lineItems` array of an [ExternalPurchaseReport](externalpurchasereport.md) object. To send the report, include the [ExternalPurchaseReport](externalpurchasereport.md) object in a request to the [Send External Purchase Report](send-external-purchase-report.md) endpoint.

For more information, see [Reporting tokens with transactions](reportwithtransactions.md) and [Reporting corrections](reportcorrections.md).
