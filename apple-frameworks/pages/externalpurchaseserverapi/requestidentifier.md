## Discussion

You generate this identifier when you send a report to the [Send External Purchase Report](send-external-purchase-report.md) endpoint. Use the same `requestIdentifier` only if you resubmit a report that previously failed. Use a new `requestIdentifier` for each new report, including for reports that correct line items you previously submitted successfully.

Use the `requestIdentifier` to get the report from the [Retrieve External Purchase Report](retrieve-external-purchase-report.md) endpoint.
