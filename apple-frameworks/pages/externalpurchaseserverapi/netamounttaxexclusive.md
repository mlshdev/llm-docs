## Discussion

Include this property in the line item to state the net amount in milli-units that you charged the customer, pre-tax, after you account for all refunds and restatements.

Provide all amount field values in milli-units of the currency you state in the [reportingCurrency](reportingcurrency.md) field. One unit of the currency equals 1000 milli-units. For example, if the amount is `€2.99`, the amount in milli-units is `2990`.

To calculate the [netAmountTaxExclusive](netamounttaxexclusive.md), subtract the refund amount excluding taxes from the original [amountTaxExclusive](amounttaxexclusive.md) value or from the amount you provided in a restatement, if any.

For example: A customer makes an initial purchase for the pre-tax amount [amountTaxExclusive](amounttaxexclusive.md) of 1000. They receive a refund of 300. The [netAmountTaxExclusive](netamounttaxexclusive.md) is 700 (which is the original price, 1000, minus the refund of 300).

If you then submit a restatement of the original purchase price to 800, you calculate the [netAmountTaxExclusive](netamounttaxexclusive.md) to be 500, which is the restated price, 800, minus the refund of 300.

This value is used for data validation.
