## Discussion

Use a `SubscriptionBuyLineItem` to report a subscription-related transaction or event, or a correction to the same.

Each line-item object represents one transaction. Other types of line-item objects include:

- [OneTimeBuyLineItem](onetimebuylineitem.md), for reporting a one-time charge
- [RefundLineItem](refundlineitem.md), for reporting refunds

Include the line-item objects in the `lineItems` array of an [ExternalPurchaseReport](externalpurchasereport.md) object. To send the report, include the [ExternalPurchaseReport](externalpurchasereport.md) object in a request to the [Send External Purchase Report](send-external-purchase-report.md) endpoint.

> **Note**

> Identify a subscription using the [lineItemId](lineitemid.md) of the original subscription-start transaction. A line item for a subscription start has an [eventType](eventtype.md) of `BUY` and a [subscriptionEvent](subscriptionevent.md) of `SUBSCRIPTION_START`.

For example, to report a renewal for a subscription, set the renewal transaction’s [referenceLineItemId](referencelineitemid.md) to the `lineItemId` of the subscription-start line item, and set the  `subscriptionEvent` to `RENEWAL`.
