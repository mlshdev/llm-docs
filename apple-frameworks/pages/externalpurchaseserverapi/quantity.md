## Discussion

The `quantity` field applies only to purchases. Don’t include a `quantity` for refunds.

Set `quantity` to `1` when a customer purchases a single product. Use a value greater than `1` when someone purchases a multiple of the same product in one transaction.

> **Important**

> Amount values always represent the total amount for the line item, not a per-item amount. The `quantity` value is not used for calculations.

Multiple items may be considered a single product if they are sold as a package. For example, a 10-pack of game gems may be a single product with a quantity of `1`.

If the [productType](producttype.md) is `SUBSCRIPTION`, use a `quantity` greater than `1` to indicate a purchase of multiple subscriptions that renew as one, for example, a multi-seat subscription. If subscriptions can have different billing dates or renewal schedules, report them as separate line items with a `quantity` of `1`.
