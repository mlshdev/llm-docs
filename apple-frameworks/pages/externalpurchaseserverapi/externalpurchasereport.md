## Discussion

This object is the request body for the [Send External Purchase Report](send-external-purchase-report.md) endpoint. Populate this object with data about a single external purchase token that you’re reporting, including its transactions. The [Retrieve External Purchase Report](retrieve-external-purchase-report.md) endpoint also returns this object when you request a report you previously successfully submitted.

The `requestIdentifier` field identifies the report. Generate a UUID for each report you send.

> **Tip**

> Store the [requestIdentifier](requestidentifier.md) value in your records with the external purchase token to identify your reports.

The [externalPurchaseId](externalpurchaseid.md) field is the token’s identifier. To get that value, decode the external purchase token you receive in your app or on your website. For more information, see [Receiving and decoding external purchase tokens](../storekit/receiving-and-decoding-external-purchase-tokens.md).

The [status](status.md) field represents the token’s status, which you provide to indicate the report’s contents and whether it includes a `lineItems` array. The [status](status.md) value determines the type of report you send:

- Use a `LINE_ITEM` status to report a token with transactions that you list in the `lineItems` array.  Use this status when a token has associated transactions, and to send corrections to previously submitted line items. For more information, see [Reporting tokens with transactions](reportwithtransactions.md).
- Use a `NO_LINE_ITEM` status for a report of a token that didn’t result in any successful transactions. Don’t include `lineItems` in the request with this status.  For more information, see [Reporting unrecognized and transactionless tokens](reportwithouttransactions.md).
- Use an `UNRECOGNIZED_TOKEN` status to report a token you receive in an App Store Server Notification, but that you don’t have recorded in your system. Don’t include `lineItems` in the request with this status. For more information, see [Reporting unrecognized and transactionless tokens](reportwithouttransactions.md).
- Use a `DUPLICATE_TOKEN` status to report a `SERVICES` or `ACQUISITION` token that you recognize, but which you aren’t using to report transactions because it’s a duplicate token. Don’t include `lineItems` in the request with this status. For more information, see [Reporting unrecognized and transactionless tokens](reportwithouttransactions.md).

You can also submit corrections to restate line items, or retract a previous submission. For more information, see [Reporting corrections](reportcorrections.md).

A line item represents each transaction for the token identified by the `externalPurchaseId`. There are three types of line items:

- [OneTimeBuyLineItem](onetimebuylineitem.md), for one-time charges
- [RefundLineItem](refundlineitem.md), for refunds
- [SubscriptionBuyLineItem](subscriptionbuylineitem.md), for auto-renewable subscription events and transactions

Include as many line items as there are transactions that apply to the token. If your system completes new transactions after you successfully submit a report for a token, send a new report for the token with the new transactions.
