## Discussion

- requirement: The requirement the peer must have

> **Note**

> The session must be inactive to set a peer requirement. It is a programming error to call multiple of the `setPeerRequirement` method on the same session.

> **Note**

> All messages received on this session will be checked to ensure that they come from a peer who satisfies the requirement. When a reply is expected on the session and the peer does not satisfy the requirement, the session will be canceled and user’s cancelation handler will be invoked with `XPCRichError` describing the code signing error.
