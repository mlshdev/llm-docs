# xpc_activity_should_defer(\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** XPC  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** macOS 10.9+

Tests whether to defer an activity.

## Declaration

```swift
func xpc_activity_should_defer(_ activity: xpc_activity_t) -> Bool
```

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

Returns true if the activity should be deferred.

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

Use this function to test whether the criteria of a long-running activity are still satisfied. If not, the system indicates that the application should defer the activity. The application may acknowledge the deferral by calling [xpc_activity_set_state(\_:\_:)](xpc_activity_set_state%28____%29.md) with [XPC_ACTIVITY_STATE_DEFER](xpc_activity_state_defer.md). Once deferred, the system places the activity back into the WAIT state and invokes the handler block again at the earliest opportunity when the criteria are once again satisfied.
