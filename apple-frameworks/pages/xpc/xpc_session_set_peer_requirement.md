## Discussion

Requires that the session peer satisfies a requirement.

It is a programming error to call `xpc_session_set_peer_*requirement` more than once per session.

All messages received on this session will be checked to ensure they come from a peer who satisfies the requirement. When a reply is expected on the session and the peer does not satisfy the requirement, the session will be canceled with cancellation handler called with a rich error describing the peer code signing error. For `xpc_session_send_message_with_reply_sync` NULL will be returned instead of reply, with `error_out` (if set) pointing to the rich error describing the peer code signing error.
