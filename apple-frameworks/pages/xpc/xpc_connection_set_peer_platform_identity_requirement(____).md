# xpc_connection_set_peer_platform_identity_requirement(\_:\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** XPC  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** iOS 17.4+ · iPadOS 17.4+ · Mac Catalyst 17.4+ · macOS 14.4+ · tvOS 17.4+ · visionOS 1.1+ · watchOS 10.4+

Sets a requirement that the executable for the peer process has a valid code signature that identifies it as an Apple-signed binary with the given signing identifier.

## Declaration

```swift
func xpc_connection_set_peer_platform_identity_requirement(_ connection: xpc_connection_t, _ signing_identifier: UnsafePointer<CChar>?) -> Int32
```

## Parameters

- `connection`: The XPC connection.
- `signing_identifier`: The code-signing identifier for the peer process’s executable. This value is typically a Bundle ID for apps and extensions. Pass `NULL` to indicate that any Apple-signed binary is acceptable.

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

On success, `0`. Otherwise, a value from [Errors](xpc-connections.md#Errors).

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

When you set this requirement on a connection, the operating system checks that peer process satisfies the requirement every time it sends a message to your process. If the peer process initiated the connection and its executable doesn’t satisfy the lightweight code requirement, then you don’t receive a message and the operating system doesn’t call your event handler. If your process sent a message to its peer expecting a reply, and its executable doesn’t have the requested entitlement, then you don’t receive a reply and the operating system delivers [XPC_ERROR_PEER_CODE_SIGNING_REQUIREMENT](xpc_error_peer_code_signing_requirement-c.macro.md) instead.

> **Important**

>  It’s an error to call this function multiple times for the same connection, or to call multiple functions that set code-signing requirements on the same connection. If you do, then the operating system terminates your process.
