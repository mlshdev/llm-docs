# vAEBuildAppleEvent(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Services  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** macOS 10.0+

Allows you to encapsulate calls to `AEBuildAppleEvent` in a wrapper routine.

## Declaration

```swift
func vAEBuildAppleEvent(_ theClass: AEEventClass, _ theID: AEEventID, _ addressType: DescType, _ addressData: UnsafeRawPointer!, _ addressLength: Size, _ returnID: Int16, _ transactionID: Int32, _ resultEvt: UnsafeMutablePointer<AppleEvent>!, _ error: UnsafeMutablePointer<AEBuildError>!, _ paramsFmt: UnsafePointer<CChar>!, _ args: CVaListPointer) -> OSStatus
```

## Parameters

- `theClass`: The event class for the resulting Apple event. See [AEEventClass](aeeventclass.md).
- `theID`: The event id for the resulting Apple event. See [AEEventID](aeeventid.md).
- `addressType`: The address type for the addressing information described in the next two parameters: usually one of `typeApplSignature`, `typeProcessSerialNumber`, or `typeKernelProcessID`. See [DescType](desctype.md).
- `addressData`: A pointer to the address information.
- `addressLength`: The number of bytes pointed to by the `addressData` parameter.
- `returnID`: The return ID for the created Apple event. If you pass a value of `kAutoGenerateReturnID`, the Apple Event Manager assigns the created Apple event a return ID that is unique to the current session. If you pass any other value, the Apple Event Manager assigns that value for the ID.
- `transactionID`: The transaction ID for this Apple event. A transaction is a sequence of Apple events that are sent back and forth between the client and server applications, beginning with the client’s initial request for a service. All Apple events that are part of a transaction must have the same transaction ID. You can specify the `kAnyTransactionID` constant if the Apple event is not one of a series of interdependent Apple events.
- `result`: A pointer to a descriptor where the resulting descriptor should be stored. See [AppleEvent](appleevent.md) for a description of the data type.
- `error`: A pointer to an `AEBuildError` structure where additional information about any errors that occur will be saved. This is an optional parameter and you can pass `NULL` if this information is not required. See [AEBuildErrorCode](aebuilderrorcode.md) for the syntax error codes that can be returned in this structure.
- `paramsFmt`: An AEBuild format string describing the AppleEvent record to be created. The format of these strings is described in Technical Note TN2106, [AEBuild\*, AEPrint\*, and Friends](http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn/tn2045.html).
- `args`: A variable array of arguments to be substituted into the `paramsFmt` format string. See the ANSI C Interfaces documentation for a description of the `va_list` data type.

## Discussion

Passing an argument list to `vAEBuildAppleEvent` corresponds to passing a series of individual parameters to the [AEBuildAppleEvent](1573757-aebuildappleevent.md) function.

This function and related “AEBuild” routines provide a very simple translation service for converting specially formatted strings into complex Apple event descriptors. Normally, creating complex Apple event descriptors requires a large number of calls to Apple event Manager routines to build up the descriptor piece by piece. The `vAEBuildAppleEvent` function and related routines allow you to consolidate all of the calls required to construct a complex Apple event descriptor into a single system call that creates the desired structure as directed by a format string that you provide.
