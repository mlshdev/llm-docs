## Discussion

If the bit specified by this mask is set, boundaries of character clusters may be located. A cluster is a group of characters that should be treated as single text element for editing operations such as cursor movement. Typically this includes groups such as a base character followed by a sequence of combining characters, for example, a Hangul syllable represented as a sequence of conjoining jamo characters or an Indic consonant cluster.
