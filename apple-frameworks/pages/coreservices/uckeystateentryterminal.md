# UCKeyStateEntryTerminal (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Services  
**Kind:** Structure  
**Availability:** Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.0+

Maps from a dead-key state to the Unicode character(s) produced when that state is terminated by a given character key for a `'uchr'` resource.

## Declaration

```swift
struct UCKeyStateEntryTerminal
```

## Overview

The `UCKeyStateEntryTerminal` type is used in the `stateEntryData[]` field of a structure of type  [UCKeyStateRecord](uckeystaterecord.md). You should use the `UCKeyStateEntryTerminal` format for simple dead-key states that are terminated by a single keystroke, as in the U.S. keyboard layout. Each entry maps from the current dead-key state to the Unicode character(s) produced when a given character key is pressed that terminates the dead-key state.

## Topics

### Initializers

- [init()](uckeystateentryterminal/1443469-init.md)
- [init(curState:charData:)](uckeystateentryterminal/1446872-init.md)

### Instance Properties

- [charData](uckeystateentryterminal/1390590-chardata.md): A value of type `UCKeyCharSeq` specifying the Unicode character(s) produced when a given character key is pressed.
- [curState](uckeystateentryterminal/1390480-curstate.md): An unsigned 16-bit integer specifying the current dead-key state.
