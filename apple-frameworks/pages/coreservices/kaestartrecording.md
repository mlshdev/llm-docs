## Discussion

Event ID for an event by a scripting component to the recording process (or to any running process on the local computer), but handled by the Apple Event Manager. The Apple Event Manager responds by turning on recording and sending a r`ecordingon` event to all running processes on the local computer. 

If sent by process serial number (PSN), this event must be addressed using a real PSN; it should never be sent to an address specified as `kCurrentProcess`.
