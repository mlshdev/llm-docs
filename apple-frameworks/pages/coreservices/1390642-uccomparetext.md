# UCCompareText(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Services  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** macOS 10.0+

Uses locale-specific collation information to compare Unicode strings.

## Declaration

```swift
func UCCompareText(_ collatorRef: CollatorRef!, _ text1Ptr: UnsafePointer<UniChar>!, _ text1Length: Int, _ text2Ptr: UnsafePointer<UniChar>!, _ text2Length: Int, _ equivalent: UnsafeMutablePointer<DarwinBoolean>!, _ order: UnsafeMutablePointer<Int32>!) -> OSStatus
```

## Parameters

- `collatorRef`: A valid reference to a collator object; `NULL` is not allowed. You can use the function [UCCreateCollator(\_:\_:\_:\_:)](1390403-uccreatecollator.md) to obtain a collator reference.
- `text1Ptr`: A pointer to the first Unicode string (a `UniChar` array) to compare.
- `text1Length`: The total count of Unicode characters in the first string being compared.
- `text2Ptr`: A pointer to the second Unicode string to compare.
- `text2Length`: The total count of Unicode characters in the second string being compared.
- `equivalent`: A pointer to a `Boolean` value or `NULL`. On return, `UCCompareText` produces a value of `true` if the strings are equivalent for the options you have specified in the collator object. If you wish simply to sort a list of strings in order, using your specified options, you can pass `NULL` for the `equivalent` parameter and only use the `order` parameter’s result. In this case, all available comparison criteria are used to put the strings in a deterministic order, even if they are considered “equivalent” for the options you have specified. Note that you can set either the `equivalent` or the `order` parameters to `NULL`, but not both.
- `order`: A pointer to a signed, 32-bit integer value, or pass `NULL`. If you wish simply to test strings for equivalence, using your specified options (which can be much faster than determining ordering), you can pass `NULL` for the `order` parameter and only use the `equivalent` parameter’s result. (Note that either the `equivalent` or the `order` parameters may be `NULL`, but not both.

## Return Value

A result code.  The function can return `paramErr` (for example, if `collatorRef`, `text1Ptr`, or `text2Ptr` are `NULL`.

## Discussion

You can use the `UCCompareText` function to perform various types of string comparison for a given set of locale and collation specifications. You can

-  simply test whether two strings are equivalent 
-  determine the relative ordering of two strings 
-  check whether a given string is equivalent to any string in an ordered list 

You can also call the `UCCompareText` function multiple times to compare different strings using the same collator object. If you wish to compare the same strings several times, as when sorting a list of strings, it may be more efficient for you to derive a collation key for each string and then compare the collation keys. For more on comparison using collation keys, see the functions  [UCGetCollationKey(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:)](1390468-ucgetcollationkey.md)  and  [UCCompareCollationKeys(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:)](1390378-uccomparecollationkeys.md).

# UCCompareText (Objective-C)

**Framework:** Core Services  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** macOS 10.0+

Uses locale-specific collation information to compare Unicode strings.

## Declaration

```objectivec
OSStatus UCCompareText(CollatorRef collatorRef, const UniChar *text1Ptr, UniCharCount text1Length, const UniChar *text2Ptr, UniCharCount text2Length, Boolean *equivalent, SInt32 *order);
```

## Parameters

- `collatorRef`: A valid reference to a collator object; `NULL` is not allowed. You can use the function [UCCreateCollator](1390403-uccreatecollator.md) to obtain a collator reference.
- `text1Ptr`: A pointer to the first Unicode string (a `UniChar` array) to compare.
- `text1Length`: The total count of Unicode characters in the first string being compared.
- `text2Ptr`: A pointer to the second Unicode string to compare.
- `text2Length`: The total count of Unicode characters in the second string being compared.
- `equivalent`: A pointer to a `Boolean` value or `NULL`. On return, `UCCompareText` produces a value of `true` if the strings are equivalent for the options you have specified in the collator object. If you wish simply to sort a list of strings in order, using your specified options, you can pass `NULL` for the `equivalent` parameter and only use the `order` parameter’s result. In this case, all available comparison criteria are used to put the strings in a deterministic order, even if they are considered “equivalent” for the options you have specified. Note that you can set either the `equivalent` or the `order` parameters to `NULL`, but not both.
- `order`: A pointer to a signed, 32-bit integer value, or pass `NULL`. If you wish simply to test strings for equivalence, using your specified options (which can be much faster than determining ordering), you can pass `NULL` for the `order` parameter and only use the `equivalent` parameter’s result. (Note that either the `equivalent` or the `order` parameters may be `NULL`, but not both.
