## Discussion

If the corresponding bit is set, then the number-handling behavior is specified by the remaining number-handling option bits, instead of by the collation information for the locale. If the bit is clear, the locale controls how numbers are handled and the remaining number-handling option bits are ignored. This option is available with Mac OS 9 and later.
