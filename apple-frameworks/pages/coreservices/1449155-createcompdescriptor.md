# CreateCompDescriptor(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Services  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** macOS 10.0+

Creates a comparison descriptor that specifies how to compare one or more Apple event objects with either another Apple event object or a descriptor.

## Declaration

```swift
func CreateCompDescriptor(_ comparisonOperator: DescType, _ operand1: UnsafeMutablePointer<AEDesc>!, _ operand2: UnsafeMutablePointer<AEDesc>!, _ disposeInputs: Bool, _ theDescriptor: UnsafeMutablePointer<AEDesc>!) -> OSErr
```

## Parameters

- `comparisonOperator`: The comparison operator for comparing the descriptors in the `operand1` and `operand2` parameters. The standard comparison operators are defined in [Comparison Operator Constants](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applicationservices/apple_event_manager/comparison_operator_constants).

  The actual comparison of the two operands is performed by the object comparison function provided by the client application. The way a comparison operator is interpreted is up to each application.

  See [DescType](desctype.md).
- `operand1`: A pointer to an object specifier. See [AEDesc](aedesc.md).
- `operand2`: A pointer to a descriptor (which can be an object specifier or any other descriptor) whose value is compared to the value of `operand1`. See [AEDesc](aedesc.md).
- `disposeInputs`: A Boolean value. Pass `TRUE` if the function should automatically dispose of any descriptors you have provided in the `operand1` and `operand2` parameters to the function. Pass `FALSE` if your application will dispose of the descriptors itself. A value of `FALSE` may be more efficient for some applications because it allows them to reuse descriptors.
- `theDescriptor`: A pointer to a descriptor. On successful return, the comparison descriptor created by `CreateCompDescriptor`. Your application must dispose of this descriptor after it has finished using it. See [AEDesc](aedesc.md).
