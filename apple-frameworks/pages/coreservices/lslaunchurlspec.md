# LSLaunchURLSpec (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Services  
**Kind:** Structure  
**Availability:** macOS 10.0+

The specification for launching an app, opening items, or both, along with related information.

## Declaration

```swift
struct LSLaunchURLSpec
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

This data type defines a URL-based launch specification designating, by URL, an app to launch, items to open, or both. To request that items be opened in a particular app, set `appURL` and `itemURLs` accordingly. To request that each designated item be opened in its own preferred app, set `appURL` to `NULL`.If the item URL’s scheme is `file` (designating either a file or a directory), the selection of the preferred app is based on the designated item’s filename extension, file type, and creator signature; otherwise, it is based on the URL scheme (such as `http`, `ftp`, or `mailto`). To request that a particular app be launched without opening any document, set `appURL` accordingly and set `itemURLs` to `NULL`.

## Topics

### Creating a Launch URL

- [init()](lslaunchurlspec/1444528-init.md): Create a launch URL.
- [init(appURL:itemURLs:passThruParams:launchFlags:asyncRefCon:)](lslaunchurlspec/1446360-init.md): Create a launch URL with the provided parameters.

### Configuring a Launch URL

- [appURL](lslaunchurlspec/1443566-appurl.md): A Core Foundation URL reference designating the application to launch; see the *CFURL Reference* in the Core Foundation Reference Documentation for a description of the `CFURLRef` data type.The URL must have scheme `file` and contain a valid path to an application file or application bundle. Set this field to `NULL` to request that each item in the `itemURLs` array be opened in its own preferred application.
- [asyncRefCon](lslaunchurlspec/1448168-asyncrefcon.md): A pointer to an arbitrary application-defined value, passed in the Carbon event notifying you of an application’s launch or termination (if you have registered for such notification). The value of this field can be `NULL`.
- [itemURLs](lslaunchurlspec/1443759-itemurls.md): A reference to an array of Core Foundation URL references designating the item or items to open; see the *CFArray Reference* in the Core Foundation Reference Documentation for a description of the `CFArrayRef` data type. The value of this field can be `NULL`, in which case the application designated by `appURL` will be launched without opening any items.
- [launchFlags](lslaunchurlspec/1443957-launchflags.md): Launch flags specifying how to launch each application (including whether to print or merely open documents); see [LSLaunchFlags](lslaunchflags.md) for a description of these flags.
- [passThruParams](lslaunchurlspec/1445136-passthruparams.md): A pointer to an Apple event descriptor that is passed untouched as an optional parameter, with keyword `keyAEPropData` (`'prdt'`), in the Apple event sent to each application launched or activated (whether individual preferred applications or the application designated by `appURL`). See the *Apple Event Manager Reference* in the Carbon Interapplication Communication Documentation for a description of the `AEDesc` data type. The value of this field can be `NULL`.

### Opening Items

- [LSOpenCFURLRef(\_:\_:)](1442850-lsopencfurlref.md): Opens an item for a URL in the default manner in its preferred app.
- [LSOpenFromURLSpec(\_:\_:)](1441986-lsopenfromurlspec.md): Opens one or more items for a URL in the preferred apps or a designated app.
- [LSSharedFileList](lssharedfilelist.md): A persistent list of file-system objects.
- [LSSharedFileListItem](lssharedfilelistitem.md): A file-system object in the shared file list.
