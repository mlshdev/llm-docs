# AEProcessMessage(\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Services  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** macOS 10.0+

Decodes and dispatches a low level Mach message event to an event handler, including packaging and returning the reply to the sender.

## Declaration

```swift
func AEProcessMessage(_ header: UnsafeMutablePointer<mach_msg_header_t>!) -> OSStatus
```

## Parameters

- `header`: A pointer to the received Mach message that should be processed. The contents of the message header are invalid after calling this method.

## Return Value

A result code. See [Result Codes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applicationservices/apple_event_manager#1656145).

## Discussion

The Apple Event Manager provides the following functions (in macOS only) for working with Apple events at a lower level: [AEGetRegisteredMachPort()](1449736-aegetregisteredmachport.md), [AEDecodeMessage(\_:\_:\_:)](1447827-aedecodemessage.md), [AESendMessage(\_:\_:\_:\_:)](1442994-aesendmessage.md), and `AEProcessMessage`. See the descriptions for those functions for more information on when you might use them.

If your daemon or other code has initialized a Mach port and is listening on it for Apple events and other messages, it can call `AEProcessMessage` to handle any incoming events it identifies as Apple events, while handling other types of events itself. `AEProcessMessage` will dispatch the event to an event handler (by calling `AEDecodeMessage` for you) and package and return the reply to the sender, simplifying handling for your code.

The Apple Event Manager reserves Mach message IDs in the range 0 to 999 for its own use. `AEProcessMessage` returns a `paramErr` result code if the Mach message did not contain an Apple event.

### Working With Lower Level Apple Event Functions

- [AEGetRegisteredMachPort()](1449736-aegetregisteredmachport.md): Returns the Mach port (in the form of a `mach_port_t`) that was registered with the bootstrap server for this process.
- [AEDecodeMessage(\_:\_:\_:)](1447827-aedecodemessage.md): Decodes a Mach message and converts it into an Apple event and its related reply.
- [AESendMessage(\_:\_:\_:\_:)](1442994-aesendmessage.md): Sends an AppleEvent to a target process without some of the overhead required by `AESend`.
