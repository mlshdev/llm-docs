# attributionToken() (Swift)

**Framework:** AdServices  
**Kind:** Type Method  
**Availability:** iOS 14.3+ · iPadOS 14.3+ · Mac Catalyst 14.3+ · macOS 11.1+ · visionOS 1.0+

Generates a token.

```swift
class func attributionToken() throws -> String
```

<a id="discussion"></a>

## Discussion

The token that the framework returns is a Base64 encoded string and has a 24-hour TTL. You can provide the token to a Mobile Measurement Provider (MMP), or app developers can use it to make a `POST` API call to fetch attribution records within the 24-hour TTL window. Use a single token in the request body and use a content-type of `text/plain` in the header, as the following example shows:

```other
POST https://api-adservices.apple.com/api/v1/
--header 'Content-Type: text/plain' \
--data-raw

```

> **Important**

> A 404 response can occur if you make an API call too quickly after receiving a valid token. A best practice is to initiate retries at intervals of 5 seconds, with a maximum of three attempts.

## Response codes

| **Response** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| 200 | Success. If the API finds a matching attribution record, the payload returns `attribution=true`. ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.AdServices/spacer.png)If the API cannot find a matching attribution record, or if the ad group uses age or gender settings, the payload returns `attribution=false`. In this case, the `200` `OK` response is acknowledgment of the receipt of the data request. |
| 400 | The token is invalid. |
| 404 | Not found. The API is unable to retrieve the requested attribution record.  ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.AdServices/spacer.png)Tokens have a TTL of 24 hours. If the `POST` API call exceeds 24 hours, a `404` response returns. If your token is valid, a best practice is to initiate retries at intervals of 5 seconds with a maximum of three attempts. |
| 500 | The Apple Ads server is temporarily down or unreachable. The request may be valid, but you need to retry it later. |

<a id="Attribution-payloads"></a>

## Attribution payloads

The attribution record is a data dictionary with key-value pairs that correspond to your Apple Ads campaigns and app downloads from devices running iOS 14 and later. Run reports to review detailed campaign metadata in the [Apple Ads Platform API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple-ads-platform-api) or [Apple Ads Advanced](https://ads.apple.com/advanced/).
