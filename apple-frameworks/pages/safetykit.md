## Overview

SafetyKit provides Crash Detection, a feature that sends a crash event to an authorized app if a person is in a severe vehicular crash as detected by their iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro, Apple Watch Series 8, Apple Watch SE (2nd generation), or Apple Watch Ultra. These devices provide a feature called Emergency SOS - Call After Severe Crash. If enabled, Emergency SOS dials a municipal emergency service such as 911 in the event of a vehicular crash. After Emergency SOS places its call, Crash Detection can assist someone by initiating a call to a contact designated by the app, such as a roadside assistance provider.

SafetyKit supports three crash scenarios. In each scenario, Apple is the first party, and your app is the third party.

The first scenario has first-party Emergency SOS turned off and third-party sharing turned on. When the device detects a crash, a critical alert occurs and the third party receives the crash information.

In the second scenario, first-party Emergency SOS and third-party sharing are turned on. When the device detects a crash, the first-party Emergency SOS runs automatically. After the first party completes its procedures, a critical alert occurs and the third party receives the crash information.

In the third scenario, first-party Emergency SOS is turned on and there’s no third-party sharing. When the device detects a crash, the first-party Emergency SOS runs automatically.

> **Important**

>  Crash Detection requires the [com.apple.developer.severe-vehicular-crash-event](bundleresources/entitlements/com.apple.developer.severe-vehicular-crash-event.md) entitlement. To apply for this entitlement, see [Request Access to the Vehicular Crash Event Entitlement](https://developer.apple.com/contact/request/vehicular-crash-events/).

To support Crash Detection, use [SACrashDetectionManager](safetykit/sacrashdetectionmanager.md) to determine whether it’s available and if so, ask permission to allow your app to receive crash events. Then set [delegate](safetykit/sacrashdetectionmanager/delegate.md) to the object that receives the events. Only one app on the device can receive Crash Detection events.

If your app receives a Crash Detection event, use [SAEmergencyResponseManager](safetykit/saemergencyresponsemanager.md) to provide assistance.

## Topics

### Detecting a crash

- [SACrashDetectionManager](safetykit/sacrashdetectionmanager.md): Provides registration and management of Crash Detection events.
