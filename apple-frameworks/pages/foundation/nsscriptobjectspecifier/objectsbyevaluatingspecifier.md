# objectsByEvaluatingSpecifier (Swift)

**Framework:** Foundation  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.0+

Returns the actual object represented by the nested series of object specifiers.

## Declaration

```swift
var objectsByEvaluatingSpecifier: Any? { get }
```

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

The actual object represented by the nested series of object specifiers.

## Discussion

Recursively obtains the next container in a nested series of object specifiers until it reaches the top-level container specifier (which is either an [NSWhoseSpecifier](../nswhosespecifier.md) or the application object), after which it begins evaluating each object specifier ([objectsByEvaluating(withContainers:)](objectsbyevaluating%28withcontainers_%29.md)) going in the opposite direction (top-level to innermost) as it unwinds from the stack. Returns the actual object represented by the nested series of object specifiers. Returns `nil` if a container specifier could not be evaluated or if no top-level container specifier could be found. Thus `nil` can be a valid value or can indicate an error; you can use [evaluationErrorNumber](evaluationerrornumber.md) to determine if and which error occurred and [evaluationError](evaluationerror.md) to find the container specifier responsible for the error. In the normal course of command processing, this method is invoked by an `NSScriptCommand` object’s [evaluatedArguments](../nsscriptcommand/evaluatedarguments.md) and [evaluatedReceivers](../nsscriptcommand/evaluatedreceivers.md) methods, which take as message receiver the innermost object specifier.
