If the receiver hasn’t already done so, retains the target and all object arguments of the receiver and copies all of its C-string arguments and blocks. If a returnvalue has been set, this is also retained or copied.

## Declaration

```objectivec
- (void) retainArguments;
```

## Discussion

Before this method is invoked, [argumentsRetained](argumentsretained.md) returns [false](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false); after, it returns [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true).

For efficiency, newly created `NSInvocation` objects don’t retain or copy their arguments, nor do they retain their targets, copy C strings, or copy any associated blocks. You should instruct an `NSInvocation` object to retain its arguments if you intend to cache it, because the arguments may otherwise be released before the invocation is invoked. `NSTimer` objects always instruct their invocations to retain their arguments, for example, because there’s usually a delay before a timer fires.

- [selector](selector.md): The receiver’s selector, or 0 if it hasn’t been set.
- [target](target.md): The receiver’s target, or `nil` if the receiver has no target.
- [setArgument:atIndex:](setargument_atindex_.md): Sets an argument of the receiver.
- [getArgument:atIndex:](getargument_atindex_.md): Returns by indirection the receiver’s argument at a specified index.
- [argumentsRetained](argumentsretained.md): A Boolean value that indicates if the receiver has retained its arguments.
- [setReturnValue:](setreturnvalue_.md): Sets the receiver’s return value.
- [getReturnValue:](getreturnvalue_.md): Gets the invocation’s return value.
