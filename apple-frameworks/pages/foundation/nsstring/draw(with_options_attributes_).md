# draw(with:options:attributes:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Foundation  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** macOS 10.0+ (deprecated in 27.0)

Draws the receiver with the specified options and other display characteristics of the given attributes, within the specified rectangle in the current graphics context.

## Declaration

```swift
func draw(with rect: NSRect, options: NSString.DrawingOptions = [], attributes: [NSAttributedString.Key : Any]? = nil)
```

## Parameters

- `rect`: The rectangle in which to draw the string.
- `options`: String drawing options.
- `attributes`: A dictionary of text attributes to be applied to the string. These are the same attributes that can be applied to an `NSAttributedString` object, but in the case of `NSString` objects, the attributes apply to the entire string, rather than ranges within the string.

## Discussion

This method works in single-line, baseline rendering configuration by default. That is, the `rect` argument’s `origin` field specifies the rendering origin, and that point is interpreted as the baseline origin by default. If the string drawing option `NSStringDrawingUsesLineFragmentOrigin` is specified, `origin` is interpreted as the upper left corner of the line fragment rectangle, and the method behaves in multiline configuration.

The `size` field specifies the text container size. The `width` part of the size field specifies the maximum line fragment width if larger than `0.0`. The `height` defines the maximum size that can be occupied with text if larger than `0.0` and `NSStringDrawingUsesLineFragmentOrigin` is specified. If `NSStringDrawingUsesLineFragmentOrigin` is not specified, height is ignored and considered to be single-line rendering (`NSLineBreakByWordWrapping` and `NSLineBreakByCharWrapping` are treated as `NSLineBreakByClipping`).

You should only invoke this method when there is a current graphics context.

# drawWithRect:options:attributes: (Objective-C)

**Framework:** Foundation  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** macOS 10.0+ (deprecated in 27.0)

Draws the receiver with the specified options and other display characteristics of the given attributes, within the specified rectangle in the current graphics context.

## Declaration

```objectivec
- (void) drawWithRect:(NSRect) rect options:(NSStringDrawingOptions) options attributes:(NSDictionary<NSString *,id> *) attributes;
```

## Parameters

- `rect`: The rectangle in which to draw the string.
