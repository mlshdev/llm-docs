# init(characters:length:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Foundation  
**Kind:** Initializer  
**Availability:** iOS 2.0+ · iPadOS 2.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.0+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

Returns an initialized `NSString` object that contains a given number of characters from a given C array of UTF-16 code units.

## Declaration

```swift
convenience init(characters: UnsafePointer<unichar>, length: Int)
```

## Parameters

- `characters`: A C array of UTF-16 code units; the value must not be `NULL`.

  > **Important**

  >  Raises an exception if `characters` is `NULL`, even if `length` is `0`.
- `length`: The number of characters to use from `characters`.

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

An initialized `NSString` object containing `length` characters taken from `characters`. The returned object may be different from the original receiver.

### Creating and Initializing Strings

- [init()](init%28%29.md): Returns an initialized `NSString` object that contains no characters.
- [init(bytes:length:encoding:)](init%28bytes_length_encoding_%29.md): Returns an initialized `NSString` object containing a given number of bytes from a given buffer of bytes interpreted in a given encoding.
- [init(bytesNoCopy:length:encoding:freeWhenDone:)](init%28bytesnocopy_length_encoding_freewhendone_%29.md): Returns an initialized `NSString` object that contains a given number of bytes from a given buffer of bytes interpreted in a given encoding, and optionally frees the buffer.
- [init(charactersNoCopy:length:freeWhenDone:)](init%28charactersnocopy_length_freewhendone_%29.md): Returns an initialized `NSString` object that contains a given number of characters from a given C array of UTF-16 code units.
- [init(string:)](init%28string_%29-210xa.md): Returns an `NSString` object initialized by copying the characters from another given string.
- [init(format:arguments:)](init%28format_arguments_%29.md): Returns an `NSString` object initialized by using a given format string as a template into which the remaining argument values are substituted without any localization.
- [init(format:locale:arguments:)](init%28format_locale_arguments_%29.md): Returns an `NSString` object initialized by using a given format string as a template into which the remaining argument values are substituted according to given locale information. This method is meant to be called from within a variadic function, where the argument list will be available.
- [init(data:encoding:)](init%28data_encoding_%29.md): Returns an `NSString` object initialized by converting given data into UTF-16 code units using a given encoding.
- [localizedUserNotificationString(forKey:arguments:)](localizedusernotificationstring%28forkey_arguments_%29.md): Returns a localized string intended for display in a notification alert.
- [localizedStringWithFormat(\_:\_:)](localizedstringwithformat%28____%29.md)
- [unichar](../unichar.md): Type for UTF-16 code units.
