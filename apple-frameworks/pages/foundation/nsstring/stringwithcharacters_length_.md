Returns a string containing a given number of characters taken from a given C array of UTF-16 code units.

## Declaration

```objectivec
+ (instancetype) stringWithCharacters:(const unichar *) characters length:(NSUInteger) length;
```

## Parameters

- `characters`: A C array of UTF-16 code units; the value must not be `NULL`.

### Creating and Initializing Strings

- [string](string.md): Returns an empty string.
- [init](init%28%29.md): Returns an initialized `NSString` object that contains no characters.
- [initWithBytes:length:encoding:](init%28bytes_length_encoding_%29.md): Returns an initialized `NSString` object containing a given number of bytes from a given buffer of bytes interpreted in a given encoding.
- [initWithBytesNoCopy:length:encoding:freeWhenDone:](init%28bytesnocopy_length_encoding_freewhendone_%29.md): Returns an initialized `NSString` object that contains a given number of bytes from a given buffer of bytes interpreted in a given encoding, and optionally frees the buffer.
- [initWithCharacters:length:](init%28characters_length_%29.md): Returns an initialized `NSString` object that contains a given number of characters from a given C array of UTF-16 code units.
- [initWithCharactersNoCopy:length:freeWhenDone:](init%28charactersnocopy_length_freewhendone_%29.md): Returns an initialized `NSString` object that contains a given number of characters from a given C array of UTF-16 code units.
- [initWithString:](init%28string_%29-210xa.md): Returns an `NSString` object initialized by copying the characters from another given string.
- [initWithFormat:](initwithformat_.md): Returns an `NSString` object initialized by using a given format string as a template into which the remaining argument values are substituted.
- [initWithFormat:arguments:](init%28format_arguments_%29.md): Returns an `NSString` object initialized by using a given format string as a template into which the remaining argument values are substituted without any localization.
- [initWithFormat:locale:](initwithformat_locale_.md): Returns an `NSString` object initialized by using a given format string as a template into which the remaining argument values are substituted according to given locale.
- [initWithFormat:locale:arguments:](init%28format_locale_arguments_%29.md): Returns an `NSString` object initialized by using a given format string as a template into which the remaining argument values are substituted according to given locale information. This method is meant to be called from within a variadic function, where the argument list will be available.
- [initWithData:encoding:](init%28data_encoding_%29.md): Returns an `NSString` object initialized by converting given data into UTF-16 code units using a given encoding.
- [stringWithFormat:](stringwithformat_.md): Returns a string created by using a given format string as a template into which the remaining argument values are substituted.
- [localizedStringWithFormat:](localizedstringwithformat_.md): Returns a string created by using a given format string as a template into which the remaining argument values are substituted according to the current locale.
- [localizedUserNotificationStringForKey:arguments:](localizedusernotificationstring%28forkey_arguments_%29.md): Returns a localized string intended for display in a notification alert.
