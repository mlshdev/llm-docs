# encodeValue(ofObjCType:at:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Foundation  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 2.0+ · iPadOS 2.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.0+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

Encodes a value of the given type at the given address.

## Declaration

```swift
func encodeValue(ofObjCType type: UnsafePointer<CChar>, at addr: UnsafeRawPointer)
```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

Subclasses must override this method, and match it with a subsequent [decodeValue(ofObjCType:at:)](decodevalue%28ofobjctype_at_%29.md) message.

When calling this method, `valueType` must contain exactly one type code.

For information on creating an Objective-C type code suitable for `valueType`, see [Type Encodings](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjCRuntimeGuide/Articles/ocrtTypeEncodings.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008048-CH100).

### Special Considerations

You should not use this method to encode Objective-C objects. See [decodeArray(ofObjCType:count:at:)](decodearray%28ofobjctype_count_at_%29.md) for more details.
