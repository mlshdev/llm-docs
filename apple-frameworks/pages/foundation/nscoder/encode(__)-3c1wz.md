# encode(\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Foundation  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.0+

Encodes a rectangle structure.

## Declaration

```swift
func encode(_ rect: NSRect)
```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

`NSCoder`’s implementation invokes [encodeValue(ofObjCType:at:)](encodevalue%28ofobjctype_at_%29.md) to encode `rect`.

This method must be matched by a subsequent [decodeRect()](decoderect%28%29.md) message.

### Encoding General Data

- [encodeArray(ofObjCType:count:at:)](encodearray%28ofobjctype_count_at_%29.md): Encodes an array of the given Objective-C type, provided the number of items and a pointer.
- [encode(\_:forKey:)](encode%28__forkey_%29-7o6mu.md): Encodes a Boolean value and associates it with the string `key`.
- [encodeBycopyObject(\_:)](encodebycopyobject%28__%29.md): An encoding method for subclasses to override such that it creates a copy, rather than a proxy, when decoded.
- [encodeByrefObject(\_:)](encodebyrefobject%28__%29.md): An encoding method for subclasses to override such that it creates a proxy, rather than a copy, when decoded.
- [encodeBytes(\_:length:)](encodebytes%28__length_%29.md): Encodes a buffer of data of an unspecified type.
- [encodeBytes(\_:length:forKey:)](encodebytes%28__length_forkey_%29.md): Encodes a buffer of data, given its length and a pointer, and associates it with a string key.

- [encodeConditionalObject(\_:forKey:)](encodeconditionalobject%28__forkey_%29.md): An encoding method for subclasses to override to conditionally encode an object, preserving common references to it, only if it has been unconditionally encoded.
- [encode(\_:)](encode%28__%29-1qd1e.md): Encodes a given data object.
- [encode(\_:forKey:)](encode%28__forkey_%29-9xiiu.md): Encodes a double-precision floating point value and associates it with the string key.
- [encode(\_:forKey:)](encode%28__forkey_%29-84cez.md): Encodes a floating point value and associates it with the string key.
- [encodeCInt(\_:forKey:)](encodecint%28__forkey_%29.md): Encodes a C integer value and associates it with the string key.
- [encode(\_:forKey:)](encode%28__forkey_%29-2dprz.md): Encodes an integer value and associates it with the string key.
- [encode(\_:forKey:)](encode%28__forkey_%29-5sk4z.md): Encodes a 32-bit integer value and associates it with the string key.
- [encode(\_:forKey:)](encode%28__forkey_%29-dixg.md): Encodes a 64-bit integer value and associates it with the string key.
