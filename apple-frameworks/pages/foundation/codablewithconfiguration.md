# CodableWithConfiguration

**Framework:** Foundation  
**Kind:** Type Alias  
**Availability:** iOS 15.0+ · iPadOS 15.0+ · Mac Catalyst 15.0+ · macOS 12.0+ · tvOS 15.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 8.0+

A type that can convert itself into and out of an external representation with the help of a configuration that handles encoding contained types.

## Declaration

```swift
typealias CodableWithConfiguration = DecodableWithConfiguration & EncodableWithConfiguration
```

## Discussion

[CodableWithConfiguration](codablewithconfiguration.md) is a type alias for the [EncodableWithConfiguration](encodablewithconfiguration.md) and [DecodableWithConfiguration](decodablewithconfiguration.md) protocols. Use this protocol to support codability in a type that can’t conform to [Codable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/codable) by itself, but can do so with additional statically-defined configuration provided by a [CodableConfiguration](codableconfiguration.md) instance.

[AttributedString](attributedstring.md) uses this approach to allow an instance to contain arbitrary attributes, including frameworks outside of Foundation or the platform SDK. It does this by including one or more [AttributeScope](attributescope.md) instances, a type that conforms to [EncodingConfigurationProviding](encodingconfigurationproviding.md) and [DecodingConfigurationProviding](decodingconfigurationproviding.md). An attribute scope like [AttributeScopes.SwiftUIAttributes](attributescopes/swiftuiattributes.md) defines attribute keys, and conforms to [AttributeScope](attributescope.md) to provide configuration instances that know the [AttributedStringKey](attributedstringkey.md) types and their associated [Value](attributedstringkey/value.md) types. With this type information, an [AttributedString](attributedstring.md) can encode all of its attributes, even from frameworks other than Foundation.
