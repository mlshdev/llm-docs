# current

**Framework:** Foundation  
**Kind:** Type Property  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ · iPadOS 8.0+ · Mac Catalyst 8.0+ · macOS 10.10+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

A locale representing the user’s region settings at the time the property is read.

## Declaration

```swift
static var current: Locale { get }
```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

This value represents the locale currently used by the app, based on the following:

- The current system locale.
- Any app-specific locale choice made in the Settings app.
- The availability of the preferred locale in the app. For example, if the person using an app has set their device to use a Spanish-language locale, but the app only supports English, this value returns an English locale.

Use this property when you need to rely on a consistent locale. A locale instance obtained this way does not change even when the person using the device changes language or region settings. If you want a locale instance that always reflects the current configuration, use the one provided by the [autoupdatingCurrent](autoupdatingcurrent.md) property instead.

To receive notification of locale changes in Swift, add an observer for [Locale.CurrentLocaleDidChangeMessage](currentlocaledidchangemessage.md). In Objective-C, you can add your object as an observer of [currentLocaleDidChangeNotification](../nslocale/currentlocaledidchangenotification.md).
