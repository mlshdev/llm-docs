## Discussion

When called on the special [Locale](../locale.md) instances [current](current.md) or [autoupdatingCurrent](autoupdatingcurrent.md), if the user overrode the default hour cycle, this property provides the user’s preference.

This property corresponds to the `hc` key of the Unicode BCP 47 extension.

For locale instances created with the `hc` specifier (such as `en-US@hc=h23`), or with a custom [Locale.Components](components.md), this property represents the custom hour cycle. Otherwise, it represents the locale’s default hour cycle.
