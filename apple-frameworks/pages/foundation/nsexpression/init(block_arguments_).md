# init(block:arguments:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Foundation  
**Kind:** Initializer  
**Availability:** iOS 4.0+ · iPadOS 4.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.6+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

Creates an expression object that uses the block for evaluating objects.

## Declaration

```swift
init(block: @escaping (Any?, [NSExpression], NSMutableDictionary?) -> Any, arguments: [NSExpression]?)
```

## Parameters

- `block`: The Block is applied to the object to be evaluated.

  The Block takes three arguments and returns a value:

  - **evaluatedObject**: The object to be evaluated.
  - **expressions**: An array of predicate expressions that evaluates to a collection.
  - **context**: A dictionary that the expression can use to store temporary state for one predicate evaluation.

  Note that `context` is mutable, and that it can only be accessed during the evaluation of the expression. You must not attempt to retain it for use elsewhere. \]

  The Block returns the `evaluatedObject`.
- `arguments`: An array containing `NSExpression` objects that will be used as parameters during the invocation of selector.

  For a selector taking no parameters, the array should be empty. For a selector taking one or more parameters, the array should contain one `NSExpression` object which will evaluate to an instance of the appropriate type for each parameter.

  If there is a mismatch between the number of parameters expected and the number you provide during evaluation, an exception may be raised or missing parameters may simply be replaced by `nil` (which occurs depends on how many parameters are provided, and whether you have over- or underflow).

  See [init(forFunction:arguments:)](init%28forfunction_arguments_%29.md) for a complete list of arguments.

## Return Value

An expression that filters a collection using the specified Block.

Creates an expression object that uses the block for evaluating objects.

## Declaration

```objectivec

  The Block takes three arguments and returns a value:

  - **evaluatedObject**: The object to be evaluated.
  - **expressions**: An array of predicate expressions that evaluates to a collection.
