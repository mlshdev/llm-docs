# timeoutInterval

**Framework:** Foundation

## Discussion

If during a connection attempt the request remains idle for longer than the timeout interval, the request is considered to have timed out. The default timeout interval is 60 seconds.

As a general rule, you should not use short timeout intervals. Instead, you should provide an easy way for the user to cancel a long-running operation.

### Controlling request behavior

- [httpShouldHandleCookies](httpshouldhandlecookies.md): A Boolean value indicating whether cookies will be sent with and set for this request.
- [httpShouldUsePipelining](httpshouldusepipelining.md): Deprecated. A Boolean value indicating whether the request should transmit before the previous response is received.
- [allowsCellularAccess](allowscellularaccess.md): A Boolean value indicating whether the request is allowed to use the built-in cellular radios to satisfy the request.
- [allowsPersistentDNS](allowspersistentdns.md): `true` if the request is allowed to store and use DNS answers, potentially beyond TTL expiry, in a persistent per-process cache, `false` otherwise. Defaults to `false`. This should only be set to `true` for hostnames whose resolutions are not expected to change across networks.
- [assumesHTTP3Capable](assumeshttp3capable.md): `true` if server endpoint is known to support HTTP/3. Enables QUIC racing without HTTP/3 service discovery. Defaults to `false`. The default may be `true` in a future OS update.
- [cookiePartitionIdentifier](cookiepartitionidentifier.md)
- [requiresDNSSECValidation](requiresdnssecvalidation.md): `true` if the request is required to do DNSSEC validation during DNS lookup. `false` otherwise. Defaults to `false`.
