# priority (Swift)

**Framework:** Foundation  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ · iPadOS 8.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.10+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

The relative priority at which you’d like a host to handle the task, specified as a floating point value between `0.0` (lowest priority) and `1.0` (highest priority).

## Declaration

```swift
var priority: Float { get set }
```

## Discussion

To provide hints to a host on how to prioritize URL session tasks from your app, specify a priority for each task. Specifying a priority provides only a hint and does not guarantee performance. If you don’t specify a priority, a URL session task has a priority of [defaultPriority](defaultpriority.md), with a value of `0.5`.

There are three named priorities you can employ, described in [URL session task priority](../url-session-task-priority.md).

You can specify or change a task’s priority at any time, but not all networking protocols respond to changes after a task has started. There is no API to let you determine the effective priority for a task from a host’s perspective.

### Controlling the task state

- [cancel()](cancel%28%29.md): Cancels the task.
- [resume()](resume%28%29.md): Resumes the task, if it is suspended.
- [suspend()](suspend%28%29.md): Temporarily suspends a task.
- [state](state-swift.property.md): The current state of the task—active, suspended, in the process of being canceled, or completed.
- [URLSessionTask.State](state-swift.enum.md): Constants for determining the current state of a task.
- [URL session task priority](../url-session-task-priority.md): Constants for providing task priority hints to a host, used with the [priority](priority.md) property.
