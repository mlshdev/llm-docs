Newly-initialized tasks begin in a suspended state, so you need to call this method to start the task.

### Controlling the task state

- [cancel()](cancel%28%29.md): Cancels the task.
- [suspend()](suspend%28%29.md): Temporarily suspends a task.
- [state](state-swift.property.md): The current state of the task—active, suspended, in the process of being canceled, or completed.
- [URLSessionTask.State](state-swift.enum.md): Constants for determining the current state of a task.
- [priority](priority.md): The relative priority at which you’d like a host to handle the task, specified as a floating point value between `0.0` (lowest priority) and `1.0` (highest priority).
- [URL session task priority](../url-session-task-priority.md): Constants for providing task priority hints to a host, used with the [priority](priority.md) property.
