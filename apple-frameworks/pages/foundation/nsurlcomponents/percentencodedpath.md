# percentEncodedPath (Swift)

**Framework:** Foundation  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 7.0+ · iPadOS 7.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.9+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

The path URL component expressed as a URL-encoded string, or `nil` if not present.

## Declaration

```swift
var percentEncodedPath: String? { get set }
```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

For example, in the URL `http://www.example.com/index.html`, the path is `/index.html`.

If you set this value to something that is not a valid, percent-encoded string, this class throws an exception.

> **Note**

>  Although an unencoded semicolon is a valid character in a percent-encoded path, for compatibility with the [NSURL](../nsurl.md) class, you should always percent-encode it. To properly encode a string for use in the path component of a URL, use the character set returned by the `URLPathAllowedCharacterSet` method in conjunction with the [addingPercentEncoding(withAllowedCharacters:)](../nsstring/addingpercentencoding%28withallowedcharacters_%29.md) method.
