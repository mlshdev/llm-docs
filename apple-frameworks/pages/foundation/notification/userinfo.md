Storage for values or objects related to this notification.

## Declaration

```swift
var userInfo: [AnyHashable : Any]?
```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

The user information dictionary stores any additional objects that objects receiving the notification might use.

For example, in AppKit, [NSControl](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nscontrol) objects post the [textDidChangeNotification](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nscontrol/textdidchangenotification) whenever the field editor (an [NSText](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstext) object) changes text inside the `NSControl`. This notification provides the `NSControl` object as the notification’s associated object. In order to provide access to the field editor, the `NSControl` object posting the notification adds the field editor to the notification’s user information dictionary. Objects receiving the notification can access the field editor and the `NSControl` object posting the notification as follows:

```swift
func controlTextDidChange(_ notification: Notification) 
{
    if let fieldEditor = notification.userInfo?["NSFieldEditor"] as? NSText,
        let postingObject = notification.object as? NSControl
    {
        // work with the field editor and posting object
    }
}
```
