# delegate (Swift)

**Framework:** Foundation  
**Kind:** Instance Property

```

## Discussion

It is recommended that you assign a delegate to the file manager object only if you allocated and initialized the object yourself. Avoid assigning a delegate to the shared file manager obtained from the [default](default.md) method.

The default value of this property is `nil`. When assigning a delegate to this property, your object must conform to the [FileManagerDelegate](../filemanagerdelegate.md) protocol.
