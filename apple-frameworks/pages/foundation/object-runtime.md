# Object Runtime (Swift)

**Framework:** Foundation  
**Kind:** API Collection

Get low-level support for basic Objective-C features, Cocoa design patterns, and Swift integration.

## Topics

### Object Basics

- [NSObject](../objectivec/nsobject-swift.class.md): The root class of most Objective-C class hierarchies, from which subclasses inherit a basic interface to the runtime system and the ability to behave as Objective-C objects.
- [NSObjectProtocol](../objectivec/nsobjectprotocol.md): The group of methods that are fundamental to all Objective-C objects.
- [NSKeyValueCoding](../objectivec/nskeyvaluecoding.md): A mechanism by which you can access the properties of an object indirectly by name or key.

### Copying

- [NSCopying](nscopying.md): A protocol that objects adopt to provide functional copies of themselves.
- [NSMutableCopying](nsmutablecopying.md): A protocol that mutable objects adopt to provide functional copies of themselves.

### Value Wrappers and Transformations

- [NSNumber](nsnumber.md): An object wrapper for primitive scalar numeric values.
- [NSValue](nsvalue.md): A simple container for a single C or Objective-C data item.
- [ValueTransformer](valuetransformer.md): An abstract class used to transform values from one representation to another.

### Swift Support

SupportedLanguage(swift)

- [ReferenceConvertible](referenceconvertible.md): A decoration applied to types that are backed by a Foundation reference type.
- [Classes Bridged to Swift Standard Library Value Types](classes-bridged-to-swift-standard-library-value-types.md): Use bridged reference types when you need reference semantics or Foundation-specific behavior.

### Remote Objects

- [NSProxy](nsproxy.md): An abstract superclass defining an API for objects that act as stand-ins for other objects or for objects that don’t exist yet.

### Memory Management

- [Memory Management Functions](memory-management-functions.md): Perform low-level memory management tasks.

### Objective-C Runtime

- [Objective-C Runtime Utilities](objective-c-runtime-utilities.md): Interact with the Objective-C runtime.

### Versions and API Availability

- [Foundation Framework Version Numbers](foundation-framework-version-numbers.md): Recognize the constants for comparing the current running version of Foundation against known OS version numbers.

### Legacy

SupportedLanguage(swift)

- [Distributed Objects Support](distributed-objects-support.md): Enable communication among objects in different processes, both locally and on remote systems.
- [Objective-C Garbage Collection](objective-c-garbage-collection.md): Interface with the legacy garbage collection system.

## See Also

### Low-Level Utilities

- [XPC](xpc.md): Manage secure interprocess communication.
- [Processes and Threads](processes-and-threads.md): Manage your app’s interaction with the host operating system and other processes, and implement low-level concurrency features.
- [Streams, Sockets, and Ports](streams-sockets-and-ports.md): Use low-level Unix features to manage input and output among files, processes, and the network.
