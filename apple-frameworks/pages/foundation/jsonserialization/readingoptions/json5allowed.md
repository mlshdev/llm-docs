# json5Allowed (Swift)

**Framework:** Foundation  
**Kind:** Type Property  
**Availability:** iOS 15.0+ · iPadOS 15.0+ · Mac Catalyst 15.0+ · macOS 12.0+ · tvOS 15.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 8.0+

Specifies that reading serialized JSON data supports the JSON5 syntax.

## Declaration

```swift
static var json5Allowed: JSONSerialization.ReadingOptions { get }
```

## Discussion

The JSON5 Data Interchange Format is a superset of JSON that enhances human-readability of the JSON syntax. The JSON5 standard allows the following:

- Single- or double-quoted strings.
- Strings that span multiple lines.
- Single- and multiline comments, using `//` and `/* … */` syntax.
- Enhanced number formatting support, including hexadecimal, leading or trailing decimal point, explicit plus sign, and IEEE 754 positive infinity, negative infinity, and `NaN`.

### Using JSON5 in Attributed Strings

The Markdown syntax supported by [AttributedString](../../attributedstring.md) uses JSON5 to support an extended attribute syntax. Automatic grammar agreement uses this syntax for its `inflect` attribute, as do custom attributes defined by third-party frameworks. Use the syntax `^[text](attribute: value)` to mark ranges of text decorated with a custom attribute, like this:

```other
This is a [Markdown](https://commonmark.org) string with a ^[custom attribute](factor: 10).
```

This example applies a custom attribute called `factor` with a value of `10` to the text “custom attribute” in the resulting attributed string. The portion inside the parentheses is JSON5. [AttributedString](../../attributedstring.md) also uses the [topLevelDictionaryAssumed](topleveldictionaryassumed.md) option; without it, the Markdown string would have to wrap everything inside the parentheses with braces.

### Reading Options

- [mutableContainers](mutablecontainers.md): Specifies that arrays and dictionaries in the returned object are mutable.
- [mutableLeaves](mutableleaves.md): Specifies that leaf strings in the JSON object graph are mutable.
- [fragmentsAllowed](fragmentsallowed.md): Specifies that the parser allows top-level objects that aren’t arrays or dictionaries.
- [topLevelDictionaryAssumed](topleveldictionaryassumed.md): Specifies that the parser assumes the top level of the JSON data is a dictionary, even if it doesn’t begin and end with curly braces.
- [allowFragments](allowfragments.md): Deprecated. A deprecated option that specifies that the parser should allow top-level objects that aren’t arrays or dictionaries.
