```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

The undo manager posts this message after you call [redo()](redo%28%29.md). Because this is a “will”-style message, the undo manager sends the message before it performs the redo.

Observe this message with the identifier [willRedoChange](../notificationcenter/messageidentifier/willredochange.md), or specify its type directly to the `addObserver(of:for:using:)` method. The [Subject](../notificationcenter/mainactormessage/subject.md) of this message type is [UndoManager](../undomanager.md).

This message interoperates with the notification [NSUndoManagerWillRedoChange](../nsnotification/name-swift.struct/nsundomanagerwillredochange.md). The system notifies observers of the message when the [NotificationCenter](../notificationcenter.md) posts the notification. Similarly, the system notifies observers of the notification when it posts the message.
