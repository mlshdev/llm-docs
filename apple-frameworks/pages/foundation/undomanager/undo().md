# undo() (Swift)

**Framework:** Foundation  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 3.0+ · iPadOS 3.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.0+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

Closes the top-level undo group if necessary, and then performs undo operations on the group.

## Declaration

```swift
func undo()
```

## Discussion

After closing the top-level undo group, this method invokes [undoNestedGroup()](undonestedgroup%28%29.md).

This method also invokes [endUndoGrouping()](endundogrouping%28%29.md) if the nesting level is 1. Raises an `NSInternalInconsistencyException` if more than one undo group is open (that is, if the last group isn’t at the top level).

This method posts an [NSUndoManagerCheckpoint](../nsnotification/name-swift.struct/nsundomanagercheckpoint.md).

### Related Documentation

- [groupingLevel](groupinglevel.md): The number of nested undo groups (or redo groups, if redo is the most recent operation) in the current event loop.
- [enableUndoRegistration()](enableundoregistration%28%29.md): Enables the recording of undo operations.

### Performing undo and redo

- [undoNestedGroup()](undonestedgroup%28%29.md): Performs the undo operations in the last undo group (whether top-level or nested), recording the operations on the redo stack as a single group.
- [redo()](redo%28%29.md): Performs the operations in the last group on the redo stack, if there are any, recording them on the undo stack as a single group.
