# registerUndo(withTarget:selector:object:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Foundation  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 3.0+ · iPadOS 3.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.0+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

Registers the selector of the specified target to implement a single undo operation that the target receives.

## Declaration

```swift
func registerUndo(withTarget target: Any, selector: Selector, object: Any?)
```

## Parameters

- `target`: The target of the undo operation.

  The undo manager maintains an unowned reference to `target` to prevent retain cycles.
- `selector`: The selector for the undo operation.
- `object`: The argument sent with the selector.

  The undo manager maintains a strong reference to ```anO``bject```.

## Discussion

Use [registerUndo(withTarget:selector:object:)](registerundo%28withtarget_selector_object_%29.md) to register a selector for an undo operation.  To register a selector on the undo stack, you also need to make the method available to the Objective-C runtime by applying the @`objc` attribute to the method.  For more on how to create a selector, see [Selectors](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/InteractingWithObjective-CAPIs.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014216-CH4-ID59).

Calling this method also clears the redo stack.

The following example demonstrates how to register and use a selector on the undo stack by modeling a `Garden` class with two methods: `plant(flower:)` and `pluck(flower:)`.  The `plant(flower:)` method removes a flower from the garden while `pluck(flower:)` adds a flower such that effectively, the two methods are inverse operations of each other.  This inverse quality makes it ideal to register `plant(flower:)` and `pluck(flower:)` to be each other’s undo operation.

```swift
class Garden {
    typealias FlowerName = String

    var flowers: [FlowerName: Int]
    var manager = UndoManager()

    init(flowers: [FlowerName: Int]) {
        self.flowers = flowers
    }
    @objc func plant(flower: FlowerName) {
        flowers[flower, default: 0] += 1
        manager.registerUndo(withTarget: self, selector: #selector(pluck), object: flower)
    }
    @objc func pluck(flower: FlowerName) {
        flowers[flower, default: 0] -= 1
        manager.registerUndo(withTarget: self, selector: #selector(plant), object: flower)
    }
}
var garden = Garden(flowers: ["orchid" : 2, "lavender": 1, "violet": 2])
garden.pluck(flower: "orchid")
//garden.flowers == ["orchid" : 1, "lavender": 1, "violet": 2]
garden.manager.undo()
//garden.flowers == ["orchid" : 2, "lavender": 1, "violet": 2]
```

> **Important**

>  This method raises [internalInconsistencyException](../nsexceptionname/internalinconsistencyexception.md) if it’s called when no undo group has been established using [beginUndoGrouping()](beginundogrouping%28%29.md). Undo groups are usually set by default, and you rarely need to create a top-level undo group explicitly.
