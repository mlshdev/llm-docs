# registerCoercer(\_:selector:toConvertFrom:to:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Foundation  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.0+

Registers a given object (typically a class) to handle coercions (conversions) from one given class to another.

## Declaration

```swift
func registerCoercer(_ coercer: Any, selector: Selector, toConvertFrom fromClass: AnyClass, to toClass: AnyClass)
```

## Parameters

- `coercer`: The object that performs the coercion. `coercer` should typically be a class object.
- `selector`: A selector that specifies the method to perform the coercion. `selector` should typically be a factory method, and must take two arguments. The first is the value to be converted. The second is the class to convert it to.
- `fromClass`: The class for which instances are coerced.
- `toClass`: The class to which instances of `fromClass` are coerced.

### Working with handlers

- [coerceValue(\_:to:)](coercevalue%28__to_%29.md): Returns an object of a given class representing a given value.
