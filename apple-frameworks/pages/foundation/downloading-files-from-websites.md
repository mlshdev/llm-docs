# Downloading files from websites (Swift)

**Framework:** Foundation  
**Kind:** Article

Download files directly to the filesystem.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

For network resources that are already stored as files, like images and documents, you can use download tasks to fetch these items directly to the local filesystem.

> **Tip**

>  You can also configure download tasks to operate while your application is suspended or terminated in the background. See [Downloading files in the background](downloading-files-in-the-background.md) for details.

<a id="For-simple-downloads-use-a-completion-handler"></a>

### For simple downloads, use a completion handler

To download files, you create a [URLSessionDownloadTask](urlsessiondownloadtask.md) from a [URLSession](urlsession.md). If you don’t care about receiving progress updates or other delegate callbacks during the download, you can use a completion handler. The task calls the completion handler when the download ends, either at the end of a successful download or when downloading fails.

Your completion handler may receive a client-side error, indicating a local problem like not being able to reach the network. If there is no client-side error, you also receive a [URLResponse](urlresponse.md), which you should inspect to ensure that it indicates a successful response from the server.

If the download is successful, your completion handler receives a URL indicating the location of the downloaded file on the local filesystem. This storage is temporary. If you want to preserve the file, you *must* copy or move it from this location before returning from the completion handler.

The following example shows a simple example of creating a download task with a completion handler. If no errors are indicated, the completion handler moves the downloaded file to the app’s `Documents` directory. Start the task by calling [resume()](urlsessiontask/resume%28%29.md).

Creating a download task with a completion handler

```swift
let downloadTask = URLSession.shared.downloadTask(with: url) {
    urlOrNil, responseOrNil, errorOrNil in
    // check for and handle errors:
    // * errorOrNil should be nil
    // * responseOrNil should be an HTTPURLResponse with statusCode in 200..<299
    
    guard let fileURL = urlOrNil else { return }
    do {
        let documentsURL = try
            FileManager.default.url(for: .documentDirectory,
                                    in: .userDomainMask,
                                    appropriateFor: nil,
                                    create: false)
        let savedURL = documentsURL.appendingPathComponent(fileURL.lastPathComponent)
        try FileManager.default.moveItem(at: fileURL, to: savedURL)
    } catch {
        print ("file error: \(error)")
    }
}
downloadTask.resume()

```

> **Tip**

>  The previous example creates the download task with [downloadTask(with:)](urlsession/downloadtask%28with_%29-1onj.md), which simply takes a [URL](url.md) parameter. If you need to customize the request you send to the server, create the task with [downloadTask(with:)](urlsession/downloadtask%28with_%29-3fb7s.md) and pass in a customized [URLRequest](urlrequest.md).

### To receive progress updates, use a delegate

If you want to receive progress updates as the download proceeds, you must use a delegate. Instead of receiving the results in a completion handler, you receive callbacks to your implementations of methods from the [URLSessionTaskDelegate](urlsessiontaskdelegate.md) and [URLSessionDownloadDelegate](urlsessiondownloaddelegate.md) protocols.

Create your own [URLSession](urlsession.md) instance, and set its `delegate` property. The following example shows a lazily instantiated `urlSession` property that sets `self` as its delegate.

Creating a URL session with a delegate

```swift
private lazy var urlSession = URLSession(configuration: .default,
                                         delegate: self,
                                         delegateQueue: nil)

```

To start downloading, use this [URLSession](urlsession.md) to create a [URLSessionDownloadTask](urlsessiondownloadtask.md), and then start the task by calling [resume()](urlsessiontask/resume%28%29.md), as shown in in the following example.

Creating and starting a download task that uses a delegate

```swift
private func startDownload(url: URL) {
    let downloadTask = urlSession.downloadTask(with: url)
    downloadTask.resume()
    self.downloadTask = downloadTask
}

```

<a id="Receive-progress-updates"></a>

### Receive progress updates

Once the download starts, you receive periodic progress updates in the [URLSessionDownloadDelegate](urlsessiondownloaddelegate.md) method [urlSession(\_:downloadTask:didWriteData:totalBytesWritten:totalBytesExpectedToWrite:)](urlsessiondownloaddelegate/urlsession%28__downloadtask_didwritedata_totalbyteswritten_totalbytesexpectedtowrite_%29.md). You can use the byte counts provided by this callback to update a progress UI in your app.

The following example shows an implementation of this callback method. This implementation calculates the fractional progress of the download, and uses it to update a label that shows progress as a percentage. Because the callback is performed on an unknown Grand Central Dispatch queue, you *must* explicitly perform the UI update on the main queue.

Using a delegate method to update download progress in a UI

```swift
func urlSession(_ session: URLSession,
                downloadTask: URLSessionDownloadTask,
                didWriteData bytesWritten: Int64,
                totalBytesWritten: Int64,
                totalBytesExpectedToWrite: Int64) {
     if downloadTask == self.downloadTask {
        let calculatedProgress = Float(totalBytesWritten) / Float(totalBytesExpectedToWrite)
        DispatchQueue.main.async {
            self.progressLabel.text = self.percentFormatter.string(from:
                NSNumber(value: calculatedProgress))
        }
    }
}
```

> **Tip**

>  If the only UI update you need to perform during the download is to update a [UIProgressView](../uikit/uiprogressview.md), then use the task’s [progress](urlsessiontask/progress.md) property instead of performing your own progress calculations. This property is an instance of [Progress](progress.md) that you can assign to the [UIProgressView](../uikit/uiprogressview.md) property [observedProgress](../uikit/uiprogressview/observedprogress.md) when you create the task to get automatic updating of the progress view.

### Handle download completion or errors in your delegate

When you use a delegate instead of a completion handler, you handle the completion of the download by implementing [urlSession(\_:downloadTask:didFinishDownloadingTo:)](urlsessiondownloaddelegate/urlsession%28__downloadtask_didfinishdownloadingto_%29.md). Check the `downloadTask`‘s [response](urlsessiontask/response.md) property to ensure that the server response indicates success. If so, the `location` parameter provides a local URL where the file has been stored. This location is valid only until the end of the callback. This means you *must* either read the file immediately, or move it to another location such as the app’s `Documents` directory before you return from the callback method. The following example shows how to preserve the downloaded file.

Saving the downloaded file in the delegate callback

```swift
func urlSession(_ session: URLSession,
                downloadTask: URLSessionDownloadTask,
                didFinishDownloadingTo location: URL) {
    // check for and handle errors:
    // * downloadTask.response should be an HTTPURLResponse with statusCode in 200..<299

    do {
        let documentsURL = try
            FileManager.default.url(for: .documentDirectory,
                                    in: .userDomainMask,
                                    appropriateFor: nil,
                                    create: false)
        let savedURL = documentsURL.appendingPathComponent(
            location.lastPathComponent)
        try FileManager.default.moveItem(at: location, to: savedURL)
    } catch {
        // handle filesystem error
    }
}

```

If a client-side error occurs, your delegate receives it in a callback to the [urlSession(\_:task:didCompleteWithError:)](urlsessiontaskdelegate/urlsession%28__task_didcompletewitherror_%29.md) delegate method. On the other hand, if the download completes successfully, this method is called after [urlSession(\_:downloadTask:didFinishDownloadingTo:)](urlsessiondownloaddelegate/urlsession%28__downloadtask_didfinishdownloadingto_%29.md) and the error is `nil`.

    } catch {
        print ("file error: \(error)")
    }
}

If a client-side error occurs, your delegate receives it in a callback to the [URLSession:task:didCompleteWithError:](urlsessiontaskdelegate/urlsession%28__task_didcompletewitherror_%29.md) delegate method. On the other hand, if the download completes successfully, this method is called after [URLSession:downloadTask:didFinishDownloadingToURL:](urlsessiondownloaddelegate/urlsession%28__downloadtask_didfinishdownloadingto_%29.md) and the error is `nil`.
