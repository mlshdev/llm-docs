# personNameComponents(from:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Foundation  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 10.0+ · iPadOS 10.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.12+ · tvOS 10.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 3.0+

Returns a person name components object from a given string.

## Declaration

```swift
func personNameComponents(from string: String) -> PersonNameComponents?
```

## Parameters

- `string`: A string that is parsed to create a person name components object.

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

An [NSPersonNameComponents](../nspersonnamecomponents.md) object parsing string using the receiver’s format, or `nil` if no components could be parsed.

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

This method uses a combination of locale rules and heuristics to determine the most likely name components for a particular string representation. Parsing name components from a representation created for an existing name components object may not produce equivalent results.

> **Important**

>  Currently, only names using Latin or CJK scripts are supported.

Here are some general rules that describe the name component parsing behavior:

- Names in Latin script have components delimited by whitespace.
- Names with a single delimited component are parsed into their most likely name component.
- Names in Latin script with more than two delimited components may include middle components in the `givenName`, `middleName`, or `familyName` name components.
- Names in Latin script that are inverted may be parsed into components in a different order than they appear; names in CJK script that are inverted will not typically produce the correct results.
- Names in Latin script may use a comma to indicate name inversion.
- Names in Latin script have capitalization preserved between string representation and parsed components.
- Text between parentheses or brackets, as well as extraneous characters in names is ignored.
