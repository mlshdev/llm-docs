# URLSessionTaskTransactionMetrics (Swift)

**Framework:** Foundation  
**Kind:** Class  
**Availability:** iOS 10.0+ · iPadOS 10.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.12+ · tvOS 10.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 3.0+

An object that encapsualtes the performance metrics collected by the URL Loading System during the execution of a session task.

## Declaration

```swift
class URLSessionTaskTransactionMetrics
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Each [URLSessionTaskTransactionMetrics](urlsessiontasktransactionmetrics.md) object consists of a [request](urlsessiontasktransactionmetrics/request.md) and [response](urlsessiontasktransactionmetrics/response.md) property, corresponding to the request and response of the corresponding task. It also contains temporal metrics, starting with [fetchStartDate](urlsessiontasktransactionmetrics/fetchstartdate.md) and ending with [responseEndDate](urlsessiontasktransactionmetrics/responseenddate.md), as well as other characteristics like [networkProtocolName](urlsessiontasktransactionmetrics/networkprotocolname.md) and [resourceFetchType](urlsessiontasktransactionmetrics/resourcefetchtype.md).

### Understanding temporal metrics

The figure below shows the sequence of events for a URL session task, which correspond to the temporal metrics captured by [URLSessionTaskTransactionMetrics](urlsessiontasktransactionmetrics.md).

![Diagram showing the temporal metrics for a URL session task. When a task starts, it performs a DNS lookup and then starts a connection. If the connection is encrypted, the user agent starts a TLS security handshake to secure the connection. After the connection to the server is established, the user agent requests the specified resource, and receives a response.](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.foundation/media-3162616@2x.png)

For all metrics with a start and end date, if an aspect of the task was not completed, then its corresponding end date metric is `nil`. This can happen if name lookup begins, but the operation either times out, fails, or the client cancels the task before the name can be resolved. In this case, the [domainLookupEndDate](urlsessiontasktransactionmetrics/domainlookupenddate.md) property is `nil`, along with all metrics for aspects that occurred afterwards.

### Measuring tasks using iCloud Private Relay

iCloud Private Relay can change the timing and sequence of events for your tasks by sending requests through a set of privacy proxies. All tasks that use iCloud Private Relay set the [isProxyConnection](urlsessiontasktransactionmetrics/isproxyconnection.md) property in their transaction metrics. In this case, the [remoteAddress](urlsessiontasktransactionmetrics/remoteaddress.md) property contains the address of the proxy, and not the origin server.

Tasks to different hosts can reuse the same transport connection, just like how tasks can already share a connection when using HTTP/2. In these cases, a proxied task may not report any [secureConnectionStartDate](urlsessiontasktransactionmetrics/secureconnectionstartdate.md) or [secureConnectionEndDate](urlsessiontasktransactionmetrics/secureconnectionenddate.md).
