## Discussion

When you no longer need access to a file or directory pointed to by a security-scoped URL, such as one returned by resolving a security-scoped bookmark, call this method on the URL to relinquish access. You can also use its Core Foundation equivalent, the [CFURLStopAccessingSecurityScopedResource(\_:)](../../corefoundation/cfurlstopaccessingsecurityscopedresource%28__%29.md) function.

You must balance each call to [startAccessingSecurityScopedResource()](startaccessingsecurityscopedresource%28%29.md) for a given security-scoped URL with a call to [stopAccessingSecurityScopedResource()](stopaccessingsecurityscopedresource%28%29.md). When you make the last balanced call to [stopAccessingSecurityScopedResource()](stopaccessingsecurityscopedresource%28%29.md), you immediately lose access to the resource in question.

> **Warning**

>  If you fail to relinquish your access to file-system resources when you no longer need them, your app leaks kernel resources. If sufficient kernel resources leak, your app loses its ability to add file-system locations to its sandbox, such as with Powerbox or security-scoped bookmarks, until relaunched.

If you call this method on a URL whose referenced resource you don’t have access to, nothing happens.

> **Version note**

>  Security-scoped bookmarks aren’t available in versions of macOS prior to OS X 10.7.3.
