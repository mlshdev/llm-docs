# Calendar.MatchingPolicy.nextTime

**Framework:** Foundation  
**Kind:** Case  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ · iPadOS 8.0+ · Mac Catalyst 8.0+ · macOS 10.10+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

If there is no matching time before the end of the next instance of the next higher component to the highest specified component in the `DateComponents` argument, the algorithm will return the next existing time which exists.

## Declaration

```swift
case nextTime
```

## Discussion

For example, during a daylight saving transition there may be no 2:37am. The result would then be 3:00am, if that does exist.

### Enumeration Cases

- [Calendar.MatchingPolicy.nextTimePreservingSmallerComponents](nexttimepreservingsmallercomponents.md): If specified, and there is no matching time before the end of the next instance of the next higher component to the highest specified component in the `DateComponents` argument, the method returns the next existing value of the missing component and preserves the lower components’ values (for example, no 2:37am results in 3:37am, if that exists).
- [Calendar.MatchingPolicy.previousTimePreservingSmallerComponents](previoustimepreservingsmallercomponents.md): If there is no matching time before the end of the next instance of the next higher component to the highest specified component in the `DateComponents` argument, the algorithm will return the previous existing value of the missing component and preserves the lower components’ values.
- [Calendar.MatchingPolicy.strict](strict.md): If specified, the algorithm travels as far forward or backward as necessary looking for a match.
