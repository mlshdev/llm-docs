## Discussion

For example, for English in the Gregorian calendar, returns `["1st quarter", "2nd quarter", "3rd quarter", "4th quarter"]`.

> **Note**

>  Stand-alone properties are for use in places like calendar headers. Non-stand-alone properties are for use in context (for example, “Saturday, November 12th”).

> **Note**

>  By default, Calendars have no locale set. If you wish to receive a localized answer, be sure to set the `locale` property first - most likely to `Locale.autoupdatingCurrent`.
