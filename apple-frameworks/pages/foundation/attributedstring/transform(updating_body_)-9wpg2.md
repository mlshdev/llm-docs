# transform(updating:body:)

**Framework:** Foundation  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 26.0+ · iPadOS 26.0+ · Mac Catalyst 26.0+ · macOS 26.0+ · tvOS 26.0+ · visionOS 26.0+ · watchOS 26.0+

Tracks the location of the selection throughout the mutation closure, updating the selection so it represents the same effective locations after the mutation.

## Declaration

```swift
mutating func transform<E>(updating selection: inout AttributedTextSelection, body: (inout AttributedString) throws(E) -> Void) throws(E) where E : Error
```

## Parameters

- `selection`: The selection to track throughout the `body` closure.
- `body`: A mutating operation, or set of operations, to perform on the value of `self`. The value of `self` is provided to the closure as an `inout AttributedString` that the closure should mutate directly. Do not capture the value of `self` in the provided closure - the closure should mutate the provided `inout` copy.

## Discussion

> **Note**

> If the mutation performed does not allow for tracking to succeed (such as replacing the provided inout variable with an entirely different `AttributedString`), the selection is reset to the fallback location at the end of the text.
