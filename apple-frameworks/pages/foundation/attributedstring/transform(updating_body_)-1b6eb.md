# transform(updating:body:)

**Framework:** Foundation  
**Kind:** Instance Method

Tracks the location of the provided range throughout the mutation closure, updating the provided range to one that represents the same effective locations after the mutation.

## Declaration

```swift
mutating func transform<E>(updating range: inout Range<AttributedString.Index>, body: (inout AttributedString) throws(E) -> Void) throws(E) where E : Error
```

## Parameters

- `range`: A range to track throughout the `body` closure.
- `body`: A mutating operation, or set of operations, to perform on the value of `self`. The value of `self` is provided to the closure as an `inout AttributedString` that the closure should mutate directly. Do not capture the value of `self` in the provided closure - the closure should mutate the provided `inout` copy.

## Discussion

If updating the provided range is not possible (tracking failed) then this function will fatal error. Use the `Optional`-returning variants to provide custom fallback behavior.
