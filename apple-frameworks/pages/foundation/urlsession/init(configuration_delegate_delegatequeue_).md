# init(configuration:delegate:delegateQueue:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Foundation  
**Kind:** Initializer  
**Availability:** iOS 7.0+ · iPadOS 7.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.9+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

Creates a session with the specified session configuration, delegate, and operation queue.

## Declaration

```swift
init(configuration: URLSessionConfiguration, delegate: (any URLSessionDelegate)?, delegateQueue queue: OperationQueue?)
```

## Parameters

- `configuration`: A configuration object that specifies certain behaviors, such as caching policies, timeouts, proxies, pipelining, TLS versions to support, cookie policies, and credential storage.

  See [URLSessionConfiguration](../urlsessionconfiguration.md) for more information.
- `delegate`: A session delegate object that handles requests for authentication and other session-related events.

  This delegate object is responsible for handling authentication challenges, for making caching decisions, and for handling other session-related events. If `nil`, the class should be used only with methods that take completion handlers.

  > **Important**

  >  The session object keeps a strong reference to the delegate until your app exits or explicitly invalidates the session. If you do not invalidate the session by calling the [invalidateAndCancel()](invalidateandcancel%28%29.md) or [finishTasksAndInvalidate()](finishtasksandinvalidate%28%29.md) method, your app leaks memory until it exits.
- `queue`: An operation queue for scheduling the delegate calls and completion handlers. The queue should be a serial queue, in order to ensure the correct ordering of callbacks. If `nil`, the session creates a serial operation queue for performing all delegate method calls and completion handler calls.
