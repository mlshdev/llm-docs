# remoteAddress (Swift)

**Framework:** Foundation  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 13.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 6.0+

The IP address string of the remote interface for the connection.

## Declaration

```swift
var remoteAddress: String? { get }
```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

For multipath protocols, this is the remote address of the initial flow. If the app didn’t use the connection, this value is `nil`.
