# dictionaryWithObjects:forKeys:

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** Foundation  
**Kind:** Type Method  
**Availability:** iOS 2.0+ · iPadOS 2.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.0+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

Creates a dictionary containing entries constructed from the contents of an array of keys and an array of values.

## Declaration

```objectivec
+ (instancetype) dictionaryWithObjects:(NSArray<id> *) objects forKeys:(NSArray<id<NSCopying>> *) keys;
```

## Parameters

- `objects`: An array containing the values for the new dictionary.
- `keys`: An array containing the keys for the new dictionary. Each key is copied (using [copyWithZone:](../nscopying/copy%28with_%29.md); keys must conform to the `NSCopying` protocol), and the copy is added to the dictionary.

## Return Value

A new dictionary containing entries constructed from the contents of `objects` and `keys`.

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

This method steps through the `objects` and `keys` arrays, creating entries in the new dictionary as it goes. An `NSInvalidArgumentException` is raised if objects and keys don’t have the same number of elements.
