**Framework:** Foundation  
**Kind:** Instance Property

```

## Discussion

This property contains the relative path of the receiver’s URL without resolving against its base URL. Any percent-encoded characters are not unescaped. If the path has a trailing slash it is stripped. If the receiver is an absolute URL, this property contains the same value as [path](path.md). If the receiver does not conform to RFC 1808, it contains `nil`.
