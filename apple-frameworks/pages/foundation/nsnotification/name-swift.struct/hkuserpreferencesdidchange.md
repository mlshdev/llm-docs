## Discussion

The preferred units are the units that the user prefers for a given measurement type. By default, the preferred units are based on the device’s current locale. For example, in the US, the preferred units for the [bodyMass](../../../healthkit/hkquantitytypeidentifier/bodymass.md) identifier are pounds. Other regions may use kilograms or stones. However, users can change their preferred units in the Health app at any time.

Each `HKHealthStore` object posts its own `HKUserPreferencesDidChangeNotification` notification. To avoid receiving duplicate notifications, always pass a health store instance to the notification center when adding observers.
