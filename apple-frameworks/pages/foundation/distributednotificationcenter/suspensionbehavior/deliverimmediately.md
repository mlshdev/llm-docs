# DistributedNotificationCenter.SuspensionBehavior.deliverImmediately (Swift)

## Discussion

The server delivers notifications matching this registration irrespective of whether [suspended](../suspended.md) with an argument of [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true) has been called. When a notification with this suspension behavior is matched, it has the effect of first flushing any queued notifications. The effect is as if [suspended](../suspended.md) with an argument of [false](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false) were first called if the application is suspended, followed by the notification in question being delivered, followed by a transition back to the previous suspended or unsuspended state.

### Constants

- [DistributedNotificationCenter.SuspensionBehavior.drop](drop.md): The server doesn’t queue any notifications with this name and object until the notification center resumes notification delivery.
- [DistributedNotificationCenter.SuspensionBehavior.coalesce](coalesce.md): The server only queues the last notification of the specified name and object; earlier notifications are dropped. In cover methods for which suspension behavior is not an explicit argument, `NSNotificationSuspensionBehaviorCoalesce` is the default.
- [DistributedNotificationCenter.SuspensionBehavior.hold](hold.md): The server holds all matching notifications until the queue has been filled (queue size determined by the server), at which point the server may flush queued notifications.
