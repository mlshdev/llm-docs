# bitmapRepresentation (Swift)

**Framework:** Foundation  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 2.0+ · iPadOS 2.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.0+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

An `NSData` object encoding the receiver in binary format.

## Declaration

var bitmapRepresentation: Data { get }

A raw bitmap representation of a character set is a byte array with the first 2^16 bits (that is, 8192 bytes) representing the code point range of the the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP), such that the value of the bit at position n represents the presence in the character set of the character with decimal Unicode value n. A bitmap representation may contain zero to sixteen additional 8192 byte segments to for each additional Unicode plane containing a character in a character set, with each 8192 byte segment prepended with a single plane index byte.

For example, a character set containing only Basic Latin (ASCII) characters, which are contained by the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP, plane 0), has a bitmap representation with a size of 8192 bytes, whereas a character set containing both Basic Latin (ASCII) characters and emoji characters, which are contained by the Supplementary Multilingual Plane (SMP, plane 1), has a bitmap representation with a size of 16385 bytes (8192 bytes for BMP, followed by the byte `0x01` for the plane index of SMP, followed by 8192 bytes for SMP).

To test for the presence of a character in the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) with decimal Unicode value n in a raw bitmap representation, you might do the following:

```objc
unsigned char bitmapRep[8192];
if (bitmapRep[n >> 3] & (((unsigned int)1) << (n  & 7))) {
    /* Character is present. */
}
```
