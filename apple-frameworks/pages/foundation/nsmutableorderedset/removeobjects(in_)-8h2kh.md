# removeObjects(in:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Foundation  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 2.0+ · iPadOS 2.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.0+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

Removes the objects in the array from the mutable ordered set.

## Declaration

```swift
func removeObjects(in array: [Any])
```

## Parameters

- `array`: An array containing the objects to be removed from the receiving mutable ordered set.

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

This method is similar to [remove(\_:)](remove%28__%29.md), but allows you to efficiently remove large sets of objects with a single operation. If the receiving mutable ordered set does not contain objects in array, the method has no effect (although it does incur the overhead of searching the contents).

This method assumes that all elements in array respond to [hash](../../objectivec/nsobjectprotocol/hash.md) and [isEqual(\_:)](../../objectivec/nsobjectprotocol/isequal%28__%29.md).

This method is similar to [removeObject:](remove%28__%29.md), but allows you to efficiently remove large sets of objects with a single operation. If the receiving mutable ordered set does not contain objects in array, the method has no effect (although it does incur the overhead of searching the contents).
