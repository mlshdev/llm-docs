# setReceiversSpecifier(\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Foundation  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.0+

## Declaration

```swift

```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

When the command is executed, it sets attributes or relationships in the objects specified by `receiversRef`.

This method overrides [receiversSpecifier](../nsscriptcommand/receiversspecifier.md) in [NSScriptCommand](../nsscriptcommand.md). It performs the same function as the overridden method, with a critical difference: it causes the container specifier part of the passed-in object specifier to become the receiver specifier of the command, and the key part of the passed-in object specifier to become the key specifier. If, for example, `receiversRef` is a specifier for `the color of the third rectangle`, the receiver specifier is `the third rectangle,` while the key specifier is `the color`.
