# associatedIndex (Swift)

**Framework:** Foundation  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 13.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 6.0+

When this property is set to a value other than [NSNotFound](../nsnotfound-9t5v2.md), the receiver is one half of a move, and this value is the index of the change’s counterpart of the opposite type in the diff.

## Declaration

```swift
var associatedIndex: Int { get }
```

## Discussion

Pairs of changes with opposite types that refer to each other represent the index location of their counterpart with the [associatedIndex](associatedindex.md) property. The following example creates a diff where the object `@”Red”` moves from index `8` to index `3`:

```objc
NSOrderedCollectionDifference *diff = [[NSOrderedCollectionDifference alloc] initWithChanges:@[
    [NSOrderedCollectionChange changeWithObject:@"Red" type:NSCollectionChangeRemove index:8 associatedIndex:3],
    [NSOrderedCollectionChange changeWithObject:@"Red" type:NSCollectionChangeInsert index:3 associatedIndex:8]
]];
```

A move pair can have a different `object` in its removal and insertion changes, which can imply that the change represents moving and changing or replacing an element. Diffs that [controller(\_:didChangeContentWith:)](../../coredata/nsfetchedresultscontrollerdelegate/controller%28__didchangecontentwith_%29-5ullb.md) passes to delegates of [NSFetchedResultsController](../../coredata/nsfetchedresultscontroller.md) communicate that an object changed even when its position in the results is unaffected.

> **Note**

>  Don’t ignore a move when the indexes of its changes are the same. The calculated difference from `@[@”A”, @”B”, @”C”]` to `@[@”C”, @”B”]` may legitimately produce a diff where the change removes the object at index 0 and the object at index 1 moves to index 1. Ignoring the move produces the incorrect result `@[@”B”, @”C”]`.
