**Interface language:** Objective-C

## Discussion

Use this method to send a single notification after dequeueing multiple entries with the [DequeueWithCoalesce](dequeuewithcoalesce.md) method. The [DequeueWithCoalesce](dequeuewithcoalesce.md) method doesn’t call the [DataServiced](dataserviced.md) handler automatically after removing an entry. Instead, you call this method after the successful removal of entries from the queue.
