# LOCALONLY

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** DriverKit  
**Kind:** Macro  
**Availability:** DriverKit · iOS · iPadOS · macOS

Tells the system that the class or method runs locally in the driver extension’s process space.

## Declaration

```objectivec
#define LOCALONLY
```

## Discussion

DriverKit adds this macro to classes and methods that cannot be called remotely by the kernel or other processes. Instead, you call the methods locally from your driver’s process space. When applied to a class, the macro affects all methods of that class.

When calling the superclass implementation of a local-only method, call `super` like you normally would. Don’t use the [SUPERDISPATCH](superdispatch.md) macro to call the inherited implementation.

- [OSRequiredCast](osrequiredcast.md): Casts the object to the specified type, stopping the process if the object isn’t of the correct type.
- [IMPL](impl.md): Tells the system that the superclass implementation of this method runs in the kernel.
- [TYPE](type.md): Annotates a method declaration to indicate that it conforms to an existing method signature.
- [QUEUENAME](queuename.md): Tells the system to execute a method on the dispatch queue with the specified name.
- [SUPERDISPATCH](superdispatch.md): Tells the system to execute the superclass’ implementation of the current method in the kernel.
