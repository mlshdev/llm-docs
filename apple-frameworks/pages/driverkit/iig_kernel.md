# IIG_KERNEL

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** DriverKit  
**Kind:** Macro  
**Availability:** DriverKit · iOS · iPadOS · macOS

Tells the system that the class or method runs inside the kernel.

## Declaration

```objectivec
#define IIG_KERNEL
```

## Discussion

DriverKit adds this macro to methods that must run inside the kernel’s process space. When overriding a method tagged with this macro, you must define your method using the [IMPL](impl.md) macro, which creates the necessary binding to bridge from your driver’s process space to the kernel implementation. When applied to a class, this macro affects all methods of the class.

Don’t apply this macro to your own classes and methods.
