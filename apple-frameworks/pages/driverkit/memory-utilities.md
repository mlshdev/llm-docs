# Memory Utilities

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** DriverKit  
**Kind:** API Collection

Allocate and deallocate memory and manage memory pointers in different address spaces.

## Topics

### Allocation

- [IONew](ionew.md): Allocates memory for an array of the specified type.
- [IONewZero](ionewzero.md): Allocates memory for an array of the specified type and zero-initializes that memory.
- [IOMalloc](iomalloc.md): Allocates the specified amount of general-purpose memory.
- [IOMallocZero](iomalloczero.md): Allocates the specified amount of general-purpose memory and zero-initializes it.
- [OSTypeAlloc](ostypealloc.md): Allocates memory for a named class.

### Deallocation

- [IODelete](iodelete.md): Frees the memory associated with a valid, typed array.
- [IOSafeDeleteNULL](iosafedeletenull.md): Frees the memory associated with a typed array.
- [OSSafeReleaseNULL](ossafereleasenull.md): Frees memory that you allocated for a named class.
- [IOFree](iofree.md): Frees a memory block that contains general-purpose memory.

### Address Utilities

- [IOVMPageSize](iovmpagesize.md): The number of bytes in a virtual memory page.

### Addresses

- [IOVirtualAddress](iovirtualaddress.md): An address in the virtual memory space of the process.
- [IOPhysicalAddress](iophysicaladdress.md): An address in physical memory.
- [IOPhysicalAddress32](iophysicaladdress32.md): A 32-bit address in physical memory.
- [IOPhysicalAddress64](iophysicaladdress64.md): A 64-bit address in physical memory.
- [IOPhysicalLength](iophysicallength.md): A type that represents the length of a memory block.
- [IOPhysicalLength32](iophysicallength32.md): A type that represents the length of a memory block in a 32-bit address space.
- [IOPhysicalLength64](iophysicallength64.md): A type that represents the length of a memory block in a 64-bit address space.
- [IOCacheMode](iocachemode.md): A memory-cache mode.

### Byte Counts

- [IOByteCount](iobytecount.md): A type that represents a number of bytes.
- [IOByteCount32](iobytecount32.md): A type that represents a number of bytes in a 32-bit address space.
- [IOByteCount64](iobytecount64.md): A type that represents a number of bytes in a 64-bit address space.

### Memory management

- [IOBufferMemoryDescriptor](iobuffermemorydescriptor.md): A memory buffer allocated in the caller’s address space.
- [IOMemoryDescriptor](iomemorydescriptor.md): The base class for describing a location in memory.
- [IOMemoryMap](iomemorymap.md): A reference to an existing block of memory in the current process or in a different process.
