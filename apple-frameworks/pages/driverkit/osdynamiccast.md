# OSDynamicCast

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** DriverKit  
**Kind:** Macro  
**Availability:** DriverKit · iOS · iPadOS · macOS

Casts an object safely to the specified type, if possible.

## Declaration

```objectivec
#define OSDynamicCast(type, inst)
```

## Parameters

- `type`: The name of the desired class type as a raw token, not as a string or macro.
- `inst`: The object to cast to the specified type.

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

The object cast to the specified type, or `NULL` if the cast could not be performed safely.

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

Use this macro instead of the standard C++ RTTI type-casting operator to cast objects to specific types. The following example shows how to cast some object to the [OSString](osstring.md) class. If the object cannot be cast to a string, the macro sets the `string` variable to `NULL`.

```objc
OSString string = OSDynamicCast(OSString, anObject)
```

### Runtime support

- [OSRequiredCast](osrequiredcast.md): Casts the object to the specified type, stopping the process if the object isn’t of the correct type.
- [IMPL](impl.md): Tells the system that the superclass implementation of this method runs in the kernel.
- [TYPE](type.md): Annotates a method declaration to indicate that it conforms to an existing method signature.
- [QUEUENAME](queuename.md): Tells the system to execute a method on the dispatch queue with the specified name.
- [SUPERDISPATCH](superdispatch.md): Tells the system to execute the superclass’ implementation of the current method in the kernel.
- [IIG_KERNEL](iig_kernel.md): Tells the system that the class or method runs inside the kernel.
- [LOCAL](local.md): Tells the system that the method runs locally in the driver extension’s process space.
- [LOCALONLY](localonly.md): Tells the system that the class or method runs locally in the driver extension’s process space.
- [Error Codes](error-codes.md): Determine the reason an operation fails.
