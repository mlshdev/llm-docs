# LOCAL

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** DriverKit

#define LOCAL
```

## Discussion

DriverKit adds this macro to methods that must run locally in your driver extension. A method tagged with this macro may still be called by a remote process such as the kernel. Don’t add this macro to your own methods.

This macro applies only to methods.
