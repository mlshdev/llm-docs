# IOSafeDeleteNULL

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** DriverKit  
**Kind:** Macro  
**Availability:** DriverKit · iOS · iPadOS · macOS

Frees the memory associated with a typed array.

## Declaration

```objectivec
#define IOSafeDeleteNULL(ptr, type, count)
```

## Parameters

- `ptr`: The pointer to the memory block to free. You may specify `NULL` for this parameter. After freeing the memory, the macro sets the value of `ptr` to `NULL`.
- `type`: The data type stored in the memory block. The macro uses the type to determine its size.
- `count`: The number of array entries in the memory block

## Discussion

Use this macro to free memory that you allocated with [IONew](ionew.md) or [IONewZero](ionewzero.md). If `ptr` is `NULL`, this macro doesn’t attempt to free the memory.
