## Overview

Workgroups allow multiple threads to coordinate activities for realtime operations.

Applications that open user clients to a DriverKit driver can send a workgroup to use in the driver.

The application will have to first create an workgroup object. The application then should copy the workgroup port with os_workgroup_copy_port(). To send the workgroup port to the driver, use:

const char \* name = “Work Group Name”; // This must match the name the driver used in IOWorkGroup::Create(). kern_return_t ret = IOConnectTrap3(connect, // user client connection (io_connect_t) 1, // specifies event link configuration trap (uintptr_t)name, (uintptr_t)strlen(name), (uintptr_t)wgPort // port from os_workgroup_copy_port );

Once the workgroup port has been sent to the driver, the driver should be notified with a user-defined external method or other existing signaling mechanism.
