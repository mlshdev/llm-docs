## Discussion

Release and forget unused buffers

::handleSwapCleanup() is responsible for deallocating the buffers no longer used after a swap.  It must always be called if SwapPrepare() completes successfully.  Because bufers may be swapped in and out of existance, the \_swap\* variables may be NULL and should be set to NULL when complete.

Locking: The caller must ensure that the *config* lock is HELD but that the reporter (data) lock is *NOT HELD*.
