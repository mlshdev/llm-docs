# safeAreaInsets (Swift)

**Framework:** UIKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 11.0+ · iPadOS 11.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · tvOS 11.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

The insets that you use to determine the safe area for this view.

## Declaration

```swift
var safeAreaInsets: UIEdgeInsets { get }
```

## Discussion

The safe area of a view reflects the area not covered by navigation bars, tab bars, toolbars, and other ancestors that obscure a view controller’s view. (In tvOS, the safe area reflects the area not covered by the screen’s bezel.) You obtain the safe area for a view by applying the insets in this property to the view’s bounds rectangle. If the view is not currently installed in a view hierarchy, or is not yet visible onscreen, the edge insets in this property are `0`.

For the view controller’s root view, the insets account for the status bar, other visible bars, and any additional insets that you specified using the [additionalSafeAreaInsets](../uiviewcontroller/additionalsafeareainsets.md) property of your view controller. For other views in the view hierarchy, the insets reflect only the portion of the view that is covered. For example, if a view is entirely within the safe area of its superview, the edge insets in this property are `0`.

You might use this property at runtime to adjust the position of your view’s content programmatically.
