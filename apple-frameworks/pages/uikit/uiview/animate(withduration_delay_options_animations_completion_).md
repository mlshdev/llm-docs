# animate(withDuration:delay:options:animations:completion:) (Swift)

**Framework:** UIKit  
**Kind:** Type Method  
**Availability:** iOS 4.0+ · iPadOS 4.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · tvOS · visionOS 1.0+

Animate changes to one or more views using the specified duration, delay, options, and completion handler.

## Declaration

```swift
class func animate(withDuration duration: TimeInterval, delay: TimeInterval, options: UIView.AnimationOptions = [], animations: @escaping () -> Void, completion: ((Bool) -> Void)? = nil)
```

## Parameters

- `duration`: The total duration of the animations, measured in seconds. If you specify a negative value or `0`, the changes are made without animating them.
- `delay`: The amount of time (measured in seconds) to wait before beginning the animations. Specify a value of `0` to begin the animations immediately.
- `options`: A mask of options indicating how you want to perform the animations. For a list of valid constants, see [UIView.AnimationOptions](animationoptions.md).
- `animations`: A block object containing the changes to commit to the views. This is where you programmatically change any animatable properties of the views in your view hierarchy. This block takes no parameters and has no return value. This parameter must not be `NULL`.
- `completion`: A block object to be executed when the animation sequence ends. This block has no return value and takes a single Boolean argument that indicates whether or not the animations actually finished before the completion handler was called. If the duration of the animation is 0, this block is performed at the beginning of the next run loop cycle. This parameter may be `NULL`.

## Discussion

This method initiates a set of animations to perform on the view. The block object in the `animations` parameter contains the code for animating the properties of one or more views.

During an animation, user interactions are temporarily disabled for the views being animated. (Prior to iOS 5, user interactions are disabled for the entire application.) If you want users to be able to interact with the views, include the [allowUserInteraction](animationoptions/allowuserinteraction.md) constant in the `options` parameter.

**Framework:** UIKit  
**Kind:** Type Method  
**Availability:** iOS 4.0+ · iPadOS 4.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · tvOS · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

## Parameters

During an animation, user interactions are temporarily disabled for the views being animated. (Prior to iOS 5, user interactions are disabled for the entire application.) If you want users to be able to interact with the views, include the [UIViewAnimationOptionAllowUserInteraction](animationoptions/allowuserinteraction.md) constant in the `options` parameter.
