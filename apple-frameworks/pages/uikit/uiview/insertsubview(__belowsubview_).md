# insertSubview(\_:belowSubview:) (Swift)

**Framework:** UIKit  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS · iPadOS · Mac Catalyst · tvOS · visionOS

Inserts a view below another view in the view hierarchy.

## Declaration

```swift
func insertSubview(_ view: UIView, belowSubview siblingSubview: UIView)
```

## Parameters

- `view`: The view to insert below another view. It’s removed from its superview if it’s not a sibling of  `siblingSubview`.
- `siblingSubview`: The sibling view that will be above the inserted view.

## Discussion

This method establishes a strong reference to `view` and sets its next responder to the receiver, which is its new superview.

Views can have only one superview. If `view` already has a superview and that view is not the receiver, this method removes the previous superview before making the receiver its new superview.

- [addSubview(\_:)](addsubview%28__%29.md): Adds a view to the end of the receiver’s list of subviews.
- [bringSubviewToFront(\_:)](bringsubviewtofront%28__%29.md): Moves the specified subview so that it appears on top of its siblings.
- [sendSubviewToBack(\_:)](sendsubviewtoback%28__%29.md): Moves the specified subview so that it appears behind its siblings.
- [removeFromSuperview()](removefromsuperview%28%29.md): Unlinks the view from its superview and its window, and removes it from the responder chain.
- [insertSubview(\_:at:)](insertsubview%28__at_%29.md): Inserts a subview at the specified index.
- [insertSubview(\_:aboveSubview:)](insertsubview%28__abovesubview_%29.md): Inserts a view above another view in the view hierarchy.
- [exchangeSubview(at:withSubviewAt:)](exchangesubview%28at_withsubviewat_%29.md): Exchanges the subviews at the specified indices.
- [isDescendant(of:)](isdescendant%28of_%29.md): Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the receiver is a subview of a given view or identical to that view.
