# anchorPoint (Swift)

**Framework:** UIKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 16.0+ · iPadOS 16.0+ · Mac Catalyst 16.0+ · tvOS 16.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

The anchor point of the view’s bounds rectangle.

## Declaration

```swift
var anchorPoint: CGPoint { get set }
```

## Discussion

You specify the value for this property using the unit coordinate space, where (`0`, `0`) is the bottom-left corner of the view’s [bounds](../../quartzcore/calayer/bounds.md) rectangle, and (`1`, `1`) is the top-right corner. The default value of this property is (`0.5`, `0.5`), which represents the center of the view’s [bounds](../../quartzcore/calayer/bounds.md) rectangle.

All geometric manipulations to the view occur about the specified point. For example, applying a rotation transform to a view with the default anchor point causes the view to rotate around its center. Changing the anchor point to a different location causes the view to rotate around that new point.

### Configuring the bounds and frame rectangles

- [frame](frame.md): The frame rectangle, which describes the view’s location and size in its superview’s coordinate system.
- [bounds](bounds.md): The bounds rectangle, which describes the view’s location and size in its own coordinate system.
- [center](center.md): The center point of the view’s frame rectangle.
- [transform](transform.md): Specifies the transform applied to the view, relative to the center of its bounds.
- [transform3D](transform3d.md): The three-dimensional transform to apply to the view.
