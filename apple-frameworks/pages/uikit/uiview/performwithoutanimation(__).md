- [animate(springDuration:bounce:initialSpringVelocity:delay:options:animations:completion:)](animate%28springduration_bounce_initialspringvelocity_delay_options_animations_completion_%29.md): Animates changes to one or more views using a spring animation with the specified duration, bounce, initial velocity, delay, options, and completion handler.
- [animate(withDuration:delay:options:animations:completion:)](animate%28withduration_delay_options_animations_completion_%29.md): Animate changes to one or more views using the specified duration, delay, options, and completion handler.

- [perform(\_:on:options:animations:completion:)](perform%28__on_options_animations_completion_%29.md): Performs a specified system-provided animation on one or more views, along with optional parallel animations that you define.
- [animate(withDuration:delay:usingSpringWithDamping:initialSpringVelocity:options:animations:completion:)](animate%28withduration_delay_usingspringwithdamping_initialspringvelocity_options_animations_completion_%29.md): Performs a view animation using a timing curve corresponding to the motion of a physical spring.
- [modifyAnimations(withRepeatCount:autoreverses:animations:)](modifyanimations%28withrepeatcount_autoreverses_animations_%29.md): Repeats the specified animations a specific number of times, optionally running the animation forward and backward.
