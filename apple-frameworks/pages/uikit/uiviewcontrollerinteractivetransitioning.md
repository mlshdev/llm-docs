# UIViewControllerInteractiveTransitioning (Swift)

**Framework:** UIKit  
**Kind:** Protocol  
**Availability:** iOS · iPadOS · Mac Catalyst · tvOS · visionOS

A set of methods that enable an object (such as a navigation controller) to drive a view controller transition.

## Declaration

```swift
@MainActor protocol UIViewControllerInteractiveTransitioning : NSObjectProtocol
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

An *interactive transition delegate* (which is the term for an object that supports this protocol) can respond to touch events, or to time-varying programmatic input, by speeding up, slowing down, or even reversing the progress of a view controller transition. For example, an interactive transition on a navigation controller could respond to a swipe gesture by moving a view controller onto or off of the navigation stack.

To support an interactive view controller transition, you must also provide a transition animator delegate, which is a custom object that adopts the [UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning](uiviewcontrolleranimatedtransitioning.md) protocol. The transition delegate and the transition animator can, if you wish, be defined within a single custom class, but the class must adopt both protocols.

If you instead want to provide a fixed-duration animated view controller transition — one that doesn’t support user interaction — use a transition animator delegate on its own. Refer to [UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning](uiviewcontrolleranimatedtransitioning.md).

For the methods you can call to retrieve view transition context information from within your [startInteractiveTransition(\_:)](uiviewcontrollerinteractivetransitioning/startinteractivetransition%28__%29.md) method, refer to [UIViewControllerContextTransitioning](uiviewcontrollercontexttransitioning.md).

## Topics

### Starting an interactive transition

- [startInteractiveTransition(\_:)](uiviewcontrollerinteractivetransitioning/startinteractivetransition%28__%29.md): Called when the system needs to set up the interactive portions of a view controller transition and start the animations.
- [wantsInteractiveStart](uiviewcontrollerinteractivetransitioning/wantsinteractivestart.md): A Boolean value indicating whether the transition is interactive when it starts.

### Providing a transition’s completion characteristics

- [completionCurve](uiviewcontrollerinteractivetransitioning/completioncurve.md): Called when the system needs the animation completion curve for an interactive view controller transition.
- [completionSpeed](uiviewcontrollerinteractivetransitioning/completionspeed.md): Called when the system needs the speed at which to complete an interactive transition, after the interactive portion is finished.

## Relationships

### Inherits From

- [NSObjectProtocol](../objectivec/nsobjectprotocol.md)

### Conforming Types

- [UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition](uipercentdriveninteractivetransition.md)

## See Also

### Interactive transitions

- [UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition](uipercentdriveninteractivetransition.md): An object that drives an interactive animation between one view controller and another.
- [UIViewImplicitlyAnimating](uiviewimplicitlyanimating.md): An interface for modifying an animation while it’s running.
