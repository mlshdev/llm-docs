# UIDropOperation.copy (Swift)

**Framework:** UIKit  
**Kind:** Case  
**Availability:** iOS 11.0+ · iPadOS 11.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · visionOS 1.0+

A drop operation type specifying that the data represented by the drag items should be copied to the destination view.

## Declaration

```swift
case copy
```

## Discussion

This operation is used most often. When the user performs a drop activity, the [dropInteraction(\_:performDrop:)](../uidropinteractiondelegate/dropinteraction%28__performdrop_%29.md) delegate method is called. Your implementation of this delegate method should copy the data from the drag items to the destination view.

### Drop operation types

- [UIDropOperation.cancel](cancel.md): A drop operation type specifying that no data should be transferred, thereby canceling the drag.
- [UIDropOperation.forbidden](forbidden.md): A drop operation type specifying that, although a move or copy operation is typically legitimate in this scenario, the drop activity isn’t allowed.
- [UIDropOperation.move](move.md): A drop operation type specifying that the data represented by the drag items should be moved, not copied.
