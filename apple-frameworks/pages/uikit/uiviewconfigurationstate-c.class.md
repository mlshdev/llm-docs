## Overview

A view configuration state encompasses a trait collection along with all of the common states that affect a view’s appearance — states like selected, focused, or disabled. A view configuration state encapsulates the inputs that configure a view for any possible state or combination of states. You use a view configuration state with background and content configurations to obtain the default appearance for a specific state.

Typically, you don’t create a configuration state yourself. To obtain a configuration state, override the [updateConfiguration(using:)](uicollectionviewcell/updateconfiguration%28using_%29.md) method in your view subclass and use the state parameter. Outside of this method, you can get a view’s configuration state by using its [configurationState](uicollectionviewcell/configurationstate-4u37h.md) property.

You can create your own custom states to add to a view configuration state by defining a custom state key using [UIConfigurationStateCustomKey](uiconfigurationstatecustomkey.md).

## Topics

### Managing view configuration states

- [traitCollection](uiviewconfigurationstate-c.class/traitcollection.md): The traits that describe the current layout environment of the view, such as the user interface style and layout direction.
- [selected](uiviewconfigurationstate-c.class/selected.md): A Boolean value that indicates whether the view is in a selected state.
- [highlighted](uiviewconfigurationstate-c.class/highlighted.md): A Boolean value that indicates whether the view is in a highlighted state.
- [focused](uiviewconfigurationstate-c.class/focused.md): A Boolean value that indicates whether the view is in a focused state.
- [disabled](uiviewconfigurationstate-c.class/disabled.md): A Boolean value that indicates whether the view is in a disabled state.
- [pinned](uiviewconfigurationstate-c.class/pinned.md): A Boolean value that indicates whether the view is in a pinned state.

### Creating a configuration state manually

- [initWithTraitCollection:](uiviewconfigurationstate-c.class/initwithtraitcollection_.md): Creates a view configuration state with the specified trait collection.
- [initWithCoder:](uiviewconfigurationstate-c.class/initwithcoder_.md): Creates a view configuration state from data in an unarchiver.
