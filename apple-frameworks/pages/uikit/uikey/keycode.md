# keyCode (Swift)

**Framework:** UIKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 13.4+ · iPadOS 13.4+ · Mac Catalyst 13.4+ · tvOS 13.4+ · visionOS 1.0+

The HID usage code of the key.

## Declaration

```swift
var keyCode: UIKeyboardHIDUsage { get }
```

## Discussion

Use this property to determine the HID (Human Interface Device) usage code that identifies the key of a USB (Universal Serial Bus) keyboard. For a list of HID usage codes, see [UIKeyboardHIDUsage](../uikeyboardhidusage.md).

Due to the variation of keyboards from language to language, it isn’t feasible to specify exact key mappings for every language. Where the HID usage code list isn’t specific for a key in a particular language, the keyboard firmware uses the closest equivalent key position so manufacturers can produce keyboards for different languages by simply printing different keycaps.

One example is the Y key on a North American keyboard. In Germany, the Z key typically occupies the Y key position. Rather than changing the keyboard firmware to put the Z usage code into that place in the descriptor list, the vendor uses the Y usage code on both the North American and German keyboards.

Because the key mapping may not be exact, use [charactersIgnoringModifiers](charactersignoringmodifiers.md) instead of [keyCode](keycode.md) to determine the text value of the key.
