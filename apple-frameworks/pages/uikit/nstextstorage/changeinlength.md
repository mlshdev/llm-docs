# changeInLength (Swift)

**Framework:** UIKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 7.0+ · iPadOS 7.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

The difference between the current length of the edited range and its length before editing.

## Declaration

```swift
var changeInLength: Int { get }
```

## Discussion

This property reflects difference between the current length of the edited range and its length before editing began—that is, before the first call to the [beginEditing()](../../foundation/nsmutableattributedstring/beginediting%28%29.md) method or a single call to the[edited(\_:range:changeInLength:)](edited%28__range_changeinlength_%29.md) method. This difference is accumulated with each call to the [edited(\_:range:changeInLength:)](edited%28__range_changeinlength_%29.md) method, until the changes are finally processed.

The text storage object’s delegate and layout managers can use this information to determine the nature of edits in their respective notification methods.
