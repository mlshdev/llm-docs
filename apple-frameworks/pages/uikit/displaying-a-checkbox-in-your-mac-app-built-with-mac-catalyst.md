# Displaying a checkbox in your Mac app built with Mac Catalyst (Swift)

**Framework:** UIKit  
**Kind:** Article

Present a switch control as a Mac-style checkbox when your app runs in the Mac user interface idiom.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

A Mac app built with Mac Catalyst that uses the Mac user interface idiom displays a [UISwitch](uiswitch.md) as a checkbox when the [preferredStyle](uiswitch/preferredstyle.md) value is [UISwitch.Style.automatic](uiswitch/style-swift.enum/automatic.md) (the default value) or [UISwitch.Style.checkbox](uiswitch/style-swift.enum/checkbox.md). If your app doesn’t use the [UIUserInterfaceIdiom.mac](uiuserinterfaceidiom/mac.md) idiom, the switch appears as a slider switch. To learn more, see [Choosing a user interface idiom for your Mac app](choosing-a-user-interface-idiom-for-your-mac-app.md).

### Add text to the checkbox

To display text alongside the checkbox, set the [title](uiswitch/title.md) property.

```swift
let showFavoritesAtTop = UISwitch()
showFavoritesAtTop.title = "Always show favorite recipes at the top"
```

<a id="Resize-the-checkbox"></a>

### Resize the checkbox

A checkbox-style switch has a default frame size of zero. If you’re not using Auto Layout to determine the size and position of the switch, call [sizeToFit()](uiview/sizetofit%28%29.md) to resize it so that it uses the appropriate amount of space needed to display the checkbox and its title.
