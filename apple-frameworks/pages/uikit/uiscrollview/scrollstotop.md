# scrollsToTop (Swift)

**Framework:** UIKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 2.0+ · iPadOS 2.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · visionOS 1.0+

A Boolean value that controls whether the scroll-to-top gesture is enabled.

## Declaration

```swift
var scrollsToTop: Bool { get set }
```

## Discussion

The scroll-to-top gesture is a tap on the status bar. When a user makes this gesture, the system asks the scroll view closest to the status bar to scroll to the top. If that scroll view has [scrollsToTop](scrollstotop.md) set to [false](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false), its delegate returns [false](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false) from [scrollViewShouldScrollToTop(\_:)](../uiscrollviewdelegate/scrollviewshouldscrolltotop%28__%29.md), or the content is already at the top, nothing happens.

After the scroll view scrolls to the top of the content view, it sends the delegate a [scrollViewDidScrollToTop(\_:)](../uiscrollviewdelegate/scrollviewdidscrolltotop%28__%29.md) message.

The default value of this property is [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true).

### Special considerations

On iPhone, the scroll-to-top gesture has no effect if there’s more than one scroll view onscreen that has [scrollsToTop](scrollstotop.md) set to [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true).
