### Implementing subclasses

- [touchesBegan(\_:with:)](touchesbegan%28__with_%29.md): Sent to the gesture recognizer when one or more fingers touch down in the associated view.
- [touchesMoved(\_:with:)](touchesmoved%28__with_%29.md): Sent to the gesture recognizer when one or more fingers move in the associated view.
- [touchesEnded(\_:with:)](touchesended%28__with_%29.md): Sent to the gesture recognizer when one or more fingers lift from the associated view.
- [touchesCancelled(\_:with:)](touchescancelled%28__with_%29.md): Sent to the gesture recognizer when a system event (such as an incoming phone call) cancels a touch event.
- [touchesEstimatedPropertiesUpdated(\_:)](touchesestimatedpropertiesupdated%28__%29.md): Sent to the gesture recognizer when the estimated properties for a touch have changed so that they are no longer estimated, or an update is no longer expected.
- [reset()](reset%28%29.md): Overridden to reset internal state when a gesture recognition attempt completes.
- [ignore(\_:for:)](ignore%28__for_%29-5f685.md): Tells the gesture recognizer to ignore a specific touch of the given event.
- [canBePrevented(by:)](canbeprevented%28by_%29.md): Overridden to indicate that the specified gesture recognizer can prevent the receiver from recognizing a gesture.
- [canPrevent(\_:)](canprevent%28__%29.md): Overridden to indicate that the receiver can prevent the specified gesture recognizer from recognizing its gesture.
- [shouldRequireFailure(of:)](shouldrequirefailure%28of_%29.md): Overridden to indicate that the receiver requires the specified gesture recognizer to fail.
- [shouldBeRequiredToFail(by:)](shouldberequiredtofail%28by_%29.md): Overridden to indicate that the receiver should be required to fail by the specified gesture recognizer.
- [ignore(\_:for:)](ignore%28__for_%29-8qqor.md): Tells the gesture recognizer to ignore a specific press of the given event.
- [pressesBegan(\_:with:)](pressesbegan%28__with_%29.md): Sent to the receiver when a physical button is pressed in the associated view.
- [pressesChanged(\_:with:)](presseschanged%28__with_%29.md): Sent to the receiver when the [force](../uipress/force.md) of the press has changed in the associated view.
- [pressesEnded(\_:with:)](pressesended%28__with_%29.md): Sent to the receiver when a button is released from the associated view.
