# delegate (Swift)

**Framework:** UIKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 2.0+ (deprecated in 12.0) · iPadOS 2.0+ (deprecated in 12.0) · Mac Catalyst 2.0+ (deprecated in 12.0)

The receiver’s delegate.

> For more information, see [UIWebView](../uiwebview.md).

## Declaration

```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

The delegate is sent messages when content is loading. See [UIWebViewDelegate](../uiwebviewdelegate.md) for the optional methods this delegate may implement.

> **Important**

>  Before releasing an instance of `UIWebView` for which you have set a delegate, you must first set its delegate property to `nil`. This can be done, for example, in your dealloc method.
