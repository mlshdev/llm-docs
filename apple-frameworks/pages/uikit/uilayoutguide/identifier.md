**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 9.0+ · iPadOS 9.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

A string used to identify the layout guide.

## Declaration

var identifier: String { get set }
```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

By default, the `identifier` property is an empty string. Assign a nonempty string to identify this layout guide. This string appears as part of the guide’s description when the guide is printed to the console. You can also use the identifier to find a particular layout guide from among the guides owned by a view.

Identifiers starting with “NS” or “UI” are reserved by the system. The system may assign these identifiers to the guides it creates.
