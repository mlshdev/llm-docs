# undoManager (Swift)

```

## Discussion

By default, every window of an application has an undo manager: a shared object for managing undo and redo operations. However, the class of any object in the responder chain can have their own custom undo manager. (For example, instances of [UITextField](../uitextfield.md) have their own undo manager that’s cleared when the text field resigns first-responder status.) When you request an undo manager, the request goes up the responder chain and the [UIWindow](../uiwindow.md) object returns a usable instance.

You may add undo managers to your view controllers to perform undo and redo operations local to the managed view.
