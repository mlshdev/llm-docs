# canPerformAction(\_:withSender:) (Swift)

**Framework:** UIKit  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 3.0+ · iPadOS 3.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · tvOS · visionOS 1.0+

Requests the receiving responder to enable or disable the specified command in the user interface.

## Declaration

```swift
func canPerformAction(_ action: Selector, withSender sender: Any?) -> Bool
```

## Parameters

- `action`: A selector that identifies a method associated with a command. For the editing menu, this is one of the editing methods declared by the UIResponderStandardEditActions informal protocol (for example, `copy:`).
- `sender`: The object calling this method. For the editing menu commands, this is the shared [UIApplication](../uiapplication.md) object. Depending on the context, you can query the sender for information to help you determine whether a command should be enabled.

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

[true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true) if the command identified by `action` should be enabled or [false](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false) if it should be disabled. Returning [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true) means that your class can handle the command in the current context.

## Discussion

This default implementation of this method returns [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true) if the responder class implements the requested action and calls the next responder if it doesn’t. Subclasses may override this method to enable menu commands based on the current state; for example, you would enable the Copy command if there’s a selection or disable the Paste command if the pasteboard didn’t contain data with the correct pasteboard representation type. If no responder in the responder chain returns [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true), the menu command is disabled. Note that if your class returns [false](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false) for a command, another responder further up the responder chain may still return [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true), enabling the command.

This method might be called more than once for the same action but with a different sender each time. You should be prepared for any kind of sender including `nil`.
