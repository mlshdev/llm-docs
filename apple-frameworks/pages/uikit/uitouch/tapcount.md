# tapCount (Swift)

**Framework:** UIKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 2.0+ · iPadOS 2.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · tvOS · visionOS 1.0+

The number of times the finger was tapped for this given touch.

## Declaration

```swift
var tapCount: Int { get }
```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

The value of this property is an integer containing the number of taps that occurred for this touch within a predefined period of time. Use this property to evaluate whether the user single-tapped, double-tapped, or even triple-tapped a particular view or window.

### Getting touch attributes

- [timestamp](timestamp.md): The time when the touch occurred or when it was last mutated.
- [type](type.md): The type of the touch.
- [UITouch.TouchType](touchtype.md): The type of touch received.
- [phase](phase-swift.property.md): The phase of the touch.
- [UITouch.Phase](phase-swift.enum.md): The phase of a touch event.
- [force](force.md): The force of the touch, where a value of `1.0` represents the force of an average touch (predetermined by the system, not user-specific).
- [maximumPossibleForce](maximumpossibleforce.md): The maximum possible force for a touch.
- [altitudeAngle](altitudeangle.md): The altitude (in radians) of the stylus.
- [azimuthAngle(in:)](azimuthangle%28in_%29.md): Returns the azimuth angle (in radians) of the stylus.
- [azimuthUnitVector(in:)](azimuthunitvector%28in_%29.md): Returns a unit vector that points in the direction of the azimuth of the stylus.
- [rollAngle](rollangle.md): A value that represents the current barrel-roll angle of Apple Pencil.
