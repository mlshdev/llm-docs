# UIPress (Swift)

**Framework:** UIKit  
**Kind:** Class  
**Availability:** iOS 9.0+ · iPadOS 9.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

An object that represents the presence or movement of a button press on the screen for a particular event.

## Declaration

```swift
class UIPress
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

The press specifically encapsulates the pressing of some physically actuated button. All of the press types represent actual physical buttons on one of a variety of remotes. You access [UIPress](uipress.md) objects through [UIEvent](uievent.md) objects passed into responder objects for event handling. The [gestureRecognizers](uipress/gesturerecognizers.md) property returns the gesture recognizers — instances of a concrete subclass of [UIGestureRecognizer](uigesturerecognizer.md) — that are currently handling the given button press.

## Topics

### Getting a press object’s gesture recognizers

- [force](uipress/force.md): The force of the button press.
- [gestureRecognizers](uipress/gesturerecognizers.md): The gesture recognizers that are receiving the press.

### Responding to press events

- [responder](uipress/responder.md): A responder object.

### Getting the press’s location

- [window](uipress/window.md): The window in which the press initially occurred.

### Getting press attributes

- [key](uipress/key.md): The key pressed or released on a physical keyboard.
- [type](uipress/type.md): The type of the specified press.
- [phase](uipress/phase-swift.property.md): The current press phase of the object.
- [timestamp](uipress/timestamp.md): The time when the press occurred or when it was last mutated.

### Constants

- [UIPress.Phase](uipress/phase-swift.enum.md): Constants that represent the phases of a button press.
- [UIPress.PressType](uipress/presstype.md): Constants that represent buttons that a person can press.
