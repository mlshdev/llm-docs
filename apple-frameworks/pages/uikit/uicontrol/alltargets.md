- [addTarget(\_:action:for:)](addtarget%28__action_for_%29.md): Associates a target object and action method with the control.
- [removeTarget(\_:action:for:)](removetarget%28__action_for_%29.md): Stops the delivery of events to the specified target object.
- [addAction(\_:for:)](addaction%28__for_%29.md): Adds the UIAction to a given event. UIActions are uniqued based on their identifier, and subsequent actions with the same identifier replace previously added actions. You may add multiple UIActions for corresponding controlEvents, and you may add the same action to multiple controlEvents.
- [removeAction(\_:for:)](removeaction%28__for_%29.md): Removes the action from the set of passed control events.
- [removeAction(identifiedBy:for:)](removeaction%28identifiedby_for_%29.md): Removes the action with the provided identifier from the set of passed control events.
- [actions(forTarget:forControlEvent:)](actions%28fortarget_forcontrolevent_%29.md): Returns the actions performed on a target object when the specified event occurs.
- [allControlEvents](allcontrolevents.md): Returns the events for which the control has associated actions.
- [enumerateEventHandlers(\_:)](enumerateeventhandlers%28__%29.md)
- [UIControl.Event](event.md): Constants describing the types of events possible for controls.
