## Discussion

TypeSelect lets users move focus to a matching menu option by typing on a hardware keyboard while the menu is open. When a context menu appears alongside a text field that actively receives keyboard input, TypeSelect can intercept keystrokes before they reach the text field.

Set this property to [false](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false) when the menu serves as a companion to an active text input, such as a suggestion menu or autocomplete picker. This allows keyboard input to flow to the text field without being captured by the menu’s navigation.

The default value is [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true).
