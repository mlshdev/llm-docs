# performBatchUpdates(\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** UIKit

## Discussion

Use this method when you need to make several changes to tab properties simultaneously. Changes made inside the `updates` block are coalesced into a single animated layout pass, preventing intermediate states from being visible to the user.

The `updates` block is called synchronously. You can safely read and write any mutable tab properties inside this block.

### Assigning tabs

- [tabs](tabs.md): An array of tabs that the tab bar displays.
- [setTabs(\_:animated:)](settabs%28__animated_%29.md): Sets the root tabs of the tab bar controller, with an option to animate the change.
