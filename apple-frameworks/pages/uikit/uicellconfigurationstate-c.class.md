## Overview

A cell configuration state encompasses a trait collection along with all of the common states that affect a cell’s appearance — view states like selected, focused, or disabled, and cell states like editing or swiped. A cell configuration state encapsulates the inputs that configure a cell for any possible state or combination of states. You use a cell configuration state with background and content configurations to obtain the default appearance for a specific state.

Typically, you don’t create a configuration state yourself. To obtain a configuration state, override the [updateConfiguration(using:)](uicollectionviewcell/updateconfiguration%28using_%29.md) method in your cell subclass and use the state parameter. Outside of this method, you can get a cell’s configuration state by using its [configurationState](uicollectionviewcell/configurationstate-4u37h.md) property.

You can create your own custom states to add to a cell configuration state by defining a custom state key using [UIConfigurationStateCustomKey](uiconfigurationstatecustomkey.md).

## Topics

### Managing cell configuration states

- [editing](uicellconfigurationstate-c.class/editing.md): A Boolean value that indicates whether the cell is in editing mode.
- [swiped](uicellconfigurationstate-c.class/swiped.md): A Boolean value that indicates whether the cell is in a swiped state.
- [expanded](uicellconfigurationstate-c.class/expanded.md): A Boolean value that indicates whether the cell is in an expanded state, such as in an outline.
- [reordering](uicellconfigurationstate-c.class/reordering.md): A Boolean value that indicates whether the cell is reordering.
- [cellDragState](uicellconfigurationstate-c.class/celldragstate.md): The cell’s drag state.
- [cellDropState](uicellconfigurationstate-c.class/celldropstate.md): The cell’s drop state.
- [UICellConfigurationDragState](uicellconfigurationdragstate.md): Constants that describe the cell’s drag state.
- [UICellConfigurationDropState](uicellconfigurationdropstate.md): Constants that describe the cell’s drop state.
