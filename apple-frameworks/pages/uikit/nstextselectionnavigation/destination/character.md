# NSTextSelectionNavigation.Destination.character (Swift)

**Framework:** UIKit  
**Kind:** Case  
**Availability:** iOS 15.0+ · iPadOS 15.0+ · Mac Catalyst 15.0+ · tvOS 15.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

The selection moves to the next extended grapheme cluster boundary.

## Declaration

```swift
case character
```

## Discussion

When the movement direction isn’t along the line (for example up and down for a horizontal line), it moves to the adjacent line using the anchor point instead of resolving to the logical direction. This could result in a location inside a cluster depending on the specific characteristics of a given script.  For example, certain Indic scripts combine characters in specific ways depending on usage and position to form composite characters. The framework returns a location consistent with the rules of the script and the direction of movement.
