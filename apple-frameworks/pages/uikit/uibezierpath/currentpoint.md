# currentPoint (Swift)

**Framework:** UIKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 3.2+ · iPadOS 3.2+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · tvOS · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

The current point in the graphics path.

## Declaration

```swift
var currentPoint: CGPoint { get }
```

## Discussion

The value in this property represents the starting point for new line and curve segments. If the path is currently empty, this property contains the value [CGPointZero](../../coregraphics/cgpointzero.md).

### Related Documentation

- [isEmpty](isempty.md): A Boolean value that indicates whether the path has any valid elements.

### Constructing a path

- [move(to:)](move%28to_%29.md): Moves the path’s current point to the specified location.
- [addLine(to:)](addline%28to_%29.md): Appends a straight line to the path.
- [addArc(withCenter:radius:startAngle:endAngle:clockwise:)](addarc%28withcenter_radius_startangle_endangle_clockwise_%29.md): Appends an arc to the path.
- [addCurve(to:controlPoint1:controlPoint2:)](addcurve%28to_controlpoint1_controlpoint2_%29.md): Appends a cubic Bézier curve to the path.
- [addQuadCurve(to:controlPoint:)](addquadcurve%28to_controlpoint_%29.md): Appends a quadratic Bézier curve to the path.
- [close()](close%28%29.md): Closes the most recent subpath.
- [removeAllPoints()](removeallpoints%28%29.md): Removes all points from the path, effectively deleting all subpaths.
- [append(\_:)](append%28__%29.md): Appends the contents of the specified path object to the path.
- [cgPath](cgpath.md): The Core Graphics representation of the path.
