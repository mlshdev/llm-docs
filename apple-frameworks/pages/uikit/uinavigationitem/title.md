# title (Swift)

**Framework:** UIKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 2.0+ · iPadOS 2.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · tvOS · visionOS 1.0+

The navigation item’s title that displays in the navigation bar.

## Declaration

```swift
var title: String? { get set }
```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

The default value is `nil`.

When the navigation item is on the navigation item stack and is second from the top — in other words, its view controller manages the views that the user would navigate back to — the value in this property is used for the back button on the top-most navigation bar. If the value of this property is `nil`, the system uses the string “Back” as the text of the back button. In iOS 11 and later, the size and position of the title is determined by the [prefersLargeTitles](../uinavigationbar/preferslargetitles.md) property of the navigation bar and the [largeTitleDisplayMode](largetitledisplaymode-swift.property.md) property of the navigation item.

### Display content in a toolbar on Mac

For Mac apps built with Mac Catalyst, the system can display a navigation bar’s content in an [NSToolbar](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstoolbar). When the system displays a navigation bar’s content in a toolbar, `title` and [subtitle](subtitle.md) are only supported when you associate the navigation bar with the [UINavigationBar.NSToolbarSection.content](../uinavigationbar/nstoolbarsection/content.md) section of the toolbar. The system ignores values from all other sections. `NSToolbar` doesn’t support a navigation item’s [titleView](titleview.md), large titles, or attributed titles, regardless of section.

For more information about when the system displays a navigation bar’s content in a toolbar, see [Building with Mac Catalyst](../uinavigationbar.md#Building-with-Mac-Catalyst).

When present, `title` and `subtitle` take precedence over the window scene’s [title](../uiscene/title.md) and [subtitle](../uiscene/subtitle.md). To avoid displaying an orphaned scene subtitle, the system only uses the scene’s subtitle when the navigation item hasn’t set a title. These values appear in the standard locations [NSWindow](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nswindow) uses, rather than above the navigation item’s column.
