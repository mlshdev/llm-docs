# Adding tables to attributed strings in UIKit (Swift)

**Framework:** UIKit  
**Kind:** Article

Create and configure tables in attributed strings and display them in a text view.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

[NSTextTable](nstexttable.md) and its related classes let you embed tables of rows and columns directly into [NSAttributedString](../foundation/nsattributedstring.md) objects on all Apple platforms. [NSAttributedString](../foundation/nsattributedstring.md) stores a string together with per-character formatting attributes — such as fonts, colors, and paragraph styles — and is the primary text type for UIKit text views. You build a table from three objects:

- **[NSTextTable](nstexttable.md)** represents the table as a whole and defines the column count and layout algorithm.
- **[NSTextTableBlock](nstexttableblock.md)** represents a single cell and records the cell’s row, column, and span values. It belongs to a parent table.
- **[NSTextBlock](nstextblock.md)** is the base class, and it defines the visual properties (background color, border, padding, margin) that both tables and individual cells share.

You build a table by creating one [NSTextTable](nstexttable.md), then creating one [NSTextTableBlock](nstexttableblock.md) per cell and assigning each block to a paragraph in the attributed string using [textBlocks](nsparagraphstyle/textblocks.md). The text system reads the [textBlocks](nsparagraphstyle/textblocks.md) array of adjacent paragraphs to determine the table’s structure.

### Create the table and its cells

Start by creating the table and configuring its column count. The following code shows how to create a table with three equally sized columns and enable collapsed borders so adjacent cells share a single border line:

```swift
let table = NSTextTable()
table.numberOfColumns = 3
table.collapsesBorders = true
```

Then create a block for each cell, specifying its position and span within the table. The following helper function creates a cell at the specified row and column, sets its width to one-third of the available space, and applies a light gray background, a separator-colored 1-point border, and 4 points of padding on all edges:

```swift
func makeCell(row: Int, column: Int, in table: NSTextTable) -> NSTextTableBlock {
    let cell = NSTextTableBlock(
        table: table,
        startingRow: row, rowSpan: 1,
        startingColumn: column, columnSpan: 1
    )
    cell.setContentWidth(33, type: .percentage)
    cell.backgroundColor = UIColor.secondarySystemBackground
    cell.setBorderColor(.separator)
    cell.setWidth(1, type: .absolute, for: .border)
    cell.setWidth(4, type: .absolute, for: .padding)
    return cell
}
```

### Apply cells to paragraphs

Each cell maps to exactly one paragraph in the attributed string. Assign the cell block to that paragraph using `NSMutableParagraphStyle.textBlocks`. The following code builds a 2×3 table — two rows and three columns — by creating a cell block for each position and appending a styled paragraph for each cell to the attributed string:

```swift
let string = NSMutableAttributedString()

for row in 0..<2 {
    for column in 0..<3 {
        let cell = makeCell(row: row, column: column, in: table)

        let style = NSMutableParagraphStyle()
        style.textBlocks = [cell]

        let cellText = NSAttributedString(
            string: "Row \(row), Col \(column)\n",
            attributes: [.paragraphStyle: style]
        )
        string.append(cellText)
    }
}
```

The [textBlocks](nsparagraphstyle/textblocks.md) array is ordered from outermost to innermost block. For a table without nested blocks, each cell paragraph has a single-element array.

### Configure per-edge widths and colors

You can set widths and border colors independently for each edge using [setWidth(\_:type:for:rectEdge:)](nstextblock/setwidth%28__type_for_rectedge_%29.md) and [setBorderColor(\_:rectEdge:)](nstextblock/setbordercolor%28__rectedge_%29.md). For example, the following code applies a 2-point blue border to the bottom edge of a cell, leaving the other edges unchanged:

```swift
cell.setWidth(2, type: .absolute, for: .border, rectEdge: .maxYEdge)
cell.setBorderColor(.systemBlue, rectEdge: .maxYEdge)
```

Use the [CGRectEdge](../corefoundation/cgrectedge.md) values [CGRectEdge.minXEdge](../corefoundation/cgrectedge/minxedge.md) (leading), [CGRectEdge.maxXEdge](../corefoundation/cgrectedge/maxxedge.md) (trailing), [CGRectEdge.minYEdge](../corefoundation/cgrectedge/minyedge.md) (top), and [CGRectEdge.maxYEdge](../corefoundation/cgrectedge/maxyedge.md) (bottom).

To support iOS 26 and earlier, use [setWidth(\_:type:for:)](nstextblock/setwidth%28__type_for_%29.md) and [setBorderColor(\_:)](nstextblock/setbordercolor%28__%29.md) to apply a uniform width or color to all edges.

<a id="Choose-a-layout-algorithm"></a>

### Choose a layout algorithm

By default, [NSTextTable.LayoutAlgorithm.automatic](nstexttable/layoutalgorithm-swift.enum/automatic.md) distributes width based on content. Use [NSTextTable.LayoutAlgorithm.automatic](nstexttable/layoutalgorithm-swift.enum/automatic.md) when you want your column widths to adapt to the content — for example, a label-value table where short labels sit beside values that vary in length.

If you want consistent, predictable column widths regardless of content length, use [NSTextTable.LayoutAlgorithm.fixed](nstexttable/layoutalgorithm-swift.enum/fixed.md), which distributes width based on the explicit [contentWidth](nstextblock/contentwidth.md) values set on the first row of cells. For example, if your app displays a data grid where each column always occupies one-third of the available width, set each first-row cell to 33 percent and switch to fixed layout:

```swift
table.layoutAlgorithm = .fixed
```

<a id="Display-the-result"></a>

### Display the result

Assign the attributed string to a [UITextView](uitextview.md) to render the table. The text system reads the paragraph style information embedded in the string to interpret the table structure automatically, so no extra configuration of the view is required:

```swift
textView.attributedText = string
```
