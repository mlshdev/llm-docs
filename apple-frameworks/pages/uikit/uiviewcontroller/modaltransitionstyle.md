## Discussion

This property determines how the view controller’s is animated onscreen when it is presented using the [present(\_:animated:completion:)](present%28__animated_completion_%29.md) method. To change the transition type, you must set this property before presenting the view controller. The default value for this property is [UIModalTransitionStyle.coverVertical](../uimodaltransitionstyle/coververtical.md).

For a list of possible transition styles, and their compatibility with the available presentation styles, see the [UIModalTransitionStyle](../uimodaltransitionstyle.md) constant descriptions.
