# unregisterForPreviewing(withContext:) (Swift)

**Framework:** UIKit  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 9.0+ (deprecated in 13.0) · iPadOS 9.0+ (deprecated in 13.0) · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ (deprecated in 13.1) · tvOS 9.0+ (deprecated in 13.0)

Unregisters a previously registered view controller identified by its context object.

> Use [UIContextMenuInteraction](../uicontextmenuinteraction.md) instead.

## Declaration

```swift
func unregisterForPreviewing(withContext previewing: any UIViewControllerPreviewing)
```

## Parameters

- `previewing`: The context object that was returned when you registered the view controller by calling the [registerForPreviewing(with:sourceView:)](registerforpreviewing%28with_sourceview_%29.md) method.

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

The system calls this method automatically when a 3D Touch-registered view controller is deallocated.

In some circumstances, you must explicitly call this method. This is the case if a registered view controller’s view hierarchy changes state, or if presenting a preview is otherwise no longer possible. In such cases, call this method.
