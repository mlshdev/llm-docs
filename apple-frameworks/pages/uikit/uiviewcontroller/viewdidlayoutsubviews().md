# viewDidLayoutSubviews() (Swift)

**Framework:** UIKit  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 5.0+ · iPadOS 5.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · tvOS · visionOS 1.0+

Notifies the view controller when its view finishes laying out its subviews.

## Declaration

```swift
func viewDidLayoutSubviews()
```

## Mentioned In

## Discussion

When the bounds change for a view controller’s view, the view adjusts the positions of its subviews and then the system calls this method. However, this method being called *does not* indicate that the individual layouts of the view’s subviews have been adjusted. Each subview is responsible for adjusting its own layout.

Your view controller can override this method to make changes after the view lays out its subviews. The default implementation of this method does nothing.

In iOS 18 and later, UIKit supports automatic trait tracking inside this method for traits from this view controller’s `traitCollection` and the `traitCollection` of its [view](view.md). For more information, see [Automatic trait tracking](../automatic-trait-tracking.md).

This method supports automatic observation tracking. For more information, see [Updating views automatically with observation tracking in UIKit](../updating-views-automatically-with-observation-tracking-in-uikit.md).
