# attemptRotationToDeviceOrientation() (Swift)

**Framework:** UIKit  
**Kind:** Type Method  
**Availability:** iOS 5.0+ (deprecated in 16.0) · iPadOS 5.0+ (deprecated in 16.0) · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ (deprecated in 16.0) · visionOS 1.0+ (deprecated in 1.0)

Attempts to rotate all windows to the orientation of the device.

> Use [setNeedsUpdateOfSupportedInterfaceOrientations()](setneedsupdateofsupportedinterfaceorientations%28%29.md) instead.

## Declaration

```swift
class func attemptRotationToDeviceOrientation()
```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

Some view controllers may want to use app-specific conditions to determine what interface orientations are supported. If your view controller does this, when those conditions change, your app should call this class method. The system immediately attempts to rotate to the new orientation.
