## Overview

A cell accessory is a visual element that you can add to a list cell ([UICollectionViewListCell](uicollectionviewlistcell.md)). You use a cell accessory as a visual indicator or to let a user perform a cell-specific action like selecting, reordering, or deleting the cell. A cell accessory appears either on the leading or the trailing edge of a cell, outside of the cell’s content view.

UIKit defines a set of standard system cell accessories. System accessories have default system-defined appearances, but you can make some customizations to them, like setting a custom tint color. You can’t customize the placement of system accessories. If you want additional customization, you can create a custom accessory with [customView(configuration:)](uicellaccessory-swift.struct/customview%28configuration_%29.md).

You add accessories to a list cell by setting its [accessories](uicollectionviewlistcell/accessories-88j0f.md) array.

```swift
cell.accessories = [ 
    .checkmark(), 
    .disclosureIndicator(options: .init(tintColor: .systemGray)), 
    .delete(),
    .reorder() 
]
```

> **Important**

>  The system throws an exception if you include more than one instance of any system accessory. You can include multiple custom accessories.
