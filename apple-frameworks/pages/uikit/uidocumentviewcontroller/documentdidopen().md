# documentDidOpen() (Swift)

**Framework:** UIKit  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 17.0+ · iPadOS 17.0+ · Mac Catalyst 17.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

Provides an opportunity to configure the view after the system loads the controller’s document into memory.

## Declaration

```swift
func documentDidOpen()
```

## Mentioned In

- [Customizing a document-based app’s launch experience](../customizing-a-document-based-app-s-launch-experience.md)

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

The system calls this method after the document view controller opens its document, or when an object assigns an already opened document to the document view controller’s `document` property. Override this method to customize the views that present your document in the view:

```swift
override func documentDidOpen() {
    configureViewForCurrentDocument()
}
```

Configure the view in its own method and call that method in both `documentDidOpen()` and [viewDidLoad()](../uiviewcontroller/viewdidload%28%29.md). There is no timing guarantee between when the system calls `documentDidOpen` and when it loads the view controller’s view.

### Managing the document view

- [document](document.md): The document that the controller presents or edits.
- [openDocument(completionHandler:)](opendocument%28completionhandler_%29.md): Opens a document in a document view controller from outside the document view controller.
