# UIVideoEditorController (Swift)

**Framework:** UIKit  
**Kind:** Class  
**Availability:** iOS 3.1+ · iPadOS 3.1+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · visionOS 1.0+

A view controller that manages the system interface for trimming video frames and encoding a previously recorded movie.

## Declaration

```swift
@MainActor class UIVideoEditorController
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

A video editor manages user interactions and provides the filesystem path of the edited movie to your delegate object (see [UIVideoEditorControllerDelegate](uivideoeditorcontrollerdelegate.md)). The features of the [UIVideoEditorController](uivideoeditorcontroller.md) class are available only on devices that support video recording. Use a video editor when your intent is to provide an interface for movie editing. While the [UIImagePickerController](uiimagepickercontroller.md) class also lets a user trim movies, its primary roles are choosing saved pictures and movies, and capturing new pictures and movies.

> **Important**

>  The `UIVideoEditorController` class supports portrait mode only. This class is intended to be used as-is and doesn’t support subclassing. The view hierarchy for this class is private; don’t modify the view hierarchy. This class doesn’t support modifications to its appearance by use of overlay views.

## Topics

### Managing changes to the video

- [delegate](uivideoeditorcontroller/delegate.md): The video editor’s delegate object.
- [UIVideoEditorControllerDelegate](uivideoeditorcontrollerdelegate.md): A set of methods that your delegate object must implement to respond to the video editor.

### Determining editing availability

- [canEditVideo(atPath:)](uivideoeditorcontroller/caneditvideo%28atpath_%29.md): Returns a Boolean value indicating whether a video file can be edited.

### Configuring the editor

- [videoMaximumDuration](uivideoeditorcontroller/videomaximumduration.md): The maximum duration, in seconds, permitted for trimmed movies saved by the video editor.
- [videoPath](uivideoeditorcontroller/videopath.md): The filesystem path to the movie to be loaded by the video editor.
- [videoQuality](uivideoeditorcontroller/videoquality.md): The video quality to use when saving a trimmed movie.
