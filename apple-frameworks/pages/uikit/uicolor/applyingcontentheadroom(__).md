# applyingContentHeadroom(\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** UIKit  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 26.0+ · iPadOS 26.0+ · Mac Catalyst 26.0+ · tvOS 26.0+ · visionOS 26.0+ · watchOS 26.0+

Reinterpret the color by applying a new `contentHeadroom` without changing the color components. Changing the `contentHeadroom` redefines the color relative to a different peak white, changing its behavior under tone mapping and the result of calling `standardDynamicRangeColor`. The new color will have a `contentHeadroom` \>= 1.0.

## Declaration

```swift
func applyingContentHeadroom(_ contentHeadroom: CGFloat) -> UIColor
```

### Working with high dynamic range (HDR) colors

- [standardDynamicRange](standarddynamicrange.md): In some cases it is useful to recover the color that was base SDR color that was exposed to generate the given HDR color. If a color’s `linearExposure` is \>1, then this will return the base SDR color.
