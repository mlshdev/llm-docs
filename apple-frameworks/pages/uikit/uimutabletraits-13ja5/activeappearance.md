## Discussion

`activeAppearance` describes whether a scene is frontmost; it doesn’t describe a scene’s life-cycle state. A scene that isn’t frontmost can remain in the [UIScene.ActivationState.foregroundActive](../uiscene/activationstate-swift.enum/foregroundactive.md) activation state as long as it can still receive user interaction. Its activation state changes to [UIScene.ActivationState.foregroundInactive](../uiscene/activationstate-swift.enum/foregroundinactive.md) only when a system interruption takes over interaction. This can happen because of Control Center, an alert, Siri, App Switcher, or another app’s window covering it in windowed apps. Use [UIScene.ActivationState](../uiscene/activationstate-swift.enum.md) to decide when to save view state, and use `activeAppearance` to detect when a scene is no longer frontmost.

Because `activeAppearance` belongs to a scene’s trait collection, each scene has its own value, even in apps that support multiple scenes. To detect when a scene becomes frontmost, register for changes to this trait by calling [registerForTraitChanges(\_:handler:)](../uitraitchangeobservable-67e94/registerfortraitchanges%28__handler_%29.md) on the window scene, or on any view or view controller in its hierarchy.

In Mac apps built with Mac Catalyst, Stage Manager on iPad, and a windowed app on iPad, the value is `.active` when the window is focused (the key window) and `.inactive` when it isn’t. A window that another app’s window covers keeps an `.active` appearance as long as it remains the focused window.

In iOS and in a full-screen app on iPad, the value reflects whether the app itself is in the foreground (`.active`) or not (`.inactive`).
