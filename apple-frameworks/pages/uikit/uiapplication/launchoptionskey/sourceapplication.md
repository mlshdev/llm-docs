**Kind:** Type Property  
**Availability:** iOS 3.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · iPadOS 3.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ (deprecated in 26.0) · tvOS 9.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · visionOS 1.0+ (deprecated in 26.0)

## Discussion

The value of this key is an [NSString](../../../foundation/nsstring.md) object containing the bundle ID of the app that made the request. If the request originated from another app belonging to your team, UIKit sets the value of this key to the ID of that app. If the team identifier of the originating app is different than the team identifier of the current app, the value of the key is `nil`.

This key is also used to access the same value in the `userInfo` dictionary of the notification named  [didFinishLaunchingNotification](../didfinishlaunchingnotification.md).
