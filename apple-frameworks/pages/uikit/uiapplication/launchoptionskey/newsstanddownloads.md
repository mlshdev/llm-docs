# newsstandDownloads (Swift)

**Framework:** UIKit  
**Kind:** Type Property  
**Availability:** iOS 5.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · iPadOS 5.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ (deprecated in 26.0) · visionOS 1.0+ (deprecated in 26.0)

A key indicating that the app was launched to process newly downloaded Newsstand assets.

> This dictionary key is no longer used.

## Declaration

```swift
static let newsstandDownloads: UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey
```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

The value of this key is an array of string identifiers that identify the `NKAssetDownload` objects corresponding to the assets. Although you can use the identifiers for cross-checking purposes, you should obtain the definitive array of `NKAssetDownload` objects (representing asset downloads in progress or in error) through the `downloadingAssets` property of the `NKLibrary` object representing the Newsstand app’s library.
