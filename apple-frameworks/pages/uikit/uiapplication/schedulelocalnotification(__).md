# scheduleLocalNotification(\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** UIKit  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 4.0+ (deprecated in 10.0) · iPadOS 4.0+ (deprecated in 10.0) · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ (deprecated in 13.1)

Schedules a local notification for delivery at its encapsulated date and time.

> Use the [UNUserNotificationCenter](../../usernotifications/unusernotificationcenter.md) class to schedule local notifications instead.

## Declaration

```swift
func scheduleLocalNotification(_ notification: UILocalNotification)
```

## Parameters

- `notification`: The local notification object that you want to schedule. This object contains information about when to deliver the notification and what to do when that date occurs. The system keeps a copy of this object so you may release the object once it is scheduled.

## Discussion

Prior to scheduling any local notifications, you must call the [registerUserNotificationSettings(\_:)](registerusernotificationsettings%28__%29.md) method to let the system know what types of alerts, if any, you plan to display to the user.
