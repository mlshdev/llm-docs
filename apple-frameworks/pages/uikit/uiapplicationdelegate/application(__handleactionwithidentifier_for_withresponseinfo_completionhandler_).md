# application(\_:handleActionWithIdentifier:for:withResponseInfo:completionHandler:) (Swift)

**Framework:** UIKit  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 9.0+ (deprecated in 10.0) · iPadOS 9.0+ (deprecated in 10.0) · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ (deprecated in 13.1)

Called when your app has been activated by the user selecting an action from a local notification.

> Use [userNotificationCenter(\_:didReceive:withCompletionHandler:)](../../usernotifications/unusernotificationcenterdelegate/usernotificationcenter%28__didreceive_withcompletionhandler_%29.md) instead.

## Declaration

```swift
optional func application(_ application: UIApplication, handleActionWithIdentifier identifier: String?, for notification: UILocalNotification, withResponseInfo responseInfo: [AnyHashable : Any], completionHandler: @escaping () -> Void)
```

```swift
optional func application(_ application: UIApplication, handleActionWithIdentifier identifier: String?, for notification: UILocalNotification, withResponseInfo responseInfo: [AnyHashable : Any]) async
```

## Parameters

- `application`: The app object that was activated for the user-selected action.
- `identifier`: The identifier for the custom action.
- `notification`: The local notification object that was triggered.
- `responseInfo`: The data dictionary sent by the action.
- `completionHandler`: A block that you must call when you are finished performing the action.

## Discussion

A `nil` value in the `identifier` parameter indicates the default action.
