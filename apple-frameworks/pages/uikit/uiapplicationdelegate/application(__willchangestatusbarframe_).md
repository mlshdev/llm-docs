## Discussion

The app calls this method when it receives a [setStatusBarOrientation(\_:animated:)](../uiapplication/setstatusbarorientation%28__animated_%29.md) message and is about to change the interface orientation.

After calling this method, the app also posts a [willChangeStatusBarFrameNotification](../uiapplication/willchangestatusbarframenotification.md) notification to give interested objects a chance to respond to the change.
