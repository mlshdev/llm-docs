# containerViewWillLayoutSubviews() (Swift)

**Framework:** UIKit  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ · iPadOS 8.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · tvOS · visionOS 1.0+

Notifies the presentation controller that layout is about to begin on the views of the container view.

```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

UIKit calls this method before adjusting the layout of the views in the container view. Use this method and the [containerViewDidLayoutSubviews()](containerviewdidlayoutsubviews%28%29.md) method to update any custom views managed by your presentation controller.

In iOS 18 and later, UIKit supports automatic trait tracking inside this method for traits from this presentation controller’s `traitCollection` and the `traitCollection` of its [containerView](containerview.md). For more information, see [Automatic trait tracking](../automatic-trait-tracking.md).

This method supports automatic observation tracking. For more information, see [Updating views automatically with observation tracking in UIKit](../updating-views-automatically-with-observation-tracking-in-uikit.md).
