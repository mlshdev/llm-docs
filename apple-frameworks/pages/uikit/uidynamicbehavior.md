# UIDynamicBehavior (Swift)

**Framework:** UIKit  
**Kind:** Class  
**Availability:** iOS 7.0+ · iPadOS 7.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · tvOS · visionOS 1.0+

An object that confers a behavioral configuration on one or more dynamic items, for their participation in 2D animation.

## Declaration

```swift
@MainActor class UIDynamicBehavior
```

## Overview

A *dynamic item* is any iOS or custom object that conforms to the [UIDynamicItem](uidynamicitem.md) protocol. The [UIView](uiview.md) and [UICollectionViewLayoutAttributes](uicollectionviewlayoutattributes.md) classes implement this protocol starting in iOS 7.0. You can implement this protocol to use a dynamic animator with custom objects for such purposes as reacting to rotation or position changes computed by an animator—an instance of the [UIDynamicAnimator](uidynamicanimator.md) class.

This parent class, [UIDynamicBehavior](uidynamicbehavior.md), is inherited by the primitive dynamic behavior classes [UIAttachmentBehavior](uiattachmentbehavior.md), [UICollisionBehavior](uicollisionbehavior.md), [UIGravityBehavior](uigravitybehavior.md), [UIDynamicItemBehavior](uidynamicitembehavior.md), [UIPushBehavior](uipushbehavior.md), and [UISnapBehavior](uisnapbehavior.md).

You can subclass [UIDynamicBehavior](uidynamicbehavior.md). By using the [addChildBehavior(\_:)](uidynamicbehavior/addchildbehavior%28__%29.md) method in an instance of this class or in a custom subclass, you can create composite behaviors of your own design.

When you subclass [UIDynamicBehavior](uidynamicbehavior.md), you typically need to provide one or more initializers, along with other housekeeping methods such as those implemented in the iOS primitive dynamic behaviors.

To perform per-step logic in a dynamic animation, provide a block object using the [action](uidynamicbehavior/action.md) property.

To access the dynamic animator that a dynamic behavior is associated with, use the [dynamicAnimator](uidynamicbehavior/dynamicanimator.md) property. To respond to a dynamic behavior being added to or removed from a dynamic animator, implement the [willMove(to:)](uidynamicbehavior/willmove%28to_%29.md) method.

## Topics

### Configuring a dynamic behavior

- [action](uidynamicbehavior/action.md): The block you want to execute during dynamic animation.
- [addChildBehavior(\_:)](uidynamicbehavior/addchildbehavior%28__%29.md): Adds a dynamic behavior, as a child, to a custom dynamic behavior.
- [childBehaviors](uidynamicbehavior/childbehaviors.md): Returns the array of dynamic behaviors that are children of a custom dynamic behavior.
- [removeChildBehavior(\_:)](uidynamicbehavior/removechildbehavior%28__%29.md): Removes a child dynamic behavior from a custom dynamic behavior.

### Responding to changes in the behavior tree

- [dynamicAnimator](uidynamicbehavior/dynamicanimator.md): The dynamic animator that the dynamic behavior is associated with.
- [willMove(to:)](uidynamicbehavior/willmove%28to_%29.md): Called when the dynamic behavior is added to, or removed from, a dynamic animator.

### Behaviors

- [UIAttachmentBehavior](uiattachmentbehavior.md): A relationship between two dynamic items, or between a dynamic item and an anchor point.
- [UICollisionBehavior](uicollisionbehavior.md): An object that confers to a specified array of dynamic items the ability to engage in collisions with each other and with the behavior’s specified boundaries.
- [UIFieldBehavior](uifieldbehavior.md): An object that applies field-based physics to dynamic items.
- [UIGravityBehavior](uigravitybehavior.md): An object that applies a gravity-like force to all of its associated dynamic items.
- [UIPushBehavior](uipushbehavior.md): A behavior that applies a continuous or instantaneous force to one or more dynamic items, causing those items to change position accordingly.
- [UISnapBehavior](uisnapbehavior.md): A spring-like behavior whose initial motion is damped over time so that the object settles at a specific point.
