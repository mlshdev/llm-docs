# NSTextViewportRenderingSurfaceKey (Swift)

**Framework:** UIKit  
**Kind:** Protocol  
**Availability:** iOS 18.0+ · iPadOS 18.0+ · Mac Catalyst 18.0+ · tvOS 18.0+ · visionOS 2.0+ · watchOS 11.0+

A protocol that lets you use an object to identify a rendering surface when storing or retrieving it.

## Declaration

```swift
protocol NSTextViewportRenderingSurfaceKey : NSObjectProtocol
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

When TextKit lays out text in a viewport, it can ask your delegate to store and retrieve rendering surfaces across layout passes. Objects that conform to `NSTextViewportRenderingSurfaceKey` act as the identifier for each surface — TextKit passes them to your delegate when it needs to store or look one up.

Two types conform to this protocol by default:

- **`NSTextLayoutFragment`** — Use a layout fragment as a key to cache a rendering surface per fragment. This is the most common approach.
- **`NSString`** — Use a string as a key when you want to associate a rendering surface with a name rather than a fragment.

### Layout

- [Using TextKit 2 to interact with text](using-textkit-2-to-interact-with-text.md): Interact with text by managing text selection and inserting custom text elements.
- [Display text with a custom layout](display-text-with-a-custom-layout.md): Lay out text in a custom-shaped container and apply glyph substitutions.
- [Managing viewport layout and attachment reuse in text views](managing-viewport-layout-and-attachment-reuse-in-a-text-view-subclass.md): Customize layout and preserve attachment views in your text view subclass.
- [NSTextLayoutManager](nstextlayoutmanager.md): The primary class that you use to manage text layout and presentation for custom text displays.
- [NSTextContainer](nstextcontainer.md): A region where text layout occurs.
- [NSTextLayoutFragment](nstextlayoutfragment.md): A class that represents the layout fragment typically corresponding to a rendering surface, such as a layer or view subclass.
- [NSTextLineFragment](nstextlinefragment.md): A class that represents a line fragment as a single textual layout and rendering unit inside a text layout fragment.
- [NSTextViewportLayoutController](nstextviewportlayoutcontroller.md): Manages the layout process inside the viewport interacting with its delegate.
- [NSTextViewportRenderingSurface](nstextviewportrenderingsurface.md): A protocol that identifies a view or layer as a drawable element for a text layout fragment.
- [NSTextLayoutOrientationProvider](nstextlayoutorientationprovider.md): A set of methods that define the orientation of text for an object.
