## Discussion

The following image shows an example of a horizontal stack view that uses the [UIStackView.Distribution.fillProportionally](fillproportionally.md) distribution.

### Constants

- [UIStackView.Distribution.fill](fill.md): A layout where the stack view resizes its arranged views so that they fill the available space along the stack view’s axis.
- [UIStackView.Distribution.fillEqually](fillequally.md): A layout where the stack view resizes all arranged views to the same size, filling the available space along the stack view’s axis.
- [UIStackView.Distribution.equalSpacing](equalspacing.md): A layout where the stack view maintains equal spacing between adjacent views while preserving their intrinsic content size.
- [UIStackView.Distribution.equalCentering](equalcentering.md): A layout that attempts to position the arranged views with equal center-to-center spacing along the stack view’s axis, while maintaining the spacing property’s distance between views.
