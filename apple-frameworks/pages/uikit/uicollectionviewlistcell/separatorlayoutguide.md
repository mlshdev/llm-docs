# separatorLayoutGuide (Swift)

**Framework:** UIKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 14.0+ · iPadOS 14.0+ · Mac Catalyst 14.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

A guide for laying out separators in relation to the primary content in the cell.

## Declaration

var separatorLayoutGuide: UILayoutGuide { get }
```

## Discussion

This property only takes effect in a layout section that supports separators, like a section that you create using [list(using:layoutEnvironment:)](../nscollectionlayoutsection/list%28using_layoutenvironment_%29.md).

The separator layout guide represents the frame of the separator, which the system uses to determine where to draw the separator at the bottom of the cell.

By default, when you apply a system-provided content configuration to a list cell, the separator automatically aligns to the primary text in the content view. For custom subviews in the cell, you need to add a constraint to this layout guide that connects it to the leading edge of the cell’s primary content.

The leading edge of the separator layout guide is constrained to the leading edge of the primary content, the beginning of the word “Favorites.”](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.uikit/media-3680734@2x.png)

To align the separators to your content, add constraints to the leading or trailing anchors of this layout guide.
