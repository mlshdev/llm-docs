# windowScene(\_:userDidAcceptCloudKitShareWith:) (Swift)

**Framework:** UIKit  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · tvOS 13.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

Tells the delegate that the window scene now has access to shared information in CloudKit.

## Declaration

```swift
optional func windowScene(_ windowScene: UIWindowScene, userDidAcceptCloudKitShareWith cloudKitShareMetadata: CKShareMetadata)
```

## Parameters

- `windowScene`: The window scene object receiving the metadata.
- `cloudKitShareMetadata`: Information about the CloudKit data that is now available to the app. Use this object to retrieve information about the [CKShare](../../cloudkit/ckshare.md) object and the associated records.

## Discussion

Use this method to respond to a CloudKit Sharing invitation. In your implementation, accept the share by scheduling a [CKAcceptSharesOperation](../../cloudkit/ckacceptsharesoperation.md) object that contains the metadata object in the `cloudKitShareMetadata` parameter. After your operation object finishes successfully, you can begin fetching records and incorporating the resulting data into your app. Alternatively, if your app uses Core Data and [NSPersistentCloudKitContainer](../../coredata/nspersistentcloudkitcontainer.md), accept the share by calling the container’s [acceptShareInvitationsFromMetadata:intoPersistentStore:completion:](../../coredata/nspersistentcloudkitcontainer/acceptshareinvitationsfrommetadata_intopersistentstore_completion_.md) method.

> **Note**

>  To use this method in a SwiftUI app, you must first add scene and application delegates to your project and configure your app to use them. For more information, see [Accepting Share Invitations in a SwiftUI App](../../coredata/accepting-share-invitations-in-a-swiftui-app.md).

The system calls this method only when your app is running and has an existing scene. If your app isn’t running, the system includes the share metadata in the [UIScene.ConnectionOptions](../uiscene/connectionoptions.md) object it passes to the [init(session:connectionOptions:)](../uiscene/init%28session_connectionoptions_%29.md) method when it creates your app’s first scene.
