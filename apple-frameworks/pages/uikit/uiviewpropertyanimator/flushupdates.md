# flushUpdates (Swift)

**Framework:** UIKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 26.0+ · iPadOS 26.0+ · Mac Catalyst 26.0+ · tvOS 26.0+ · visionOS 26.0+

Flush all pending updates (including traits, properties, and layout) whenever the animation context changes. This includes flushing updates:

## Declaration

```swift
var flushUpdates: Bool { get set }
```

<a id="discussion"></a>

## Discussion

- Before entering an animation scope, for invalidations that happened previously without animation.
- Before entering a nested animation scope, for invalidations that happened in the outer animation scope.
- Before exiting any animation scope, for invalidations that happened in that animation scope.
- Before disabling animations, for invalidations that happened in the animation scope with animations enabled.
- Before re-enabling animations, for invalidations that happened in the scope with animations disabled. This behavior implicitly applies to any nested animation scopes, even if they don’t explicitly specify this.
