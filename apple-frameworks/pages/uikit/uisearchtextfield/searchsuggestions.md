## Discussion

Provide search suggestions to help people complete their query quickly. Update the suggestions as a person types by registering for the [textDidChangeNotification](../uitextfield/textdidchangenotification.md) notification and implementing [textFieldDidEndEditing(\_:reason:)](../uitextfielddelegate/textfielddidendediting%28__reason_%29.md).

The suggestions appear in a menu under the search field. When you assign new suggestions to this property, the suggestions onscreen refresh automatically. When a person chooses a suggestion, the system sets this property to `nil` and dismisses the search suggestions menu. Implement [searchTextField(\_:didSelect:)](../uisearchtextfielddelegate/searchtextfield%28__didselect_%29.md) in your delegate to execute any necessary updates when a person chooses a suggestion.

If the search suggestions menu dismisses for other reasons, such as a person tapping outside the search bar, [searchSuggestions](searchsuggestions.md) doesn’t reset to `nil` immediately. The system sets [searchSuggestions](searchsuggestions.md) to `nil` only when a person interacts with search directly — for example, by typing in the search field, canceling search, or changing the search scope using the search bar’s scope bar. To dismiss the menu manually, set this property to `nil` or `[]`.

> **Important**

>  UIKit allows setting this property directly on an instance of [UISearchTextField](../uisearchtextfield.md) only when the search field isn’t associated with a [UISearchController](../uisearchcontroller.md). If the search field is associated with a search controller, the system raises an [invalidArgumentException](../../foundation/nsexceptionname/invalidargumentexception.md) to use the [searchSuggestions](../uisearchcontroller/searchsuggestions.md) property on [UISearchController](../uisearchcontroller.md) instead.
