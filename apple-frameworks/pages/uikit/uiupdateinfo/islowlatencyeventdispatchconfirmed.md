# isLowLatencyEventDispatchConfirmed (Swift)

**Framework:** UIKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 18.0+ · iPadOS 18.0+ · Mac Catalyst 18.0+ · tvOS 18.0+ · visionOS 2.0+

A Boolean value that indicates whether the system runs low-latency phases for the UI update.

## Declaration

```swift
var isLowLatencyEventDispatchConfirmed: Bool { get }
```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

The value of this property is [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true) when the system runs low-latency event dispatch during the UI update. Use this information to determine whether to avoid doing the same work more than once. For example, when considering whether to render a pencil-drawing stroke in [afterEventDispatch](../uiupdateactionphase/aftereventdispatch.md), if this property is `true`, but [isPerformingLowLatencyPhases](isperforminglowlatencyphases.md) is `false`, you might consider waiting until after low-latency event dispatch to render the stroke.

This value can change from `false` to `true` during the UI update, but not from `true` to `false`.

> **Important**

>  Checking the value of this property can cause the system to commit to low-latency event dispatch unnecessarily. Check this property only when you have an intention to act on its value.
