# UILexicon (Swift)

**Framework:** UIKit  
**Kind:** Class  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ · iPadOS 8.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · visionOS 1.0+

A read-only array of term pairs, each in a lexicon entry object, for a custom keyboard.

## Declaration

```swift
@MainActor class UILexicon
```

## Mentioned In

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

To obtain the lexicon, call the [requestSupplementaryLexicon(completion:)](uiinputviewcontroller/requestsupplementarylexicon%28completion_%29.md) method of the [UIInputViewController](uiinputviewcontroller.md) class. This method can be called only from a custom keyboard app extension. A lexicon contains words from various sources, including:

- Unpaired first names and last names from the user’s Address Book database
- Text shortcuts defined in the Settings \> General \> Keyboard \> Shortcuts list
- A common words dictionary

Apple intends for you to consider the words in a lexicon object as supplementary to an autocorrection/suggestion lexicon of your own design. For information on custom keyboards, see [Custom Keyboard](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/CustomKeyboard.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014214-CH16) in [App Extension Programming Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014214).
