# animationSettings

**Framework:** QuickTime File Format  
**Kind:** Data field

A set of 32-bit flags that encode information about the animation settings of the object.

## Overview

The `animationSettings` field of the object sample atom is a long integer that specifies a set of animation settings for an object node. Animation settings specify characteristics of the movie while it is playing. Use these constants to specify animation settings:

```c
enum QTVRAnimationSettings {
    kQTVRObjectAnimateViewFramesOn              = (1 << 0),
    kQTVRObjectPalindromeViewFramesOn           = (1 << 1),
    kQTVRObjectStartFirstViewFrameOn            = (1 << 2),
    kQTVRObjectAnimateViewsOn                   = (1 << 3),
    kQTVRObjectPalindromeViewsOn                = (1 << 4),
    kQTVRObjectSyncViewToFrameRate              = (1 << 5),
    kQTVRObjectDontLoopViewFramesOn             = (1 << 6),
    kQTVRObjectPlayEveryViewFrameOn             = (1 << 7)
};
```

**Constant Descriptions**

- **`kQTVRObjectAnimateViewFramesOn`**: The animation setting to play all frames in the current view state.
- **`kQTVRObjectPalindromeViewFramesOn`**: The animation setting to play a back-and-forth animation of the frames of the current view state.
- **`kQTVRObjectStartFirstViewFrameOn`**: The animation setting to play the frame animation starting with the first frame in the view (that is, at the view start time).
- **`kQTVRObjectAnimateViewsOn`**: The animation setting to play all views of the current object in the default row of views.
- **`kQTVRObjectPalindromeViewsOn`**: The animation setting to play a back-and-forth animation of all views of the current object in the default row of views.
- **`kQTVRObjectSyncViewToFrameRate`**: The animation setting to synchronize the view animation to the frame animation and use the same options as for frame animation.
- **`kQTVRObjectDontLoopViewFramesOn`**: The animation setting to stop playing the frame animation in the current view at the end.
- **`kQTVRObjectPlayEveryViewFrameOn`**: The animation setting to play every view frame regardless of play rate. The play rate is used to adjust the duration in which a frame appears but no frames are skipped so the rate is not exact.
