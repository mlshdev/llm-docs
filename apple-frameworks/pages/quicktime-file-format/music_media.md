## Overview

Music media is used to store note-based audio data, such as MIDI data, in QuickTime movies. It has a media type of `'musi'`.

## Music sample description

The music sample description uses the standard sample description header, as described in  [Sample description atom](sample_description_atom.md).

The data format field in the sample description is always set to `'musi'`. The music media handler adds an additional 32-bit integer field to the sample description containing flags. Currently no flags are defined, and this field should be set to `0`.

Following the flags field, there may be appended data in the QuickTime music format. This data consists of part-to-instrument mappings in the form of General events containing note requests. One note request event should be present for each part that will be used in the sample data.

## Music Sample Data

The sample data for music samples consists entirely of data in the QuickTime music format. Typically, up to 30 seconds of notes are grouped into a single sample.
