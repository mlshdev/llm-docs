## Overview

Whereas the QuickTime VR media sample is simply the node information itself, all sample descriptions are required by QuickTime to have a certain structure for the first several bytes. The structure for the QuickTime VR sample description is as follows:

```c
typedef struct QTVRSampleDescription {
    UInt32                              size;
    UInt32                              type;
    UInt32                              reserved1;
    UInt16                              reserved2;
    UInt16                              dataRefIndex;
    UInt32                              data;
} QTVRSampleDescription, *QTVRSampleDescriptionPtr, **QTVRSampleDescriptionHandle;
```
