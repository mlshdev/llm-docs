# Track input map atoms

**Framework:** QuickTime File Format  
**Kind:** API Collection

Atoms that define how data being sent to this track from its nonprimary sources is to be interpreted.

## Overview

Track input map atoms define how data being sent to this track from its nonprimary sources is to be interpreted. Track references of type `'ssrc'` define a track’s secondary data sources. These sources provide additional data that is to be used when processing the track. Track input map atoms have an atom type value of `'imap'`.
