# Bit rate atom ('btrt')

**Framework:** QuickTime File Format  
**Kind:** Atom

An atom that signals the bit rate information of a stream.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

The optional bit rate atom may be present at the end of any timed metadata sample description to signal the bit rate information of a stream. The bit rate information can be used for buffer configuration.

The layout of a bit rate atom is as follows:

| Data field | Bytes |
| --- | --- |
| [Size](bit_rate_atom/size.md) | 4 |
| [Type](bit_rate_atom/type.md) = `'btrt'` | 4 |
| [Buffer size](bit_rate_atom/buffer_size.md) | 4 |
| [Max bit rate](bit_rate_atom/max_bit_rate.md) | 4 |
| [Average bit rate](bit_rate_atom/average_bit_rate.md) | 4 |

## Topics

### Data fields

- [Size](bit_rate_atom/size.md): A 32-bit unsigned integer that indicates the size in bytes of the atom structure.
- [Type](bit_rate_atom/type.md): A 32-bit unsigned integer value.
- [Buffer size](bit_rate_atom/buffer_size.md): A 32-bit unsigned integer that indicates the suggested size of the associated data buffer.
- [Max bit rate](bit_rate_atom/max_bit_rate.md): A 32-bit unsigned integer that indicates the maximum bit rate in bits/second of the associated media stream.
- [Average bit rate](bit_rate_atom/average_bit_rate.md): A 32-bit unsigned integer that indicates the average bit rate in bits/second of the associated media stream.
