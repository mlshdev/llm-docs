# Sync sample atom ('stss')

**Framework:** QuickTime File Format  
**Kind:** Atom

An atom that identifies the key frames in the media.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

In a media that contains compressed data, key frames define starting points for portions of a temporally compressed sequence. The key frame is self-contained — that is, it is independent of preceding frames. Subsequent frames may depend on the key frame.

The sync sample atom provides a compact marking of the random access points within a stream. The table is arranged in strictly increasing order of sample number. If this table is not present, every sample is implicitly a random access point.

Sync sample atoms have an atom type of `'stss'`. The sync sample atom contains a table of sample numbers. Each entry in the table identifies a sample that is a key frame for the media. If no sync sample atom exists, then all the samples are key frames.

The layout of a sync sample atom is as follows.

| Sync sample atom data field | Bytes |
| --- | --- |
| [Size](sync_sample_atom/size.md) | 4 |
| [Type](sync_sample_atom/type.md) = `'stss'` | 4 |
| [Version](sync_sample_atom/version.md) | 1 |
| [Flags](sync_sample_atom/flags.md) | 3 |
| [Number of entries](sync_sample_atom/number_of_entries.md) | 4 |
| [Sync sample table](sync_sample_atom/sync_sample_table.md) | Variable |

## Topics

### Data fields

- [Size](sync_sample_atom/size.md): A 32-bit integer that specifies the number of bytes in this sync sample atom.
- [Type](sync_sample_atom/type.md): A 32-bit integer that identifies the atom type.
- [Version](sync_sample_atom/version.md): A 1-byte specification of the version of this sync sample atom.
- [Flags](sync_sample_atom/flags.md): A 3-byte space for sync sample flags.
- [Number of entries](sync_sample_atom/number_of_entries.md): A 32-bit integer containing the count of entries in the sync sample table.
- [Sync sample table](sync_sample_atom/sync_sample_table.md): A table of sample numbers.
