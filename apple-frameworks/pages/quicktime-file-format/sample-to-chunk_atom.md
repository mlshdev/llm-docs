# Sample-to-chunk atom ('stsc')

**Framework:** QuickTime File Format  
**Kind:** Atom

An atom that stores chunk information for the samples in a media.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

As samples are added to a media, they are collected into chunks that allow optimized data access. A chunk contains one or more samples. Chunks in a media may have different sizes, and the samples within a chunk may have different sizes. The sample-to-chunk atom stores chunk information for the samples in a media.

Sample-to-chunk atoms have an atom type of `'stsc'`. The sample-to-chunk atom contains a table that maps samples to chunks in the media data stream. By examining the sample-to-chunk atom, you can determine the chunk that contains a specific sample.

The layout of the sample-to-chunk atom is as follows.

| Sample-to-chunk atom data field | Bytes |
| --- | --- |
| [Size](sample-to-chunk_atom/size.md) | 4 |
| [Type](sample-to-chunk_atom/type.md) = `'stsc'` | 4 |
| [Version](sample-to-chunk_atom/version.md) | 1 |
| [Flags](sample-to-chunk_atom/flags.md) | 3 |
| [Number of entries](sample-to-chunk_atom/number_of_entries.md) | 4 |
| [Sample-to-chunk table](sample-to-chunk_atom/sample-to-chunk_table.md) | Variable |

## Topics

### Data fields

- [Size](sample-to-chunk_atom/size.md): A 32-bit integer that specifies the number of bytes in this sample-to-chunk atom.
- [Type](sample-to-chunk_atom/type.md): A 32-bit integer that identifies the atom type.
- [Version](sample-to-chunk_atom/version.md): A 1-byte specification of the version of this sample-to-chunk atom.
- [Flags](sample-to-chunk_atom/flags.md): A 3-byte space for sample-to-chunk flags.
- [Number of entries](sample-to-chunk_atom/number_of_entries.md): A 32-bit integer containing the count of entries in the sample-to-chunk table.
- [Sample-to-chunk table](sample-to-chunk_atom/sample-to-chunk_table.md): A table that maps samples to chunks.
