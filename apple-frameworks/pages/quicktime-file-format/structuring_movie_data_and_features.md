# Structuring movie data and features

**Framework:** QuickTime File Format

Build movies with compressed or reference data, and add features like effect descriptions and alternate subtitle tracks.

## Topics

### Movie data

- [Compressed movie resources](compressed_movie_resources.md): Reduce file size and startup latency by compressing movie resources.
- [Reference movies](reference_movies.md): A movie that contains references to alternate movies is called a reference movie.
- [Authoring movies with external movie targets](authoring_movies_with_external_movie_targets.md): Specify elements of an external movie in your movie.

### Movie features

- [Preparing sound and subtitle alternate groups for use with Apple devices](preparing_sound_and_subtitle_alternate_groups_for_use_with_apple_devices.md): Create collections of tracks that all serve the same purpose, where any track in the group can be substituted for another in a movie.
- [Creating an effect description](creating_an_effect_description.md): Tell QuickTime which effect to execute and control how the effect behaves at runtime with an effect description.
