# Hypertext and wired text

**Framework:** QuickTime File Format  
**Kind:** Article

Store hypertext in a text track sample atom.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

Hypertext is used as an action that takes you to a Web URL; like a Web URL, it appears blue and underlined. Hypertext is stored in a text track sample atom stream as type `'htxt'`. The same mechanism is used to store wired actions linked to text strings. A text string can be wired to act as a hypertext link when clicked or to perform any defined QuickTime wired action when clicked. For details on wired actions, see [Wired action grammar](wired_action_grammar.md).

The data stored is a `QTAtomContainer`. The root atom of hypertext in this container is a wired-text atom of type `'wtxt'`. This is the parent for all individual hypertext objects.

For each hypertext item, the parent atom is of type `'htxt'`. This is the atom container atom type. Two children of this atom that define the offset of the hypertext in the text stream are:

```c
kRangeStart         strt // unsigned long
kRangeEnd           end  // unsigned long
```

Child atoms of the parent atom are the events of type `kQTEventType` and the ID of the event type. The children of these event atoms follow the same format as other wired events.

```c
kQTEventType, (kQTEventMouseClick, kQTEventMouseClickEnd,
                    kQTEventMouseClickEndTriggerButton,
                    kQTEventMouseEnter, kQTEventMouseExit)
...
kTextWiredObjectsAtomType, 1
    kHyperTextItemAtomType, 1..n
         kRangeStart, 1
            long
        kRangeEnd, 1
            long
 
    kAction     // The known range of track movie sprite actions
 
```
