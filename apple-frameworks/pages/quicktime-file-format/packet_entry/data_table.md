# Data table

**Framework:** QuickTime File Format  
**Kind:** Data field

A table that defines the data to be put in the payload portion of the RTP packet.

## Mentioned In

- [Data modes](../data_modes.md)

## Overall

This table defines various places the data can be retrieved. Table entries are listed in the following table.

| Data table entry | Bytes |
| --- | --- |
| Data source | 1 |
| Data | 15 |

The data source field of the entry table indicates how the other 15 bytes of the entry are to be interpreted. Values of `0` through `4` are defined. The various data table formats are defined in [Data modes](../data_modes.md).

Although there are various schemes, note that the entries in the various schemes are the same size, 16 bytes long.
