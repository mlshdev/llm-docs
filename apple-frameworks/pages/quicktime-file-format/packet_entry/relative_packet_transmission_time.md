**Framework:** QuickTime File Format  
**Kind:** Data field

A 32-bit signed integer value, indicating the time, in the hint track’s time scale, to send this packet relative to the hint sample’s actual time.

## Overview

Negative values mean that the packet will be sent earlier than real time, which is useful for smoothing the data rate. Positive values are useful for repeating packets at later times. Within each hint sample track, each packet time stamp must be non-decreasing.
