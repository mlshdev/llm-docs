# Creating video tracks at 29.97 frames per second

**Framework:** QuickTime File Format  
**Kind:** Article

Configure your time-to-sample atom for 29.97 frames per second.

## Overview

NTSC color video is not `30` frames per second (fps), but actually `29.97` fps. The previous example showed how the media time scale and the duration of the frames specify the video’s frame rate. By setting the media’s time scale to `2997` units per second and setting the frame durations to `100` units each, the effective rate is `29.97` fps exactly.

In this situation, it is also a good idea to set the movie time scale to `2997` in order to avoid movie edits that don’t land on frame boundaries. The movie’s time scale is stored in the movie header atom.

With a time scale of `2997` in the media header atom, the time-to-sample atom would contain the data values listed in following table.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Atom size | `24` |
| Atom type | `'stts'` |
| Version/Flags | `0` |
| Number of entries | `1` |
| Sample count | `n` |
| Sample duration | `100` |
