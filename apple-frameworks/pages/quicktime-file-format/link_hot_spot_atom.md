# Link hot spot atom ('link')

**Framework:** QuickTime File Format  
**Kind:** Atom

## Overview

The link hot spot atom specifies information for hot spots of type `kQTVRHotSpotLinkType` (’`link'`). Its atom type is thus `'link'`. The link hot spot atom contains specific information about a link hot spot.

The structure of a link hot spot atom is defined by the `QTVRLinkHotSpotAtom` data type:

```c
typedef struct VRLinkHotSpotAtom {
    UInt16                              majorVersion;
    UInt16                              minorVersion;
    UInt32                              toNodeID;
    UInt32                              fromValidFlags;
    Float32                             fromPan;
    Float32                             fromTilt;
    Float32                             fromFOV;
    FloatPoint                          fromViewCenter;
    UInt32                              toValidFlags;
    Float32                             toPan;
    Float32                             toTilt;
    Float32                             toFOV;
    FloatPoint                          toViewCenter;
    Float32                             distance;
    UInt32                              flags;
    UInt32                              reserved1;
    UInt32                              reserved2;
} VRLinkHotSpotAtom, *VRLinkHotSpotAtomPtr;
```

Certain fields in the link hot spot atom are not used by QuickTime VR. The `fromValidFlags` field is generally set to 0 and the other `from` fields are not used. However, these fields could be quite useful if you have created a transition movie from one node to another. The from angles can be used to swing the current view of the source node to align with the first frame of the transition movie. The `distance` field is intended for use with 3D applications, but is also not used by QuickTime VR.
