# Timecode sample data

**Framework:** QuickTime File Format  
**Kind:** Atom

An atom that represents timecode sample data.

## Overview

A timecode media sample is recorded as a 32-bit integer, interpreted based on the value of the Counter flag in the timecode sample description.

If the Counter flag is set to `1` in the timecode sample description, the sample data is an unsigned 32-bit integer. The timecode counter value is determined by dividing this unsigned 32-bit integer by the number of frames field in the timecode sample description.

If the Counter flag is set to `0` in the timecode sample description, the sample data format is a signed 32-bit integer and is used to calculate a timecode record.

## Topics

### Data fields

- [Hours](timecode_sample_data/hours.md): An 8-bit unsigned integer that indicates the starting number of hours.
- [Negative](timecode_sample_data/negative.md): A 1-bit value indicating the time’s sign.
- [Minutes](timecode_sample_data/minutes.md): A 7-bit integer that contains the starting number of minutes.
- [Seconds](timecode_sample_data/seconds.md): An 8-bit unsigned integer indicating the starting number of seconds.
- [Frames](timecode_sample_data/frames.md): An 8-bit unsigned integer that specifies the starting number of frames.
