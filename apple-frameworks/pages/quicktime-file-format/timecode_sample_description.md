## Overview

The timecode sample description contains information that defines how to interpret time code media data. This sample description is based on the standard sample description header, as described in [Sample description atom](sample_description_atom.md).

The data format field in the sample description is always set to `'tmcd'`.

The timecode media handler also adds some of its own fields to the sample description.

## Topics

### Data fields

- [Reserved](timecode_sample_description/reserved.md): A 32-bit integer that is reserved for future use.
- [Flags](timecode_sample_description/flags.md): A 32-bit integer containing flags that identify some timecode characteristics.
- [Time scale](timecode_sample_description/time_scale.md): A 32-bit integer that specifies the time scale for interpreting the frame duration field.
- [Frame duration](timecode_sample_description/frame_duration.md): A 32-bit integer that indicates how long each frame lasts in real time.
- [Number of frames](timecode_sample_description/number_of_frames.md): An 8-bit integer that contains the number of frames per second for the timecode format.
