# Chunk offset atom ('stco')

**Framework:** QuickTime File Format  
**Kind:** Atom

An atom that identifies the location of each chunk of data in the media’s data stream.

## Overview

Chunk offset atoms have an atom type of `'stco'`.

The chunk-offset table gives the index of each chunk into the containing file. There are two variants, permitting the use of 32-bit or 64-bit offsets. The latter is useful when managing very large movies. Only one of these variants occurs in any single instance of a sample table atom.

Note that offsets are file offsets, not the offset into any atom within the file (for example, a `'mdat'` atom). This permits referring to media data in files without any atom structure. However, be careful when constructing a self-contained QuickTime file with its metadata (movie atom) at the front because the size of the movie atom affects the chunk offsets to the media data.

> **Note**

> The sample table atom can contain a 64-bit chunk offset atom (`STChunkOffset64AID = 'co64'`). When this atom appears, it is used in place of the original chunk offset atom, which can contain only 32-bit offsets. When QuickTime writes movie files, it uses the 64-bit chunk offset atom only if there are chunks that use the high 32-bits of the chunk offset. Otherwise, the original 32-bit chunk offset atom is used to ensure compatibility with previous versions of QuickTime.

The layout of a chunk offset atom is as follows.

| Chunk offset atom data field | Bytes |
| --- | --- |
| [Size](chunk_offset_atom/size.md) | 4 |
| [Type](chunk_offset_atom/type.md) = `'stco'` | 4 |
| [Version](chunk_offset_atom/version.md) | 1 |
| [Flags](chunk_offset_atom/flags.md) | 3 |
| [Number of entries](chunk_offset_atom/number_of_entries.md) | 4 |
| [Chunk offset table](chunk_offset_atom/chunk_offset_table.md) | Variable |

## Topics

### Data fields

- [Size](chunk_offset_atom/size.md): A 32-bit integer that specifies the number of bytes in this chunk offset atom.
- [Type](chunk_offset_atom/type.md): A 32-bit integer that identifies the atom type.
- [Version](chunk_offset_atom/version.md): A 1-byte specification of the version of this chunk offset atom.
- [Flags](chunk_offset_atom/flags.md): A 3-byte space for chunk offset flags.
- [Number of entries](chunk_offset_atom/number_of_entries.md): A 32-bit integer containing the count of entries in the chunk offset table.
