# Edit list table

**Framework:** QuickTime File Format  
**Kind:** Data field

An array of 32-bit values, grouped into entries containing 3 values each.

## Overview

The layout of the entries in this table is as follows.

| Field | Bytes |
| --- | --- |
| Track duration | 4 |
| Media time | 4 |
| Media rate | 4 |

An edit list table entry contains the following elements.

- **Track duration**: A 32-bit integer that specifies the duration of this edit segment in units of the movie’s time scale.
- **Media time**: A 32-bit integer containing the starting time within the media of this edit segment (in media timescale units). If this field is set to `–1`, it is an empty edit. The last edit in a track should never be an empty edit. Any difference between the movie’s duration and the track’s duration is expressed as an implicit empty edit.
- **Media rate**: A 32-bit fixed-point number that specifies the relative rate at which to play the media corresponding to this edit segment. This rate value cannot be `0` or negative.
