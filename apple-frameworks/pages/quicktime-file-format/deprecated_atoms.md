- [Track profile atom](track_profile_atom.md): Deprecated. A child atom of movie atoms or track atoms.
- [Appendix F: Profile atom guidelines](appendix_f_profile_atom_guidelines.md): Summarize profile information about a QuickTime movie so readers can easily determine features and complexity.

### Media data atom types

- [Sprite media](sprite_media.md): Sprite media is used to store character-based animation data in QuickTime movies.
- [Sprite track properties](sprite_track_properties.md): Define properties that apply to an entire sprite track.
- [Sprite track media format](sprite_track_media_format.md): A media format for that stores sprite track information in atoms.
- [Sprite media atom and data types](sprite_media_atom_and_data_types.md): Atoms that represent sprite media and data types.
- [Sprite button behaviors](sprite_button_behaviors.md): Specify simple button behaviors for sprites in a sprite track.
