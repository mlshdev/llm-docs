# Playing with edit lists

**Framework:** QuickTime File Format  
**Kind:** Article

Repeat a segment of a movie without copying media with edit lists.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

A segment of a movie can be repeated without duplicating media data by using edit lists. Suppose you have a single-track movie whose media time scale is `100` and track duration is `1000` (10 seconds). For this example the movie’s time scale is `600`. If there are no edits in the movie, the edit atom would contain the data values:

```
Edit list atom
├── Atom size: 36
├── Atom type: 'edts'
└── Edit list table atom
    ├── Atom size: 28
    ├── Atom type: 'elst'
    ├── Version/Flags: 0
    ├── Number of entries: 2
    ├── Track duration: 6000 (10 seconds)
    ├── Media time: 0
    └── Media rate: 1.0
```

Because this is a single-track move, the track’s duration in the track header atom is `6000` and the movie’s duration in the movie header atom is `6000`.

If you change the track to play the media from time `0` to time `2` seconds, and then play the media from time `0` to time `10` seconds, the edit atom would now contain these data values:

```
Edit list atom
├── Atom size: 48
├── Atom type: 'edts'
└── Edit list table atom
    ├── Atom size: 40
    ├── Atom type: 'elst'
    ├── Version/Flags: 0
    ├── Number of entries: 2
    ├── Track duration[1]: 1200 (2 seconds)
    ├── Media time[1]: 0
    ├── Media rate[1]: 1.0
    ├── Track duration[2]: 6000 (10 seconds)
    ├── Media time[2]: 0
    └── Media rate[2]: 1.0
```

Because the track is now 2 seconds longer, the track’s duration in the track header atom must now be `7200`, and the movie’s duration in the movie header atom must also be `7200`.

Currently, the media plays from time `0` to time `2`, then plays from time `0` to time `10`. If you take that repeated segment at the beginning (time `0` to time `2`) and play it at double speed to maintain the original duration, the edit atom would now contain the following values:

```
Edit list atom
├── Atom size: 60
├── Atom type: 'edts'
└── Edit list table atom
    ├── Atom size: 52
    ├── Atom type: 'elst'
    ├── Version/Flags: 0
    ├── Number of entries: 3
    ├── Track duration[1]: 600 (1 second)
    ├── Media time[1]: 0
    ├── Media rate[1]: 2.0
    ├── Track duration[2]: 600 (1 second)
    ├── Media time[2]: 0
    ├── Media rate[2]: 2.0
    ├── Track duration[3]: 4800 (8 seconds)
    ├── Media time[3]: 200
    └── Media rate[3]: 1.0
```

Because the track is now back to its original duration of 10 seconds, its duration in the track header atom is `6000`, and the movie’s duration in the movie header atom is `6000`.
