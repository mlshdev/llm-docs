# Edit atom ('edts')

**Framework:** QuickTime File Format  
**Kind:** Atom

An atom that defines the portions of the media that are to be used to build up a track for a movie.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

You use edit atoms to define the portions of the media that are to be used to build up a track for a movie. The edits themselves are contained in an edit list table, which consists of time offset and duration values for each segment. Edit atoms have an atom type value of `'edts'`.

In the absence of an edit list, the presentation of a track starts immediately. An empty edit is used to offset the start time of a track.

> **Note**

> If the edit atom or the edit list atom is missing, you can assume that the entire media is used by the track.

## Topics

### Data fields

- [Size](edit_atom/size.md): A 32-bit integer that specifies the number of bytes in this edit atom.
- [Type](edit_atom/type.md): A 32-bit integer that identifies the atom type.
- [Edit list atom](edit_atom/edit_list_atom.md): An atom that maps from a time in a movie to a time in a media, and ultimately to media data.
