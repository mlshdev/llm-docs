**Framework:** QuickTime File Format  
**Kind:** Atom

An atom that specifies the characteristics of a single track within a movie.

## Overview

The track header atom specifies the characteristics of a single track within a movie. A track header atom contains a size field that specifies the number of bytes and a type field that indicates the format of the data (defined by the atom type `'tkhd'`).

The layout of a track header atom is as follows.

| Data field | Bytes |
| --- | --- |
| [Size](track_header_atom/size.md) | 4 |
| [Type](track_header_atom/type.md) | 4 |
| [Version](track_header_atom/version.md) | 1 |
| [Flags](track_header_atom/flags.md) | 3 |
| [Creation time](track_header_atom/creation_time.md) | 4 |
| [Modification time](track_header_atom/modification_time.md) | 4 |
| [Track ID](track_header_atom/track_id.md) | 4 |
| [Reserved](track_header_atom/reserved.md) | 4 |
| [Duration](track_header_atom/duration.md) | 4 |
| [Reserved](track_header_atom/reserved_2.md) | 8 |
| [Layer](track_header_atom/layer.md) | 2 |
| [Alternate group](track_header_atom/alternate_group.md) | 2 |
| [Volume](track_header_atom/volume.md) | 2 |
| [Reserved](track_header_atom/reserved_3.md) | 2 |
| [Matrix structure](track_header_atom/matrix_structure.md) | 36 |
| [Track width](track_header_atom/track_width.md) | 4 |
| [Track height](track_header_atom/track_height.md) | 4 |

The track header atom contains the track characteristics for the track, including temporal, spatial, and volume information.

## Topics

### Data fields

- [Size](track_header_atom/size.md): A 32-bit integer that specifies the number of bytes in this track header atom.
- [Type](track_header_atom/type.md): A 32-bit integer that identifies the atom type.
- [Version](track_header_atom/version.md): A 1-byte specification of the version of this track header.
- [Flags](track_header_atom/flags.md): Three bytes that are reserved for the track header flags.
- [Creation time](track_header_atom/creation_time.md): A 32-bit integer that indicates the creation calendar date and time for the track header.
- [Modification time](track_header_atom/modification_time.md): A 32-bit integer that indicates the last change date for the track header.
- [Track ID](track_header_atom/track_id.md): A 32-bit integer that uniquely identifies the track.
- [Reserved](track_header_atom/reserved.md): A 32-bit integer that is reserved for use by Apple.
- [Duration](track_header_atom/duration.md): A time value that indicates the duration of this track, in the movie’s time coordinate system.
- [Reserved](track_header_atom/reserved_2.md): An 8-byte value that is reserved for use by Apple.
- [Layer](track_header_atom/layer.md): A 16-bit integer that indicates this track’s spatial priority in its movie.
- [Alternate group](track_header_atom/alternate_group.md): A 16-bit integer that identifies a collection of movie tracks that contain alternate data for one another.
- [Volume](track_header_atom/volume.md): A 16-bit fixed-point value that indicates how loudly to play this track’s sound.
- [Reserved](track_header_atom/reserved_3.md): A 16-bit integer that is reserved for use by Apple.
- [Matrix structure](track_header_atom/matrix_structure.md): The matrix structure associated with this track.
- [Track width](track_header_atom/track_width.md): A 32-bit fixed-point number that specifies the width of this track in pixels.
- [Track height](track_header_atom/track_height.md): A 32-bit fixed-point number that indicates the height of this track in pixels.
