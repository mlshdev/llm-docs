## Overview

| OpenDML and other AVI files | Description |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
| Supported by | Movie import component |
| Macintosh file type | `'VfW '` |
| File name extensions | .avi |
| metadata handling | All Microsoft-defined “tombstone” data is transferred to the imported movie’s user data. Metadata fields that have QuickTime equivalents are mapped as follows: `'ICOP'` maps to `kUserDataTextCopyright`, `'ISBJ'` maps to `kUserDataTextInformation`, `'INAM'` maps to `kUserDataTextFullName`, `'ICRD'` maps to `'©day'`, `'IMED'` maps to `'©fmt'`, `'ISRC'` maps to `'©src'`. Where no QuickTime equivalent exists, the metadata item’s four-character code is modified by replacing the initial `I` with the symbol `©`. All other characters remain unchanged. |
| Software required | QuickTime 3 |
