## Overview

The clipping atom has an atom type value of `'clip'`.

The layout of a clipping atom is as follows.

| Data field | Bytes |
| --- | --- |
| [Size](clipping_atom/size.md) | 4 |
| [Type](clipping_atom/type.md) | 4 |
| [Clipping region atom](clipping_atom/clipping_region_atom.md) | Variable |

## Topics

### Data fields

- [Size](clipping_atom/size.md): A 32-bit integer that specifies the number of bytes in this clipping atom.
- [Type](clipping_atom/type.md): A 32-bit integer that identifies the atom type.
- [Clipping region atom](clipping_atom/clipping_region_atom.md): An atom that specifies the clipping region.
