# Low-resolution image tracks

**Framework:** QuickTime File Format  
**Kind:** Article

Create low resolution image tracks for low memory conditions.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

It’s possible to store one or more low-resolution versions of a panoramic image in a movie file; those versions are called low-resolution image tracks. If there is not enough memory at runtime to use the normal image track, QuickTime VR uses a lower resolution image track if one is available. A low-resolution image track contains diced frames just like the higher resolution track, but the reconstructed panoramic image is half the height and half the width of the higher resolution image.

> **Important**

> The panoramic images in the lower resolution image tracks and the hot spot image tracks, if present, must have the same orientation (horizontal or vertical) as the panorama image track.
