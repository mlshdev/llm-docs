# Creating sound tracks at 44.1 kHz

**Framework:** QuickTime File Format  
**Kind:** Article

Configure your time-to-sample atom for sound at 44.1 kHz.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

The duration of an audio sample is stored in the time-to-sample atom contained in a sample table atom. This duration cannot be interpreted without the media’s time scale, which defines the units per second for the duration. With audio, the duration of each audio sample is typically `1`, so the time-to-sample atom has one entry, which applies to all audio samples.

With a time scale of `44100` in the media header atom, the time-to-sample atom would contain the data values listed in the following table.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Atom size | `24` |
| Atom type | `'stts'` |
| Version/Flags | `0` |
| Number of entries | `1` |
| Sample count | `n` |
| Sample duration | `1` |

This atom does not indicate whether the audio is stereo or mono or whether it contains 8-bit or 16-bit samples. That information is stored in the sound sample description atom, which is contained in the sample table atom.
