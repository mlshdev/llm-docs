## Overview

This atom contains an MPEG-4 decoder configuration atom. This is a required extension to the video sample description for H.264 video. This extension appears in video sample descriptions only when the codec type is `‘avc1’`.

> **Note**

> The decoder configuration record that this atom contains is defined in the MPEG-4 specification ISO/IEC FDIS 14496-15.

## Topics

### Data fields

- [Size](avc_decoder_configuration_atom/size.md): An unsigned 32-bit integer holding the size of the AVC decoder configuration atom.
- [Type](avc_decoder_configuration_atom/type.md): An unsigned 32-bit field.
- [AVC decoder configuration record](avc_decoder_configuration_atom/avc_decoder_configuration_record.md): A record that configures the AVC decoder.
