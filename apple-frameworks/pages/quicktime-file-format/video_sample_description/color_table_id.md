# Color table ID

**Framework:** QuickTime File Format  
**Kind:** Data field

A 16-bit integer that identifies which color table to use.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

If this field is set to –1, the default color table should be used for the specified depth. For all depths below 16 bits per pixel, this indicates a standard Macintosh color table for the specified depth. Depths of 16, 24, and 32 have no color table.

If the color table ID is set to 0, a color table is contained within the sample description itself. The color table immediately follows the color table ID field in the sample description. See [Color table atom](../color_table_atom.md) for a complete description of a color table.
