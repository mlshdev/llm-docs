# VR media

**Framework:** QuickTime File Format  
**Kind:** API Collection

Atoms that describe the QuickTime VR world.

## Overview

> **Important**

> VR Media is deprecated in the QuickTime file format. The information that follows documents existing content containing VR Media and should not be used for new development.

This section describes the QuickTime VR world and node information atom containers, which can be obtained by calling the QuickTime VR Manager routines `QTVRGetVRWorld` and `QTVRGetNodeInfo`. Those routines, as well as a complete discussion of QuickTime VR and how your application can create QuickTime VR movies, are described in detail in [QuickTime VR](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/QuickTime/InsideQT_QTVR/0Preface/QTVR-preface.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40000944).

Many atom types contained in the VR world and node information atom containers are unique within their container. For example, each has a single header atom. Most parent atoms within an atom container are unique as well, such as the node parent atom in the VR world atom container or the hot spot parent atom in the node information atom container. For these one-time-only atoms, the atom ID is always set to `1`. Unless otherwise mentioned in the descriptions of the atoms that follow, assume that the atom ID is `1`.

Note that many atom structures contain two version fields, `majorVersion` and `minorVersion`. The values of these fields correspond to the constants `kQTVRMajorVersion` and `kQTVRMinorVersion` found in the header file `QuickTimeVRFormat.h`. For QuickTime 2.0 files, these values are `2` and `0`.

QuickTime provides a number of routines for both creating and accessing atom containers.

Some of the leaf atoms within the VR world and node information atom containers contain fields that specify the ID of string atoms that are siblings of the leaf atom. For example, the VR world header atom contains a field for the name of the scene. The string atom is a leaf atom whose atom type is `kQTVRStringAtomType` (`'vrsg'`). Its atom ID is that specified by the referring leaf atom.

## Topics

### Describing VR worlds

- [QTVR string atom](qtvr_string_atom.md): Deprecated. An atom that contains a string for QuickTime VR.
- [VR world atom container](vr_world_atom_container.md): Deprecated. An atom that contains name for the entire scene, the default node ID, and default imaging properties, as well as a list of the nodes contained in the QTVR track.
- [VR world header atom](vr_world_header_atom.md): Deprecated. An atom contains the name of the scene and the default node ID to be used when the file is first opened.
- [Imaging parent atom](imaging_parent_atom.md): Deprecated. An atom that is the parent atom of one or more node-specific imaging atoms.
- [Panorama imaging atom](panorama_imaging_atom.md): Deprecated. An atom describes the default imaging characteristics for all the panoramic nodes in a scene.
