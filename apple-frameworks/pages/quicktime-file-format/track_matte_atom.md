## Overview

Track matte atoms are used to visually blend the track’s image when it is displayed.

Track matte atoms have an atom type value of `'matt'`.

The layout of a track matte atom is as follows.

| Track matte atom | Bytes |
| --- | --- |
| [Size](track_matte_atom/size.md) | 4 |
| [Type](track_matte_atom/type.md) | 4 |
| [Compressed matte atom](track_matte_atom/compressed_matte_atom.md) | Variable |

## Topics

### Data fields

- [Size](track_matte_atom/size.md): A 32-bit integer that specifies the number of bytes in this track matte atom.
- [Type](track_matte_atom/type.md): A 32-bit integer that identifies the atom type.
- [Compressed matte atom](track_matte_atom/compressed_matte_atom.md): An atom that specifies the image description structure and the matte data associated with a particular matte atom.
