**Framework:** QuickTime File Format  
**Kind:** Atom

An atom that specifies the image description structure and the matte data associated with a particular matte atom.

## Overview

The compressed matte atom specifies the image description structure and the matte data associated with a particular matte atom. Compressed matte atoms have an atom type value of `'kmat'`.

The layout of the compressed matte atom is as follows.

| Compressed matte atom | Bytes |
| --- | --- |
| [Size](compressed_matte_atom/size.md) | 4 |
| [Type](compressed_matte_atom/type.md) | 4 |
| [Version](compressed_matte_atom/version.md) | 1 |
| [Flags](compressed_matte_atom/flags.md) | 3 |
| [Matte image description structure](compressed_matte_atom/matte_image_description_structure.md) | Variable |
| [Matte data](compressed_matte_atom/matte_data.md) | Variable |

## Topics

### Data fields

- [Size](compressed_matte_atom/size.md): A 32-bit integer that specifies the number of bytes in this compressed matte atom.
- [Type](compressed_matte_atom/type.md): A 32-bit integer that identifies the atom type.
- [Version](compressed_matte_atom/version.md): A 1-byte specification of the version of this compressed matte atom.
- [Flags](compressed_matte_atom/flags.md): Three bytes of space for flags.
- [Matte image description structure](compressed_matte_atom/matte_image_description_structure.md): An image description structure associated with this matte data.
- [Matte data](compressed_matte_atom/matte_data.md): The compressed matte data, which is of variable length.
