## Overview

The text sample description contains information that defines how to interpret text media data. This sample description is based on the standard sample description header, as described in [Sample description atom](sample_description_atom.md).

The data format field in the sample description is always set to `'text'`.

The text media handler also adds some of its own fields to the sample description.
