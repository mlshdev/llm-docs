# MPEG-4 video profile

**Framework:** QuickTime File Format  
**Kind:** Article

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

- **Containing profile atom**: Track (video), movie
- **`part-ID`**: `0x20202020` (universal feature)
- **`feature-code`**: ’`m4vp'`
- **`feature-value`**: Unsigned `int(32)` where least significant 8 bits hold the `profile_and_level_indication` from the `visual_object_sequence`, as defined in specification ISO/IEC 14496-2, retrieved from the video parameters for the MPEG-4 video codec description. The top 24 bits must be set to `0`.

<a id="Feature-Values"></a>

## Feature Values

The least significant 8 bits hold the value. The most significant 24 bits of the feature value should be set to `0`.

<a id="Writer-Responsibilities"></a>

## Writer Responsibilities

A writer of the MPEG-4 video profile feature should record the 8 bits corresponding to the `profile_and_level_indication` from the `visual_object_sequence`, as defined in specification ISO/IEC 14496-2, found in the video parameters encoded in the esds of the MPEG-4 video codec sample description (with QuickTime codec type `'mp4v'`).

> **Note**

> A writer that records the MPEG-4 video profile feature is encouraged also to write the QuickTime Video Codec Type feature.

<a id="Feature-Value-Algorithm"></a>

## Feature Value Algorithm

The feature value is the `profile_and_level_indication` from the `visual_object_sequence`, as defined in specification ISO/IEC 14496-2, retrieved from the video parameters for the MPEG-4 video codec description.

<a id="Reader-Responsibilities"></a>

## Reader Responsibilities

A reader of this feature code should compare the recorded value with the set of profiles and levels supported by the reader.

<a id="Comments"></a>

## Comments

This feature may be present only if MPEG-4 video is used. Normally, the video codec type profile entry will also record that MPEG-4 video is present, unless no codec types are present (when, for example, an exhaustive list cannot be formed).
