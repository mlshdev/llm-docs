# Subtitle sample description

**Framework:** QuickTime File Format  
**Kind:** Atom

An atom that defines how to interpret subtitle media data.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

The subtitle sample description contains information that defines how to interpret subtitle media data. This sample description is based on the standard sample description header, as described in [Sample description atom](sample_description_atom.md).

> **Note**

> Only one sample description is permitted in a `'sbtl'` track.

The data format field in the sample description is currently always set to `'tx3g'`. Unrecognized data formats should be ignored. The text media described here is based on the text box defined in the 3GPP Timed Text specification but provides a different track type and media handler designed specifically for subtitles.

The subtitle media handler adds some of its own fields to the sample description.
