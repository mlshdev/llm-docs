# Hot spot information atom ('hsin')

**Framework:** QuickTime File Format  
**Kind:** Atom

An atom that contains general information about a hot spot.

## Overview

The hot spot information atom contains general information about a hot spot. Its atom type is `kQTVRHotSpotInfoAtomType` (`'hsin'`). Every hot spot atom should have a hot spot information atom as a child.

The structure of a hot spot information atom is defined by the `QTVRHotSpotInfoAtom` data type:

```c
typedef struct VRHotSpotInfoAtom {
    UInt16                              majorVersion;
    UInt16                              minorVersion;
    OSType                              hotSpotType;
    QTAtomID                            nameAtomID;
    QTAtomID                            commentAtomID;
    SInt32                              cursorID[3];
    Float32                             bestPan;
    Float32                             bestTilt;
    Float32                             bestFOV;
    FloatPoint                          bestViewCenter;
    Rect                                hotSpotRect;
    UInt32                              flags;
    UInt32                              reserved1;
    UInt32                              reserved2;
} VRHotSpotInfoAtom, *QTVRHotSpotInfoAtomPtr;
```
