# Metadata handling

**Framework:** QuickTime File Format

Handling metadata in other file formats.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

This section describes how metadata is handled when QuickTime imports other file formats. For more information about metadata, refer to [Metadata atoms and types](metadata_atoms_and_types.md) and [Compressed movie resources](compressed_movie_resources.md).

Each section includes a table with specific details on the following, where applicable:

- The format supported by QuickTime — for example, the movie import component or the graphics import component.
- The Macintosh file type — for example, `'Mp3 '`.
- File name extensions — for example, `.mp3`.
- Specific details for metadata handling — for example, all Microsoft-defined “tombstone” data is transferred to the imported movie’s user data. Metadata fields that have QuickTime equivalents are mapped as follows.
- Software required — for example, QuickTime 3 or later.

- [Location metadata](location_metadata.md): Storing the location coordinates, as well as several auxiliary pieces of information about a location, as metadata.
- [QuickTime metadata keys](quicktime_metadata_keys.md): Use QuickTime keys to hold data in a Metadata atom.
