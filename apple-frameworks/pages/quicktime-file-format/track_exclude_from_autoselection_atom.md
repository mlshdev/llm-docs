**Kind:** Atom

An atom that indicates not to automatically select this track.

## Overview

Some alternate tracks contain something other than a direct translation (or untranslated written form) of the primary content. Commentary tracks are one example. Don’t automatically select these tracks. The presence of the Track Exclude From Autoselection atom in a track indicates not to automatically select this track.

Ensure that such tracks have user-readable names that help users to identify the purpose of the track. These names are stored in one or more track name (`'tnam'`) atoms, each translated into a different language, within a user data (`'udta'`) atom within the `'trak'` atom.

The type of the Track Exclude From Autoselection atom is `'txas'`. This atom, if used, must be somewhere after the `'tkhd'` atom.

## Topics
