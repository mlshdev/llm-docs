**Framework:** QuickTime File Format  
**Kind:** Article

Flags that adjust the behavior of the movie import component.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

- **`canMovieImportInPlace`**: Set this bit if a movie import component must be able to create a movie from a file without having to write to a separate disk file. Examples include MPEG and AIFF import components.
- **`movieImportSubTypeIsFileExtension`**: Set this bit if the component’s subtype is a file extension instead of a Macintosh file type. For example, if you require an import component that opens files with an extension of .doc, set this flag and set your component subtype to ’DOC ’.
- **`canMovieImportFiles`**: Set this bit if a movie import component must import files.
