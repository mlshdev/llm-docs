# Balance

**Framework:** QuickTime File Format  
**Kind:** Article

Represent balance values with 16-bit fixed-point numbers.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

Represent balance values as 16-bit, fixed-point numbers that range from `-1.0` to `+1.0`. The high-order 8 bits contain the integer portion of the value; the low-order 8 bits contain the fractional part. Negative values weight the balance toward the left speaker; positive values emphasize the right channel. Setting the balance to `0` corresponds to a neutral setting.
