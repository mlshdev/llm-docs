## Overview

It can optionally contain a list of system requirements in order for each movie to play, and a quality rating for each movie. It is typically used to specify a list of alternate movies to be played under different conditions.

A reference movie atom’s parent is always a movie atom (`'moov'`). Only one reference movie atom is allowed in a given movie atom.
