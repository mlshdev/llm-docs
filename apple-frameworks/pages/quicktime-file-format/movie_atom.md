# Movie atom ('moov')

**Framework:** QuickTime File Format  
**Kind:** Atom

An atom that specifies the information that defines a movie.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

You use movie atoms to specify the information that defines a movie — that is, the information that allows your application to interpret the sample data that is stored elsewhere. The movie atom usually contains a movie header atom, which defines the time scale and duration information for the entire movie, as well as its display characteristics. Existing movies may contain a movie profile atom, which summarizes the main features of the movie, such as the necessary codecs and maximum bit rate. In addition, the movie atom contains a track atom for each track in the movie.

The movie atom has an atom type of `'moov'`. It contains other types of atoms, including at least one of three possible atoms—the movie header atom (`'mvhd'`), the compressed movie atom (`'cmov'`), or a reference movie atom (`'rmra'`). An uncompressed movie atom can contain both a movie header atom and a reference movie atom, but it must contain at least one of the two. It can also contain several other atoms, such as a clipping atom (`'clip'`), one or more track atoms (`'trak'`), a color table atom (`'ctab'`), and a user data atom (`'udta'`).

Compressed movie atoms and reference movie atoms are discussed separately. This section describes normal uncompressed movie atoms.

The layout of movie atom is as follows.

| Data | Type |
| --- | --- |
| [Size](movie_atom/size.md) | 4 bytes |
| [Type](movie_atom/type.md) = `'moov'` | 4 bytes |
| [Profile atom](movie_atom/profile_atom.md) | `'prfl'` |
| [Movie header atom](movie_atom/movie_header_atom.md) | `'mvhd'`‡ |
| [Movie clipping atom](movie_atom/movie_clipping_atom.md) | `'clip'` |
| One or more [Track atoms](movie_atom/track_atoms.md) | `'trak'` |
| [User data atom](movie_atom/user_data_atom.md) | `'udta'` |
| [Color table atom](movie_atom/color_table_atom.md) | `'ctab'` |
| [Compressed movie atom](movie_atom/compressed_movie_atom.md) | `'cmov'` |
| [Reference movie atom](movie_atom/reference_movie_atom.md) | `'rmra'` |

‡ denotes required atom.
