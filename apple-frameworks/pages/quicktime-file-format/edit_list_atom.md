## Overview

You use the edit list atom to map from a time in a movie to a time in a media, and ultimately to media data. This information is in the form of entries in an edit list table. Edit list atoms have an atom type value of `'elst'`.

## Topics

### Data fields

- [Size](edit_list_atom/size.md): A 32-bit integer that specifies the number of bytes in this edit list atom.
- [Type](edit_list_atom/type.md): A 32-bit integer that identifies the atom type.
- [Version](edit_list_atom/version.md): A 1-byte specification of the version of this edit list atom.
- [Flags](edit_list_atom/flags.md): Three bytes of space for flags.
- [Number of entries](edit_list_atom/number_of_entries.md): A 32-bit integer that specifies the number of entries in the edit list atom.
- [Edit list table](edit_list_atom/edit_list_table.md): An array of 32-bit values, grouped into entries containing 3 values each.
