# VR world atom container

**Framework:** QuickTime File Format  
**Kind:** Atom

An atom that contains name for the entire scene, the default node ID, and default imaging properties, as well as a list of the nodes contained in the QTVR track.

## Overview

The VR world atom container (VR world for short) includes such information as the name for the entire scene, the default node ID, and default imaging properties, as well as a list of the nodes contained in the QTVR track.

A VR world can also contain custom scene information. QuickTime VR ignores any atom types that it doesn’t recognize, but you can extract those atoms from the VR world using standard QuickTime atom functions.

The following shows the structure of the VR world atom container. The component atoms are defined and their structures are shown in the sections that follow.
