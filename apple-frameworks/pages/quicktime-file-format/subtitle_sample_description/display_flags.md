# Display flags

**Framework:** QuickTime File Format  
**Kind:** Data field

A 32-bit integer containing flags that describe how the subtitle text should be drawn.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

The following flags are defined:

- **Vertical placement**: Controls vertical placement of the subtitle text. If this flag is set, the subtitle media handler uses the top coordinate of the display bounds of the override `'tbox'` text box to determine the subtitle’s vertical placement as described in [Subtitle track header size and placement](../subtitle_track_header_size_and_placement.md). Otherwise, the subtitle displays at the bottom of the video. This flag’s value is `0x20000000`.
- **Some samples are forced**: Indicates whether any subtitle samples contain forced atoms. If this flag is set, at least one sample contains a forced (`'frcd'`) atom as described in [Subtitle sample data](../subtitle_sample_data.md). This flag’s value is `0x40000000`.
- **All samples are forced**: If this flag is set, the subtitle media handler treats all samples as forced subtitles, regardless of the presence or absence of a `'frcd'` atom. This flag’s value is `0x80000000`. If this flag is set, the Some Samples Are Forced flag must also be set (making `0xC0000000`).
