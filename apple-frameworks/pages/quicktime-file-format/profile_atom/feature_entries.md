# Feature entries

**Framework:** QuickTime File Format  
**Kind:** Data field

A list of feature entries.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

Each feature entry consists of:

- **`reserved`**: A 32-bit field that must be set to zero.
- **`part-ID`**: Either a brand identifier that occurs in the file-type atom of the same file, indicating a feature that is specific to this brand, or the value `0x20202020` (four ASCII spaces) indicating a universal feature that can be found in any file type that allows the profile atom. The value 0 is reserved for an empty slot.
- **`feature-code`**: A four-character code either documented here (universal features), or in the specification identified by the brand. The value of `0` is reserved for an empty slot with no meaningful feature-value.
- **`feature-value`**: Either a value from an enumerated set (for example, `1` or `0` for `true` or `false`, or an MPEG-4 profile-level ID) or a value that can compared (for example, bit rate as an integer or dimensions as a 32-bit packed structure).

The following table shows the layout of a typical feature.

| Data field | Bytes |
| --- | --- |
| Reserved = `0x00000000` | 4 |
| Part ID = ’ ’ (`0x20202020`) | 4 |
| Feature code = `'avbr'` | 4 |
| Value = `0x00000001` | 4 |

- [Version](version.md): An 8-bit integer that holds the version.
- [Flags](flags.md): An 8-bit integer with flags.
- [Number of feature entries](number_of_feature_entries.md): A 32-bit integer that indicates how many feature entries are in the atom.
