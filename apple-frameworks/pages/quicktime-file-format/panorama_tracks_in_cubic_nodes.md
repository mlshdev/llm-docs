# Panorama tracks in cubic nodes

**Framework:** QuickTime File Format  
**Kind:** Article

Specify special values in the pano sample data atom to provide compatibility back to QuickTime VR 2.2.

## Overview

> **Important**

> VR Media is deprecated in the QuickTime file format. The information that follows documents existing content containing VR Media and should not be used for new development.

The media sample for a panorama track contains the pano sample atom container. For cubes, some of the fields in the pano sample data atom have special values, which provide compatibility back to QuickTime VR 2.2. The cubic projection engine ignores these fields. They allow one to view cubic movies in older versions of QuickTime VR using the cylindrical engine, although the view will be somewhat incorrect, and the top and bottom faces will not be visible. The special values are shown in the following table.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `imageNumFramesX` | `4` |
| `imageNumFramesY` | `1` |
| `imageSizeX` | Frame width \* `4` |
| `imageSizeY` | Frame height |
| `minPan` | `0.0` |
| `maxPan` | `360.0` |
| `minTilt` | `-45.0` |
| `maxTilt` | `45.0` |
| `minFieldOfView` | `5.0` |
| `maxFieldOfView` | `90.0` |
| `flags` | `1` |

A `1` value in the flags field tells QuickTime VR 2.2 that the frames are not rotated. QuickTime VR 2.2 treats this as a four-frame horizontal cylinder. The `panoType` field (formerly `reserved1`) must be set to `kQTVRCube` (`'cube'`) so that QuickTime VR 3.0 can recognize this panorama as a cube.

Since certain viewing fields in the pano sample data atom are being used for backward compatibility, a new atom must be added to indicate the proper viewing parameters for the cubic image. This atom is the cubic view atom (atom type `'cuvw'`). The data structure of the cubic view atom is as follows:

```c
struct QTVRCubicViewAtom {
    Float32         minPan;
    Float32         maxPan;
    Float32         minTilt;
    Float32         maxTilt;
    Float32         minFieldOfView;
    Float32         maxFieldOfView;
 
    Float32         defaultPan;
    Float32         defaultTilt;
    Float32         defaultFieldOfView;
};
typedef struct QTVRCubicViewAtom    QTVRCubicViewAtom;
```

The fields are filled in as desired for the cubic image. This atom is ignored by older versions of QuickTime VR. Typical minimum and maximum field values are shown in the following table.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `minPan` | `0.0` |
| `maxPan` | `360.0` |
| `minTilt` | `-90.0` |
| `maxTilt` | `90.0` |
| `minFieldOfView` | `5.0` |
| `maxFieldOfView` | `120.0` |

You add the cubic view atom to the pano sample atom container (after adding the pano sample data atom). Then use `AddMediaSample` to add the atom container to the panorama track.
