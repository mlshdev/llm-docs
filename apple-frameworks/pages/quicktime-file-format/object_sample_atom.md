## Overview

An object sample atom describes a single object, including information about the default viewing angles and the view settings. The structure of an object sample atom is defined by the `QTVRObjectSampleAtom` data type:

```c
typedef struct VRObjectSampleAtom {
    UInt16                              majorVersion;
    UInt16                              minorVersion;
    UInt16                              movieType;
    UInt16                              viewStateCount;
    UInt16                              defaultViewState;
    UInt16                              mouseDownViewState;
    UInt32                              viewDuration;
    UInt32                              columns;
    UInt32                              rows;
    Float32                             mouseMotionScale;
    Float32                             minPan;
    Float32                             maxPan;
    Float32                             defaultPan;
    Float32                             minTilt;
    Float32                             maxTilt;
    Float32                             defaultTilt;
    Float32                             minFieldOfView;

    Float32                             defaultViewCenterH;
    Float32                             defaultViewCenterV;
    Float32                             viewRate;
    Float32                             frameRate;
    UInt32                              animationSettings;
    UInt32                              controlSettings;
