A table containing the sample size information.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

The sample size table contains an entry for every sample in the media’s data stream. Each table entry contains a size field. The size field contains the size, in bytes, of the sample in question. The table is indexed by sample number — the first entry corresponds to the first sample, the second entry is for the second sample, and so on.

An example of a sample size table is as follows.

| Sample size | Sample |
| --- | --- |
| Size | Sample 1 |
| Size | Sample 2 |
| Size | Sample 3 |
| Size | Sample 4 |
| Size | Sample 5 |
