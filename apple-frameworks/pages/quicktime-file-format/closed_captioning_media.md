## Overview

A closed caption media track contains text data used for closed captioning in QuickTime movies. It has a media type of `'clcp'`. Closed captions are used to display the audio portions of a movie as text. They transcribe dialog and indicate other sounds.

Other tracks can identify this track as being a related closed captioning track by using the `'clcp'` track reference to refer to this track.

Like other media data tracks, a closed caption track should include a language code and an extended language tag atom.
