# gss_aapl_initial_cred(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** GSS  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** iOS 5.0+ · iPadOS 5.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.7+ · visionOS 1.0+

Acquires a new credential using a password or certificate.

## Declaration

```swift
func gss_aapl_initial_cred(_ desired_name: gss_name_t, _ desired_mech: gss_const_OID, _ attributes: CFDictionary?, _ output_cred_handle: UnsafeMutablePointer<gss_cred_id_t?>, _ error: UnsafeMutablePointer<Unmanaged<CFError>?>?) -> OM_uint32
```

## Parameters

- `desired_name`: The name to use to acquire the credential. Import the name using [gss_import_name(\_:\_:\_:\_:)](gss_import_name%28________%29.md). Ensure that the mechanism specified by the `desired_mech` parameter supports the name type.
- `desired_mech`: The mechanism to use to acquire the credential, for example [GSS_KRB5_MECHANISM](gss_krb5_mechanism.md) or [GSS_NTLM_MECHANISM](gss_ntlm_mechanism.md). Use [gss_indicate_mechs(\_:\_:)](gss_indicate_mechs%28____%29.md) to get a complete list of supported mechanisms.
- `attributes`: A dictionary that includes either the key [kGSSICPassword](kgssicpassword.md) to specify a password or [kGSSICCertificate](kgssiccertificate.md) to name a certificate for use in acquiring the credential. It may also contain any of the other keys listed in Initial Credential Keys in [Credential Management](credential-management.md) to optionally condition the operation.
- `output_cred_handle`: A credential pointer that the function sets to point at the new credential on success, or sets to [GSS_C_NO_CREDENTIAL](gss_c_no_credential.md) on failure. Use [gss_release_cred(\_:\_:)](gss_release_cred%28____%29.md) or [gss_destroy_cred(\_:\_:)](gss_destroy_cred%28____%29.md) to release the credential’s memory when you are done with it.
- `error`: An error pointer that the function sets to point at a new error object if the function call fails. Pass `NULL` to ignore this error. When an error does exist, it describes the reason for the failure, and you are responsible for releasing it with `CFRelease`.

## Return Value

A status code set to [GSS_S_COMPLETE](gss_s_complete.md) if the call succeeds, or some other value indicating the reason for failure if not.
