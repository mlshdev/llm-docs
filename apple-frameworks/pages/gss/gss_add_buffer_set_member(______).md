# gss_add_buffer_set_member(\_:\_:\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** GSS  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** iOS 5.0+ · iPadOS 5.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.7+ · visionOS 1.0+

Copies the contents of a buffer into a buffer set.

## Declaration

```swift
func gss_add_buffer_set_member(_ minor_status: UnsafeMutablePointer<OM_uint32>, _ member_buffer: gss_buffer_t, _ buffer_set: UnsafeMutablePointer<gss_buffer_set_t>) -> OM_uint32
```

## Parameters

- `minor_status`: A pointer to the secondary status result that provides additional information in case of failure. Typically, a failure results from an inability to allocate memory, communicated with minor status [ENOMEM](../foundation/posixerror/enomem.md).
- `member_buffer`: The buffer to copy into the buffer set.
- `buffer_set`: A pointer to a buffer set descriptor reference that receives a copy of the buffer. You can indicate that the buffer set doesn’t yet exist by setting its reference to [GSS_C_NO_BUFFER_SET](gss_c_no_buffer_set.md). In this case, the function creates it first using [gss_create_empty_buffer_set(\_:\_:)](gss_create_empty_buffer_set%28____%29.md). In any case, the buffer is added to the end of the set, and the buffer set’s `count` parameter incremented.

## Return Value

A status code set to [GSS_S_COMPLETE](gss_s_complete.md) on success, or [GSS_S_FAILURE](gss_s_failure.md) otherwise. Inspect the `minor_status` parameter for additional information on failure.

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

The function does not add the `member_buffer` to the buffer set directly. Rather it allocates new memory for a copy of the buffer, which it includes in the buffer set. When you call [gss_release_buffer_set(\_:\_:)](gss_release_buffer_set%28____%29.md) later, you deallocate the memory for the buffer set and all of its buffer copies, but this has no effect on the original `member_buffer`.

### Allocation and Deallocation

- [gss_create_empty_buffer_set(\_:\_:)](gss_create_empty_buffer_set%28____%29.md): Allocates an empty buffer set descriptor that you use to manage an array of buffers.
- [gss_release_buffer(\_:\_:)](gss_release_buffer%28____%29.md): Frees the memory associated with a single buffer descriptor.
- [gss_release_buffer_set(\_:\_:)](gss_release_buffer_set%28____%29.md): Frees the memory associated with a buffer set descriptor and all the buffers it contains.
