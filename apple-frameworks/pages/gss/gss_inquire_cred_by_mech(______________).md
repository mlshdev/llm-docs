# gss_inquire_cred_by_mech(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** GSS  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** iOS 5.0+ · iPadOS 5.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.7+ · visionOS 1.0+

Obtains per-mechanism information about a credential.

## Declaration

```swift
func gss_inquire_cred_by_mech(_ minor_status: UnsafeMutablePointer<OM_uint32>, _ cred_handle: gss_cred_id_t?, _ mech_type: gss_OID, _ cred_name: UnsafeMutablePointer<gss_name_t?>?, _ initiator_lifetime: UnsafeMutablePointer<OM_uint32>?, _ acceptor_lifetime: UnsafeMutablePointer<OM_uint32>?, _ cred_usage: UnsafeMutablePointer<gss_cred_usage_t>?) -> OM_uint32
```

## Parameters

- `minor_status`: A pointer to the secondary status result that provides additional information in case of failure.
- `cred_handle`: The credential to inspect. Use [GSS_C_NO_CREDENTIAL](gss_c_no_credential.md) to inquire about the default initiator principal.
- `mech_type`: The mechanism for which information should be returned.
- `cred_name`: A pointer the function uses to return the name that the credential asserts. Use [gss_release_name(\_:\_:)](gss_release_name%28____%29.md) to free the name  object’s memory when you are done with it. Set the parameter to `NULL` to ignore this output.
- `initiator_lifetime`: A pointer the function uses to return the number of seconds for which the credential will remain valid for initiating security contexts, or 0 if the credential is expired or if the credential’s usage mechanism is [GSS_C_ACCEPT](gss_c_accept.md). For credentials that do not support expiry, the function returns [GSS_C_INDEFINITE](gss_c_indefinite.md). Set to `NULL` to ignore this output.
- `acceptor_lifetime`: A pointer the function uses to return the number of seconds for which the credential will remain valid for accepting security contexts, or 0 if the credential is expired or if the credential’s usage mechanism is [GSS_C_INITIATE](gss_c_initiate.md). For credentials that do not support expiry, the function returns [GSS_C_INDEFINITE](gss_c_indefinite.md). Set to `NULL` to ignore this output.
- `cred_usage`: A pointer the function uses to return the credential usage. The value is one of [GSS_C_ACCEPT](gss_c_accept.md), [GSS_C_INITIATE](gss_c_initiate.md), or [GSS_C_BOTH](gss_c_both.md). Set to `NULL` to ignore this output.

## Return Value

A status code set to [GSS_S_COMPLETE](gss_s_complete.md) on success. See [Function Status](function-status.md) for a description of other status outputs.
