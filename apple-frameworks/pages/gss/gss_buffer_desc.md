# gss_buffer_desc (Swift)

**Framework:** GSS  
**Kind:** Type Alias  
**Availability:** iOS 5.0+ · iPadOS 5.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.14+ · visionOS 1.0+

The buffer descriptor that you use to exchange octet streams with many GSS-API functions.

## Declaration

```swift
typealias gss_buffer_desc = gss_buffer_desc_struct
```

## Topics

### Instance Properties

- [length](gss_buffer_desc_struct/length.md): The number of bytes held in the buffer.
- [value](gss_buffer_desc_struct/value.md): A pointer to the bytes in the buffer.
