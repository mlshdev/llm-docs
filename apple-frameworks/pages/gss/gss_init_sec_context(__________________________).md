# gss_init_sec_context(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** GSS  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** iOS 5.0+ · iPadOS 5.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.7+ · visionOS 1.0+

Initiates a security context with a peer.

## Declaration

```swift
func gss_init_sec_context(_ minor_status: UnsafeMutablePointer<OM_uint32>, _ initiator_cred_handle: gss_cred_id_t?, _ context_handle: UnsafeMutablePointer<gss_ctx_id_t?>, _ target_name: gss_name_t, _ input_mech_type: gss_OID?, _ req_flags: OM_uint32, _ time_req: OM_uint32, _ input_chan_bindings: gss_channel_bindings_t?, _ input_token: gss_buffer_t?, _ actual_mech_type: UnsafeMutablePointer<gss_OID?>?, _ output_token: gss_buffer_t, _ ret_flags: UnsafeMutablePointer<OM_uint32>?, _ time_rec: UnsafeMutablePointer<OM_uint32>?) -> OM_uint32
```

## Parameters

- `minor_status`: A pointer to the secondary status result that provides additional information in case of failure.
- `initiator_cred_handle`: The credential to use when building the context. Pass [GSS_C_NO_CREDENTIAL](gss_c_no_credential.md) to use the default credential for the mechanism.
- `context_handle`: A pointer the function uses to return the context. Pass [GSS_C_NO_CONTEXT](gss_c_no_context.md) for first call and use the value returned by the first call in continuation calls. Release the context’s resources using the  [gss_delete_sec_context(\_:\_:\_:)](gss_delete_sec_context%28______%29.md) function when you are done with it.
- `target_name`: The name of the target acceptor, created with [gss_import_name(\_:\_:\_:\_:)](gss_import_name%28________%29.md). The name must be of a type that is supported by the mechanism, as given by [gss_inquire_names_for_mech(\_:\_:\_:)](gss_inquire_names_for_mech%28______%29.md).
- `input_mech_type`: The mechanism type to use. Pass [GSS_C_NO_OID](gss_c_no_oid.md) to try Kerberos ([GSS_KRB5_MECHANISM](gss_krb5_mechanism.md)) as a default.
- `req_flags`: Logical OR of the flags to use when building the context. See [Context Services](context-services.md) for a list of possible values.
- `time_req`: The time in seconds that the context should be valid. Use [GSS_C_INDEFINITE](gss_c_indefinite.md) to request the longest available time.
- `input_chan_bindings`: Channel bindings to use. Pass [GSS_C_NO_CHANNEL_BINDINGS](gss_c_no_channel_bindings.md) if channel bindings are not used.
- `input_token`: A token sent from the acceptor. On the first call, use [GSS_C_NO_BUFFER](gss_c_no_buffer.md).
- `actual_mech_type`: A pointer the function uses to return the actual mechanism used by the context. Do *not* free this object because it is held in static memory.
- `output_token`: A buffer the function fills with an opaque token that you send to the acceptor. If the length of the buffer is non-zero, a token exists and you send it to the acceptor no matter the return status, whether complete, continue, or any error condition.
- `ret_flags`: A pointer the function uses to return the actual flags supported by the context. See [Context Services](context-services.md) for a list of possible values.
- `time_rec`: A pointer the function uses to return the actual number of seconds for which the context is valid. Pass `NULL` to ignore this output.

## Return Value

A status code indicating the outcome of the call. A code of [GSS_S_COMPLETE](gss_s_complete.md) means the context is complete. A code of [GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED](gss_s_continue_needed.md) indicates the need for another round of calls. Any other return code represents an error condition. See [Function Status](function-status.md) for a complete list of possible status results.
