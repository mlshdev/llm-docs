# File Provider (Swift)

**Framework:** File Provider  
**Kind:** Framework  
**Availability:** iOS 11.0+ · iPadOS 11.0+ · Mac Catalyst 11.0+ · macOS 10.15+ · visionOS 1.0+

An extension other apps use to access files and folders managed by your app and synced with a remote storage.

## Overview

If your app focuses on providing and syncing user documents from remote storage, you can implement a File Provider extension to give users access to those documents when they’re using other apps. If you just need to share local documents, see [Share files locally](fileprovider.md#Share-files-locally) below.

The File Provider extension syncs updates with the remote server.](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.fileprovider/media-4032695@2x.png)

The framework has two different starting points for building your File Provider extension.

- **[NSFileProviderReplicatedExtension](fileprovider/nsfileproviderreplicatedextension.md)**: The system manages the content accessed through the File Provider extension. Available in macOS 11+ and iOS 16+.
- **[NSFileProviderExtension](fileprovider/nsfileproviderextension.md)**: The extension hosts and manages the files accessed through the File Provider extension. Available in iOS 11+.

The replicated extension takes responsibility for monitoring and managing the local copies of your documents. The file provider focuses on syncing data between the local copy and the remote storage—uploading any local changes and downloading any remote changes. For more information, see [Replicated File Provider extension](fileprovider/replicated-file-provider-extension.md).

The nonreplicated extension manages a local copy of the extension’s content, including creating and managing placeholders for remote files. It also syncs the content with your remote storage. For more information, see [Nonreplicated File Provider extension](fileprovider/nonreplicated-file-provider-extension.md).

### Share files locally

You don’t need a File Provider extension to allow access to documents that your app stores locally.

In iOS, to give other apps access to the files in your `Documents` directory, set the following keys in your app’s Info tab or its `Info.plist` file. For document browser-based apps, set the [UISupportsDocumentBrowser](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/iPhoneOSKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009252-SW37) key. For all other apps, set both the [UIFileSharingEnabled](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/iPhoneOSKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009252-SW20) and [LSSupportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/LaunchServicesKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/plist/info/LSSupportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace) keys.

After you set these keys, other apps can open and edit the contents of your `Documents` directory in place. Your files also appear in both the Files app and the document browser. For more information, see the [UIDocumentBrowserViewController](uikit/uidocumentbrowserviewcontroller.md) class.

### Variables

- [NSFileProviderUserInfoExperimentIDKey](fileprovider/nsfileprovideruserinfokey/experimentid.md): System interpreted user info key When setting a value to that user info on a domain, the system will ingest this value. If user has given their consent for telemetry, this value will be used to decorate telemetry messages sent by the FileProvider subsystem. The telemetry messages can be then later on retrieved by developers along with the other metrics through the CloudKit console as detailed here: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/fileprovider/exporting-file-provider-metrics-data?language=objc This will help developers triaging data they receive from testing population compared to regular users The value must either be a NSNumber between \[0 - 31\]. If it’s not in that range, or if it is not a NSNumber, any call to addDomain with that invalid UserInfo dictionary will fail with a EINVAL POSIX NSError. To update this value, the provider must call addDomain with an updated userInfo dictionary
