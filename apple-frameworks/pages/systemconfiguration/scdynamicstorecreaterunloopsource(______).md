# SCDynamicStoreCreateRunLoopSource(\_:\_:\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** System Configuration  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** macOS 10.1+

Creates a run loop source object that can be added to the application’s run loop.

## Declaration

```swift
func SCDynamicStoreCreateRunLoopSource(_ allocator: CFAllocator?, _ store: SCDynamicStore, _ order: CFIndex) -> CFRunLoopSource?
```

## Parameters

- `allocator`: The allocator that should be used to allocate memory for the run loop source. This parameter may be `NULL` in which case the current default allocator is used. If this value is not a valid [CFAllocator](../corefoundation/cfallocator.md), the behavior is undefined.
- `store`: The dynamic store session.
- `order`: The order in which the sources that are ready to be processed are handled, on platforms that support it and for source versions that support it. A source with a lower order number is processed before a source with a higher order number. It is inadvisable to depend on the order number for any architectural or design aspect of code. In the absence of any reason to do otherwise, pass `0` for this parameter.

## Return Value

The new run loop source object. You must release the returned value.

## Discussion

Note that all dynamic store notifications are delivered using the run loop source this function returns.

# SCDynamicStoreCreateRunLoopSource (Objective-C)

**Framework:** System Configuration

## Parameters

- `allocator`: The allocator that should be used to allocate memory for the run loop source. This parameter may be `NULL` in which case the current default allocator is used. If this value is not a valid [CFAllocatorRef](../corefoundation/cfallocator.md), the behavior is undefined.
