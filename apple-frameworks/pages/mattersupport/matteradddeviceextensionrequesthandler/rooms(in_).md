# rooms(in:)

**Framework:** MatterSupport  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 16.1+ · iPadOS 16.1+ · Mac Catalyst 16.1+ · macOS 14.0+ · visionOS

Provides rooms that correspond to a home in the device setup.

## Declaration

```swift
func rooms(in home: MatterAddDeviceRequest.Home?) async -> [MatterAddDeviceRequest.Room]
```

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

The list of rooms to show. If only one room exists, no room card appears.

<a id="discussion"></a>

## Discussion

The system issues this request before presenting the “Select Room” card, and populates the picker with these options.

If the returned array contains two or more rooms, the user-interface flow displays a picker to allow selection of a room. If the object contains one room, that room is the selected room and the user-interface flow doesn’t display a picker. If the object contains no room, then the user-interface flow doesn’t display a picker, and any methods that take a room parameter receive `nil`.
