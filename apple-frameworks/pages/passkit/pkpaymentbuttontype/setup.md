![A button with the text “Set up” and the Apple Pay logo.](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.passkit/media-2903982@2x.png)

You can display this button when the device and parental controls support Apple Pay but the user has not yet added a card. Use the [PKPaymentAuthorizationViewController](../pkpaymentauthorizationviewcontroller.md) class’s [canMakePayments()](../pkpaymentauthorizationviewcontroller/canmakepayments%28%29.md) method to determine whether the device supports Apple Pay. If [canMakePayments()](../pkpaymentauthorizationviewcontroller/canmakepayments%28%29.md) returns [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true), call [canMakePayments(usingNetworks:capabilities:)](../pkpaymentauthorizationviewcontroller/canmakepayments%28usingnetworks_capabilities_%29.md) to determine whether the user has added any cards.

As soon as the user taps this button, initiate the process of setting up a new card (for example, by calling the [openPaymentSetup()](../pkpasslibrary/openpaymentsetup%28%29.md) method).
