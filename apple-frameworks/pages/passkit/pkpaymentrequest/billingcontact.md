If you have an up-to-date billing address on file, you can set it here. This billing address appears in the payment sheet. The user can either use the address you specify or select a different address.

Note that a [PKContact](../pkcontact.md) object that represents a billing contact contains information for only the [postalAddress](../pkcontact/postaladdress.md) property. All other properties in the object are set to `nil`.
