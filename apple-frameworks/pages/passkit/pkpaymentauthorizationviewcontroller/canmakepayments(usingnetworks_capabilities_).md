# canMakePayments(usingNetworks:capabilities:) (Swift)

**Framework:** PassKit (Apple Pay and Wallet)

**Availability:** iOS 9.0+ · iPadOS 9.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 11.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

Returns whether the user can make payments using a card from the specified network with the specified capabilities.

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated class func canMakePayments(usingNetworks supportedNetworks: [PKPaymentNetwork], capabilities capabilties: PKMerchantCapability) -> Bool
```

## Parameters

- `supportedNetworks`: An array of payment networks, as listed in Payment Networks.
- `capabilties`: A bitmask of capability values. For a list of possible values, see [PKPaymentMethodType](../pkpaymentmethodtype.md).

## Return Value

[true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true), if the device supports Apple Pay and the user has added a compatible card; otherwise, NO.

## Discussion

Use this method to see whether the user can make payments using a card from one of the selected networks (for example, American Express, Discover, Mastercard, Visa, etc.) with the selected capabilities (for example, credit, debit, etc.).

> **Note**

>  The earliest cards added to Apple Pay may not have credit or debit information. The API for distinguishing credit cards from debit cards is intended for European markets, where merchants often charge different rates for credit and debit purchases.
