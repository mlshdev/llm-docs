# PHASEOccluder (Swift)

**Framework:** PHASE  
**Kind:** Class  
**Availability:** iOS 15.0+ · iPadOS 15.0+ · Mac Catalyst 15.0+ · macOS 12.0+ · tvOS 17.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

An object with a shape and position that blocks audio from reaching the listener.

## Declaration

```swift
class PHASEOccluder
```

## Mentioned In

- [Playing sound from a location in a 3D scene](playing-sound-from-a-location-in-a-3d-scene.md)

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

The framework lowers the volume of an audio signal when an instance of this class positions somewhere along the path between the sound source and the listener.

For an example that demonstrates sound occlusion, see [Playing sound from a location in a 3D scene](playing-sound-from-a-location-in-a-3d-scene.md).

## Topics

### Creating an Occluder

- [init(engine:shapes:)](phaseoccluder/init%28engine_shapes_%29.md): Creates an occluder with the given engine and shapes.

### Inspecting the Shape

- [shapes](phaseoccluder/shapes.md): An array of shapes that collectively define the occluder’s audio-deflecting surface and texture.

## Relationships
