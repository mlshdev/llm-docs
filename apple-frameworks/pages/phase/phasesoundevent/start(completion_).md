# start(completion:) (Swift)

**Framework:** PHASE  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 15.0+ · iPadOS 15.0+ · Mac Catalyst 15.0+ · macOS 12.0+ · tvOS 17.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

Invokes the sound event and runs the specified code on completion.

## Declaration

```swift
func start(completion handler: (@Sendable (PHASESoundEvent.StartHandlerReason) -> Void)? = nil)
```

```swift
func start() async -> PHASESoundEvent.StartHandlerReason
```

> **Important**

>  You can call this method from synchronous code using a completion handler, as shown on this page, or you can call it as an asynchronous method that has the following declaration:

This function returns immediately after instructing the engine to invoke the sound event. If a problem occurs, the function provides an error.

The sound event’s audio plays immediately if the app prepares the sound event in advance. Otherwise, the sound event begins preparing and then plays after preparation completes.

When the sound event plays or errors out, the framework invokes `completionHandler`, passing in a [PHASESoundEvent.StartHandlerReason](starthandlerreason.md) that explains the reason for the invocation.

> **Important**

>  To play the same sound asset again, create another sound event object. After the first [start(completion:)](start%28completion_%29.md) call on a particular `PHASESoundEvent` instance, subsequent calls have no effect.
