# update() (Swift)

**Framework:** PHASE  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 15.0+ · iPadOS 15.0+ · Mac Catalyst 15.0+ · macOS 12.0+ · tvOS 17.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

Processes app commands and increments framework processing.

## Declaration

```swift
func update()
```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

This function consumes the app’s API calls since the last [update()](update%28%29.md), adjusts internal systems, objects, increments parameters, and invokes the app’s queued callbacks. An API call may require several [update()](update%28%29.md) invocations before the output device reflects the call’s results.

The framework ignores calls to this function for engines with `updateMode` set to [PHASEEngine.UpdateMode.automatic](updatemode/automatic.md); for more more information, see [init(updateMode:)](init%28updatemode_%29.md).

> **Note**

>  The frequency that the app calls this function doesn’t change the speed by which PHASE plays audio in real time.

### Update an Engine Manually

On an engine configured for manual updates ([PHASEEngine.UpdateMode.manual](updatemode/manual.md)), call this function periodically to instruct the framework to process API calls and perform internal updates. Call [update()](update%28%29.md) at a rate that matches your app’s visuals or logic update rate for optimal performance:

- Apps that process graphics at 60 FPS can invoke [update()](update%28%29.md) in their display link callback.
- Rates in the range of 240Hz to 30Hz offer equivalent audio performance, however apps that actively change the parameters of playing audio achieve smoother interpolation at a higher rate.
- If a game skips frames due to long running graphics routines, an app can throttle [update()](update%28%29.md) calls to values less than 30Hz without affecting audio quality as long as the system isn’t overloaded.

This function offers thread safety for apps that intend to call [update()](update%28%29.md) off of the main thread.
