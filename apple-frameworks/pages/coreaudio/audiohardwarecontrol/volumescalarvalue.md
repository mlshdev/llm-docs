## Discussion

Note that the set of all Float values between 0.0 and 1.0 inclusive is much larger than the set of actual values that the hardware can select. This means that the Float range has a many to one mapping with the underlying hardware values. As such, setting a scalar value will result in the control taking on the value nearest to what was set.
