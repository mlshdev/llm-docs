# copyDescription (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Foundation  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS · iPadOS · Mac Catalyst · macOS · tvOS · visionOS · watchOS

A prototype for a function callback that provides a description of the data pointed to by the `info` field. In implementing this function, return a reference to a CFString object that describes your allocator, particularly some characteristics of your program-defined data. You may set this function pointer to `NULL`, in which case Core Foundation will provide a rudimentary description.

## Declaration

```swift
var copyDescription: CFAllocatorCopyDescriptionCallBack!
```
