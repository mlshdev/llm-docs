# CFBinaryHeapGetMinimum(\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Foundation  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** iOS · iPadOS · Mac Catalyst · macOS · tvOS · visionOS · watchOS

Returns the minimum value in a binary heap.

## Declaration

```swift
func CFBinaryHeapGetMinimum(_ heap: CFBinaryHeap!) -> UnsafeRawPointer!
```

## Parameters

- `heap`: The binary heap to use.

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

The minimum value in `heap` as determined by the binary heap’s compare callback. If `heap` contains several equal minimum values, any one may be returned. If the value is a Core Foundation object, ownership follows the [The Get Rule](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/CoreFoundation/Conceptual/CFMemoryMgmt/Concepts/Ownership.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001148-SW1).
