# CFStringInsert(\_:\_:\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Foundation  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** iOS · iPadOS · Mac Catalyst · macOS · tvOS · visionOS · watchOS

Inserts a string at a specified location in the character buffer of a CFMutableString object.

## Declaration

```swift
func CFStringInsert(_ str: CFMutableString!, _ idx: CFIndex, _ insertedStr: CFString!)
```

## Parameters

- `str`: The string to be modified. If this value is not a CFMutableString object, an assertion is raised.
- `idx`: The index of the character in `str` after which the new characters are to be inserted. If the index is out of bounds, an assertion is raised.
- `insertedStr`: The string to insert into `str`.

## Discussion

To accommodate the new characters, this function moves any existing characters to the right of the inserted characters the appropriate number of positions.
