# CFStringGetPascalString(\_:\_:\_:\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Foundation  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** iOS · iPadOS · Mac Catalyst · macOS · tvOS · visionOS · watchOS

Copies the character contents of a CFString object to a local Pascal string buffer after converting the characters to a requested encoding.

## Declaration

```swift
func CFStringGetPascalString(_ theString: CFString!, _ buffer: StringPtr!, _ bufferSize: CFIndex, _ encoding: CFStringEncoding) -> Bool
```

## Parameters

- `theString`: The string to examine.
- `buffer`: The Pascal string buffer into which to copy the `theString`. The buffer must be at least `bufferSize` bytes in length. On return, contains the converted characters. If there is an error in conversion, the buffer contains only partial results.
- `bufferSize`: The length of the local `buffer` in bytes (accounting for the length byte).
- `encoding`: The string encoding to which the character contents of `theString` should be converted.

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

`true` if the operation succeeds or `false` if the conversion fails or the provided buffer is too small.

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

This function is useful when you need your own copy of a CFString object’s character data as a Pascal string. You can also call it as a “backup” operation when a prior call to the [CFStringGetPascalStringPtr(\_:\_:)](cfstringgetpascalstringptr%28____%29.md) function fails.
