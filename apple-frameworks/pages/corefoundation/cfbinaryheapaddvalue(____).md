# CFBinaryHeapAddValue(\_:\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Foundation  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** iOS · iPadOS · Mac Catalyst · macOS · tvOS · visionOS · watchOS

Adds a value to a binary heap.

## Declaration

```swift
func CFBinaryHeapAddValue(_ heap: CFBinaryHeap!, _ value: UnsafeRawPointer!)
```

## Parameters

- `heap`: The binary heap to use.
- `value`: The value to add to the binary heap. The value is retained by the binary heap using the retain callback provided in the [CFBinaryHeapCallBacks](cfbinaryheapcallbacks.md) structure when the binary heap was created.
