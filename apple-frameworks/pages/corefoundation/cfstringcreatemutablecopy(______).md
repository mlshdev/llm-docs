# CFStringCreateMutableCopy(\_:\_:\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Foundation  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** iOS · iPadOS · Mac Catalyst · macOS · tvOS · visionOS · watchOS

Creates a mutable copy of a string.

## Declaration

```swift
func CFStringCreateMutableCopy(_ alloc: CFAllocator!, _ maxLength: CFIndex, _ theString: CFString!) -> CFMutableString!
```

## Parameters

- `alloc`: The allocator to use to allocate memory for the new string. Pass `NULL` or kCFAllocatorDefault to use the current default allocator.
- `maxLength`: The maximum number of Unicode characters that can be stored by the returned object. Pass `0` if there should be no character limit. Note that initially the returned object still has the same length as the string argument; this parameter simply specifies what the maximum size is. CFString might try to optimize its internal storage by paying attention to this value.
- `theString`: A string to copy.

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

A string that has the same contents as `theString`. Returns `NULL` if there was a problem copying the object. Ownership follows the [The Create Rule](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/CoreFoundation/Conceptual/CFMemoryMgmt/Concepts/Ownership.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001148-103029).

## Discussion

The returned mutable string is identical to the original string except for (perhaps) the mutability attribute. You can add character data to the returned string with any of the `CFStringAppend...` functions, and you can insert, delete, replace, pad, and trim characters with the appropriate CFString functions. If the `maxLength` parameter is greater than `0`, any attempt to add characters beyond this limit results in a run-time error.
