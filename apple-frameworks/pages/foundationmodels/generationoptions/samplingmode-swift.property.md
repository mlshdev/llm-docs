# samplingMode

**Framework:** Foundation Models  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 26.0+ · iPadOS 26.0+ · Mac Catalyst 26.0+ · macOS 26.0+ · visionOS 26.0+ · watchOS 27.0+

A sampling strategy for how the model picks tokens when generating a response.

## Declaration

```swift
@backDeployed(before: iOS 27.0, macOS 27.0, visionOS 27.0)
var samplingMode: GenerationOptions.SamplingMode? { get set }
```

## Discussion

When you execute a prompt on a model, the model produces a probability for every token in its vocabulary. The sampling strategy controls how the model narrows down the list of tokens to consider during that process. A strategy that picks the single most likely token yields a predictable response every time, but other strategies offer results that often sound more natural to a person.

> **Note**

> Leaving the `sampling` to `nil` lets the system choose a reasonable default on your behalf.
