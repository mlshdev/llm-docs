A profile that contains dynamic instructions.

## Declaration

```swift
struct Profile
```

## Overview

A profile binds [DynamicInstructions](../dynamicinstructions.md) to a set of session-level configuration values. The [DynamicInstructions](../dynamicinstructions.md) describes the content and tools and a [LanguageModelSession.DynamicProfile](dynamicprofile.md) orchestrates transitions betwen session configurations.

```swift
Profile {
    // Custom instructions and tools for a creative task.
}
// Use a higher creative temperature value when a person likes poetry.
.temperature(likesPoetry ? 0.8 : 0.1)
// Perform deeper reasoning when a person likes astronomy.
.reasoningLevel(likesAstronomy ? .deep : .light)
```

A [LanguageModelSession.Profile](profile.md) conforms to [LanguageModelSession.DynamicProfile](dynamicprofile.md) and includes all the same modifiers that you use to configure a unit of work to perform. Observe and react to key moments during a session by using life cycle modifiers. When a profile and a subprofile both register a callback, the framework calls both. The following shows observing [onToolOutput(perform:)](dynamicprofile/ontooloutput%28perform_%29.md) to handle logging after a tool provides output:

```swift
Profile {
    // Custom instructions and tools for the task.
}
.onToolOutput { toolCall, output in
    // Runs after the tool to log any necessary activity.
}
```
