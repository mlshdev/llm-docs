## Discussion

This method can be useful in cases where you have a strong signal that the user will interact with session within a few seconds. For example, you might call `prewarm(promptPrefix:)` when a person begins typing into a text field.

If you know a prefix for the future prompt, passing it to `prewarm(promptPrefix:)` allows the system to process the prompt eagerly and reduce latency for the future request.

> **Important**

> You should only use prewarm when you have a window of at least 1 second before the call to a respond method, like [respond(to:options:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/languagemodelsession/respond%28to:options:%29-6a2gb) or [streamResponse(to:options:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/languagemodelsession/streamresponse%28to:options:%29-2nlni).

Calling this method doesn’t guarantee that the system loads your assets immediately, particularly if your app is running in the background or the system is under load.
