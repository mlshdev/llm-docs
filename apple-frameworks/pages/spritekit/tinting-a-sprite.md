# Tinting a Sprite

**Interface languages:** Swift, Objective-C

**Framework:** SpriteKit  
**Kind:** Article

Provide a color and blend factor to additively color your sprite.

## Overview

You can use the [color](skspritenode/color.md) and [colorBlendFactor](skspritenode/colorblendfactor.md) properties to colorize the texture applied to a sprite node. The color blend factor defaults to `0.0`, which indicates that the texture should be used unmodified. As you increase this number, more of the texture color is replaced with the blended color. For example, when a monster in your game takes damage, you might want to add a red tint to the character. The following code shows how you would apply a tint to the sprite.

**Swift**

```swift
monsterSprite.color = .red
monsterSprite.colorBlendFactor = 0.5
```

**Obj-C**

```objc
monsterSprite.color = [SKColor redColor];
monsterSprite.colorBlendFactor = 0.5;
```

You can also animate the color and color blend factors using actions. The following code shows how to briefly tint the sprite and then return it to normal.

**Swift**

```swift
let pulsedRed = SKAction.sequence([
    SKAction.colorize(with: .red, colorBlendFactor: 1.0, duration: 0.15),
    SKAction.wait(forDuration: 0.1),
    SKAction.colorize(withColorBlendFactor: 0.0, duration: 0.15)])
spaceship.run(pulsedRed)
```

**Obj-C**

```objc
SKAction *pulseRed = [SKAction sequence:@[
                        [SKAction colorizeWithColor:[SKColor redColor] colorBlendFactor:1.0 duration:0.15],
                        [SKAction waitForDuration:0.1],
                        [SKAction colorizeWithColorBlendFactor:0.0 duration:0.15]]];    
 
[monsterSprite runAction: pulseRed];
```
