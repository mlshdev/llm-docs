# Detecting Changes at Each Step of an Animation (Swift)

Get notified of a property change on your node subclass and retrieve the amount of change.

## Overview

Generally, actions do not call public methods on nodes. For example, if you want to subclass [SKNode](sknode.md) to respond to a [move(to:duration:)](skaction/move%28to_duration_%29.md) action, you might consider overriding its [position](sknode/position.md) property to add a `didSet` observer (see [Overriding Property Observers](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Inheritance.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH17-ID201)).

```swift
class MovingNode: SKSpriteNode {
    override var position: CGPoint {
        didSet {
            // code to react to position change
        }
    }
}
```

However, because a move action that’s running on an instance of `MovingNode` (defined in the code listing above) doesn’t set its position, the observer isn’t invoked and thus, your code is never executed.

In this case, the solution is to use [SKSceneDelegate](skscenedelegate.md) and compare the node’s position across two of its callbacks. You save the node’s initial position in [update(\_:for:)](skscenedelegate/update%28__for_%29.md), which is called at the beginning of each frame, then calculate any change in position in [didEvaluateActions(for:)](skscenedelegate/didevaluateactions%28for_%29.md), which is called after actions have been evaluated.

The following code demonstrates an example of this strategy:

```swift
let node = SKNode()
var nodePosition = CGPoint()
     
func update(_ currentTime: TimeInterval, for scene: SKScene) {
    nodePosition = node.position
}
     
func didEvaluateActions(for scene: SKScene) {
    let distance = hypot(node.position.x - nodePosition.x,
                         node.position.y - nodePosition.y)
    
    if distance > 0 {
        // code to react to position change
    }
}
```

## Overview

Generally, actions do not call public methods on nodes. For example, if you want to subclass [SKNode](sknode.md) to respond to a [moveTo:duration:](skaction/move%28to_duration_%29.md) action, you might consider overriding its [position](sknode/position.md) property to add a `didSet` observer (see [Overriding Property Observers](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Inheritance.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH17-ID201)).

```swift
class MovingNode: SKSpriteNode {
    override var position: CGPoint {
        didSet {
            // code to react to position change
        }
    }
}
```

However, because a move action that’s running on an instance of `MovingNode` (defined in the code listing above) doesn’t set its position, the observer isn’t invoked and thus, your code is never executed.

In this case, the solution is to use [SKSceneDelegate](skscenedelegate.md) and compare the node’s position across two of its callbacks. You save the node’s initial position in [update:forScene:](skscenedelegate/update%28__for_%29.md), which is called at the beginning of each frame, then calculate any change in position in [didEvaluateActionsForScene:](skscenedelegate/didevaluateactions%28for_%29.md), which is called after actions have been evaluated.

The following code demonstrates an example of this strategy:

```swift
let node = SKNode()
var nodePosition = CGPoint()
     
func update(_ currentTime: TimeInterval, for scene: SKScene) {
    nodePosition = node.position
}
     
func didEvaluateActions(for scene: SKScene) {
    let distance = hypot(node.position.x - nodePosition.x,
                         node.position.y - nodePosition.y)
    
    if distance > 0 {
        // code to react to position change
    }
}
```
