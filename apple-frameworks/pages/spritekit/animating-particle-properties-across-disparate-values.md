## Overview

An [SKKeyframeSequence](skkeyframesequence.md) object enables you to specify multiple values for an emitter node’s properties over a specific time period. The property values you choose may be arbitrary, which results in your ability to graph those property changes linearly or nonlinearly over time.

When you use a sequence, the values are not randomized. Instead, the sequence specifies all of the values of the property. Each keyframe value includes a value object and a timestamp. The timestamps are specified in a range from `0` to `1.0`, where `0` represents the birth of the particle and `1.0` represents its death.

The properties for which [SKEmitterNode](skemitternode.md) offers a keyframe sequence are:

| Property | Specifies | Example use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [particleColorSequence](skemitternode/particlecolorsequence.md) | A sequence of arbitrary colors a particle should reflect over its lifetime. | Embers from a fire might specify the color sequence (white, yellow, orange, and brown) to appear hot, and then cool. |
| [particleColorBlendFactorSequence](skemitternode/particlecolorblendfactorsequence.md) | A sequence of color blend factors a particle should apply over its lifetime. | Embers from a fire might specify the color blend factor sequence (0, 1, 0, 1, … etc.) to simulate flickering. |
| [particleScaleSequence](skemitternode/particlescalesequence.md) | A sequence of sizes of a particle over its lifetime. | Balloons might use the scale sequence (0.1, 1, 1, 1, 0.1) to simulate inflation, and flying for some time before deflating. |
| [particleAlphaSequence](skemitternode/particlealphasequence.md) | A sequence of levels of transparency a particle undergoes over its lifetime. | Fireflies might specify a disparate sequence of alpha values to simulate random lighting patterns as they travel. |

The following code demonstrates using [particleScaleSequence](skemitternode/particlescalesequence.md) to animate the scale of an emitter node’s particles over their lifetime. Initially, the particles’ scale is `0.2` and then increases to `0.7` one-quarter of the way through the sequence. Three-quarters of the way through the sequence, the scale reaches its minimum size, `0.1`. It remains at this size until it dies.

**Swift**

```swift
let scaleSequence = SKKeyframeSequence(keyframeValues: [0.2, 0.7, 0.1],
                                       times: [0.0, 0.250, 0.75])
myEmitter.particleScaleSequence = scaleSequence
```

**Obj-C**

```objc
SKKeyframeSequence  *scaleSequence = [[SKKeyframeSequence alloc] initWithKeyframeValues:@[@0.2,@0.7,@0.1] times:@[@0.0,@0.250,@0.75]];
myEmitter.particleScaleSequence = scaleSequence;
```
