# run(\_:completion:) (Swift)

**Framework:** SpriteKit  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS · iPadOS · Mac Catalyst · macOS · tvOS · visionOS · watchOS

Adds an action to the list of actions executed by the node and schedules the argument block to be run upon completion of the action.

## Declaration

```swift
func run(_ action: SKAction, completion block: @escaping () -> Void)
```

```swift
func run(_ action: SKAction) async
```

```swift
func run(_ action: SKAction, completion block: @escaping @Sendable () -> Void)
```

## Parameters

- `action`: The action to perform.
- `block`: A completion block called when the action completes.

### Running Actions

- [Getting Started with Actions](../getting-started-with-actions.md): Create, configure, and run actions in SpriteKit.
- [run(\_:)](run%28__%29.md): Adds an action to the list of actions executed by the node.
- [run(\_:withKey:)](run%28__withkey_%29.md): Adds an identifiable action to the list of actions executed by the node.
- [speed](speed.md): A speed modifier applied to all actions executed by a node and its descendants.
- [isPaused](ispaused.md): A Boolean value that determines whether actions on the node and its descendants are processed.
- [action(forKey:)](action%28forkey_%29.md): Returns an action associated with a specific key.
- [hasActions()](hasactions%28%29.md): Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the node is executing actions.
- [removeAllActions()](removeallactions%28%29.md): Ends and removes all actions from the node.
- [removeAction(forKey:)](removeaction%28forkey_%29.md): Removes an action associated with a specific key.
