# generatingNormalMap(withSmoothness:contrast:) (Swift)

**Framework:** SpriteKit  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ · iPadOS 8.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.10+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 1.0+

Creates a normal map texture by analyzing the contents of an existing texture.

## Declaration

```swift
func generatingNormalMap(withSmoothness smoothness: CGFloat, contrast: CGFloat) -> Self
```

## Parameters

- `smoothness`: A number between `0.0` and `1.0` indicating how much the texture should be smoothed before the normal map is generated. A value of `0.0` means that the texture is not smoothed at all before being processed.
- `contrast`: A value used to magnify the effect of the generated normal map. A value of `1.0` indicates no magnification is applied.

## Return Value

A new texture object that contains a normal map.

## Discussion

A normal map texture is similar to an image texture, but instead of holding image data to be displayed onscreen, every texel represents a normal vector. Normal map textures are used to simulate 3D lighting (see the [normalTexture](../skspritenode/normaltexture.md) property) or used to generate velocity values (see [velocityField(with:)](../skfieldnode/velocityfield%28with_%29.md)).

You can create normal maps in two different ways. First, you can take an existing image map and use it to generate a normal map. SpriteKit filters the color data in the texture and then uses it to generate a map based on pixel contrast. Alternatively, you can load a regular image file but treat it as a normal map. To do this, provide a texture with 32-bit `RGBx` pixel data. Each component’s 8-bit integer value is mapped to a floating point number between the values of `-1.0` and `1.0`. Use a `0` to represent `-1.0f`, a value of `127` to represent `0.0`, and a value of `255` to represent `+1.0`.

The image below shows two sprite nodes both with the same texture. The node on the right has a normal map from the same noise texture generated using the [generatingNormalMap()](generatingnormalmap%28%29.md) method.
