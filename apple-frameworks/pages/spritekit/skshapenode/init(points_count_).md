**Framework:** SpriteKit  
**Kind:** Initializer  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ · iPadOS 8.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.10+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 1.0+

Creates a shape node from a series of points.

## Declaration

```swift

```

## Parameters

- `points`: An array of Core Graphics points. The points are relative to the node’s origin.
- `numPoints`: The number of points in the array.
