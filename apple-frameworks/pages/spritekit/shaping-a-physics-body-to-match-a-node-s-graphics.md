# Shaping a Physics Body to Match a Node’s Graphics (Swift)

**Framework:** SpriteKit  
**Kind:** Article

Shape a physics body to your graphics for the right blend of collision accuracy and performance.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

In most cases, a physics body should have a size and shape that closely approximates the visual representation of the corresponding node. For example, the rocket shown below has a narrow shape that is not well represented by either a circle or a rectangle. A convex polygon shape is chosen and fitted to match the sprite’s artwork.

### Shape a Physics Body Using a Texture’s Alpha Channel

If you do not want to create your own shapes, you can use SpriteKit to create a shape for you based on the sprite’s texture.

**Swift**

```swift
let sprite = SKSpriteNode(imageNamed: "Spaceship")
sprite.physicsBody = SKPhysicsBody(texture: sprite.texture!,
                                   size: sprite.texture!.size())
```

**Obj-C**

```objc
SKSpriteNode *sprite = [SKSpriteNode spriteNodeWithImageNamed:@"Spaceship"];
sprite.physicsBody = [SKPhysicsBody bodyWithTexture:sprite.texture size:sprite.texture.size];
```

### Choose a Simple Geometric Physics Body Shape

When choosing a shape for your physics body, do not be overly precise. More complex shapes require more work to be properly simulated. For volume-based bodies, use the following guidelines:

- A circle is the most efficient shape ([init(circleOfRadius:)](skphysicsbody/init%28circleofradius_%29.md))
- A path-based polygon is the least efficient shape, and the computational work scales with the complexity of the polygon ([init(polygonFrom:)](skphysicsbody/init%28polygonfrom_%29.md))

### Use Edge-Based Physics Bodies Only When Needed

An edge-based body is more expensive to compute than a volume-based body. This is because the bodies it interacts with can potentially be on either side of an open edge or on the inside or outside of a closed shape. Use these guidelines:

- Lines and rectangles are the most efficient edge-based bodies ([init(edgeFrom:to:)](skphysicsbody/init%28edgefrom_to_%29.md) and [init(edgeLoopFrom:)](skphysicsbody/init%28edgeloopfrom_%29-8sqfy.md))
- Edge loops and edge chains are the most expensive edge-based bodies, and the computational work scales with the complexity of the path ([init(edgeLoopFrom:)](skphysicsbody/init%28edgeloopfrom_%29-5grxu.md) and [init(edgeChainFrom:)](skphysicsbody/init%28edgechainfrom_%29.md)).
