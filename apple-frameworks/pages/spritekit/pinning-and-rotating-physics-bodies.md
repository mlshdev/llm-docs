# Pinning and Rotating Physics Bodies

**Interface languages:** Swift, Objective-C

**Framework:** SpriteKit  
**Kind:** Article

Pin a node so it’s free to rotate about a certain point on its parent node.

## Overview

A common task in a physics simulation is to pin bodies together. Pinning locks the position of an object but allows it to rotate—for example, to fix a wheel to a vehicle. SpriteKit offers two options for pinning physics bodies—either using the [pinned](skphysicsbody/pinned.md) property or creating an [SKPhysicsJointPin](skphysicsjointpin.md) joint.

The [pinned](skphysicsbody/pinned.md) property offers convenience because it requires less code. If you wish to simulate friction, the physics body’s [angularDamping](skphysicsbody/angulardamping.md) property is analogous to the joint’s [frictionTorque](skphysicsjointpin/frictiontorque.md) property. You must use a joint, however, if you want to control the rotation speed. In addition, use a joint to control the anchor point or limit the rotation angles—you do that by using [lowerAngleLimit](skphysicsjointpin/loweranglelimit.md) and [upperAngleLimit](skphysicsjointpin/upperanglelimit.md).

### Pin a Node Using the Pinned Property

The following code demonstrates using the [pinned](skphysicsbody/pinned.md) property. The code creates a sprite node with an image of a pendulum (two circles of different sizes joined by a center rod). A physics body is created based on the generated texture, has its [pinned](skphysicsbody/pinned.md) property set to [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true), and is assigned to the node. The node is rotated 90 degrees—to align horizontally—so that gravity pulls the heavier end toward the ground.

```swift
let pinned = SKSpriteNode(imageNamed: "pendulum")
  
pinned.physicsBody = SKPhysicsBody(texture: pinned.texture!,
                                   size: pinned.size)
pinned.position = CGPoint(x: 320,
                          y: 320)
pinned.zRotation = CGFloat.pi / 2
pinned.physicsBody?.pinned = true
  
scene.addChild(pinned)
```

Because the node’s physics body is pinned, it stays in position but rotates around its center.

### Pin a Node Using a Joint

The following code demonstrates using a physics joint pin. In this example, a static anchor is created and added to the scene. The sprite node is added as a child of the anchor node and a [SKPhysicsJointPin](skphysicsjointpin.md) joins the two together.

```swift
let anchor = SKNode()
  
anchor.position = CGPoint(x: 320,
                          y: 320)
anchor.zRotation = CGFloat.pi / 2
anchor.physicsBody = SKPhysicsBody()
anchor.physicsBody?.isDynamic = false
  
let jointed = SKSpriteNode(imageNamed: "pendulum")
jointed.physicsBody = SKPhysicsBody(texture: pinned.texture!,
                                    size: pinned.size)
  
scene.addChild(anchor)
anchor.addChild(jointed)
  
let pinJoint = SKPhysicsJointPin.joint(withBodyA: anchor.physicsBody!,
                                       bodyB: jointed.physicsBody!,
                                       anchor: anchor.position)
scene.physicsWorld.add(pinJoint)
```
