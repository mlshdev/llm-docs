# contactTestBitMask (Swift)

**Framework:** SpriteKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS · iPadOS · Mac Catalyst · macOS · tvOS · visionOS · watchOS

A mask that defines which categories of physics bodies cause intersection notifications with this physics body.

## Declaration

```swift
var contactTestBitMask: UInt32 { get set }
```

## Discussion

When two bodies share the same space, each body’s category mask is tested against the other body’s contact mask by performing a logical AND operation. If either comparison results in a nonzero value, an [SKPhysicsContact](../skphysicscontact.md) object is created and passed to the physics world’s delegate. For best performance, only set bits in the contacts mask for interactions you are interested in.

The default value is `0x00000000` (all bits cleared).
