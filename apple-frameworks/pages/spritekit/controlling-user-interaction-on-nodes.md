# Controlling User Interaction on Nodes (Swift)

**Framework:** SpriteKit  
**Kind:** Article

Enable your node to respond to user input, like touches or mouse clicks.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

`SKNode` subclasses [UIResponder](../uikit/uiresponder.md) in iOS and tvOS, and [NSResponder](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsresponder) in macOS, allowing nodes to respond to user interaction events such as touches and mouse movements.

There are two strategies you can adopt when supporting user interaction.

- Enable user interaction on a single catch-all node, for example the scene, and calculate the child node or nodes that the user is interacting with by doing custom hit tests.
- Enable user interaction on every node you want the user to interact with, and subclass them to implement their responder functions.

<a id="Catch-All-User-Interaction-by-Using-a-Parent-Node"></a>

### Catch All User Interaction by Using a Parent Node

Listing 1 shows an example of how to handle all user interaction on a parent node–in this case, the scene itself. The `TouchScene` class subclasses [SKScene](skscene.md) and overrides its [isUserInteractionEnabled](sknode/isuserinteractionenabled.md) to return `true`.

Listing 1. A scene that responds to touches

```swift
class TouchScene: SKScene {
    override var isUserInteractionEnabled: Bool {
        get {
            return true
        }
        set {
            // ignore
        }
    }
    
    override func touchesBegan(_ touches: Set<UITouch>, with event: UIEvent?) {
        guard let touch = touches.first else {
            return
        }
        
        let location = touch.location(in: self)
        
        let touchedNodes = nodes(at: location)
        let frontTouchedNode = atPoint(location).name
    }
}
```

> **Note**

>  Alternatively, you could override [sceneDidLoad()](skscene/scenedidload%28%29.md) and set [isUserInteractionEnabled](sknode/isuserinteractionenabled.md) to `true` in your implementation.

The overridden [touchesBegan(\_:with:)](../uikit/uiresponder/touchesbegan%28__with_%29.md) method shows two techniques to find the nodes that have been touched. [nodes(at:)](sknode/nodes%28at_%29.md) returns an array of all of the sprites and [atPoint(\_:)](sknode/atpoint%28__%29.md) returns the top-most touched node.

In this example, the child nodes should have [isUserInteractionEnabled](sknode/isuserinteractionenabled.md) set to `false`. The parent scene is responsible for responding to user interactions.

Listing 2 shows the equivalent code for macOS.

Listing 2. A scene that responds to mouse down

```swift
class TouchScene: SKScene {
    override var isUserInteractionEnabled: Bool {
        get {
            return true
        }
        set {
            // ignore
        }
    }
    
    override func mouseDown(with event: NSEvent) {
        let location = event.location(in: self)
        let touchedNodes = nodes(at: location)
        let firstTouchedNode = atPoint(location).name
    }
}
```

### Enable User Interaction on All Nodes

Listing 3 shows an example of supporting user interaction on individual nodes in your scene. Instances of `TouchSpriteNode` are added as children of a standard scene and user interaction is handled by each independently.

In the case of overlapping nodes, only one will register a user interaction. For example, of two overlapping nodes, the one with the highest [zPosition](sknode/zposition.md) receives the touch. For two nodes with an equal `zPosition`, the last node in the parent’s [children](sknode/children.md) array receives the touch.

Listing 3. A sprite node that responds to touches

```swift
class TouchSpriteNode: SKSpriteNode {
    override var isUserInteractionEnabled: Bool {
        set {
            // ignore
        }
        get {
            return true
        }
    }
         
    // For macOS replace this method with `mouseDown(with:)`
    override func touchesBegan(_ touches: Set<UITouch>, with event: UIEvent?) {
        // User has touched this node
    }
}
```

<a id="Handle-User-Interaction-on-Hidden-Nodes-by-Using-Alpha"></a>

### Handle User Interaction on Hidden Nodes by Using Alpha

Translucent nodes–those with an [alpha](sknode/alpha.md) of less than `1` but greater than `0`–still receive user interactions. You can set a node’s `alpha` to [leastNonzeroMagnitude](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/float/leastnonzeromagnitude) to make it effectively transparent and yet still respond to touches or mouse movements, although giving it a color of `clear` has the same effect.

<a id="Review-the-Bounds-of-Node-User-Interaction"></a>

### Review the Bounds of Node User Interaction

User interaction is based on the bounding box of the node. Sprite nodes containing textures with transparent areas or shape nodes with non-rectangular shapes will still report touches and mouse interactions even if the interaction is over a transparent part of their content.

If you build a composite node, the region that receives user interaction events is dependent on the node tree. Listing 4 shows the code used to create a subclassed [SKNode](sknode.md) that renders six circular shape nodes forming a larger circle.

Listing 4. A composite node that responds to touches

```swift
class TouchCompositeNode: SKNode {
    override var isUserInteractionEnabled: Bool {
        set {
            // ignore
        }
        get {
            return true
        }
    }
    
    let tau = CGFloat.pi * 2
    
    required init(color: SKColor, radius: CGFloat = 100) {
        super.init()
        
        stride(from: 0, to: tau, by: tau / 6).forEach {
            
            let node = SKShapeNode(circleOfRadius: 20)
            
            node.fillColor = color
            node.position = CGPoint(x: sin($0) * radius,
                                    y: cos($0) * radius)
            
            addChild(node)
        }
    }
    
    required init?(coder aDecoder: NSCoder) {
        fatalError("init(coder:) has not been implemented")
    }
    
    // For macOS replace this method with `mouseDown(with:)`
    override func touchesBegan(_ touches: Set<UITouch>, with event: UIEvent?) {
        // User has touched this node
    }
}

```

If you were to add an instance of `TouchCompositeNode` to an [SKScene](skscene.md) with no other nodes behind it, all touches inside its [calculateAccumulatedFrame()](sknode/calculateaccumulatedframe%28%29.md) would be reported. The figure below shows the accumulated frame of `TouchCompositeNode`. Any user events within the dashed line will call [touchesBegan(\_:with:)](../uikit/uiresponder/touchesbegan%28__with_%29.md).

![Diagram showing how user events can be reported inside a node’s accumulated frame](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.spritekit/media-2985136@2x.png)

However, if you were to place an instance of `TouchCompositeNode` above another node using, for example, the code in Listing 5, only touches on its child nodes would be reported.

Listing 5. Placing a composite node over a background

```swift
let composite = TouchCompositeNode(color: .red)
composite.position = CGPoint(x: 400, y: 400)
     
let backgroundNode = SKSpriteNode(color: .blue,
                                  size: CGSize(width: 500, height: 500))
backgroundNode.position = CGPoint(x: 400, y: 400)
     
scene.addChild(backgroundNode)
scene.addChild(composite)
```

In this case, only touches or mouse events over the red spots shown in the figure below will call [touchesBegan(\_:with:)](../uikit/uiresponder/touchesbegan%28__with_%29.md).

![Diagram showing how events are reported over a node’s non-transparent content. ](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.spritekit/media-2985152@2x.png)

> **Important**

>  Nodes that have user interaction disabled will block touch and mouse events on nodes behind them where they overlap.
