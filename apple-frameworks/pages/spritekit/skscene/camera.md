# camera (Swift)

**Framework:** SpriteKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 9.0+ · iPadOS 9.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.11+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

The camera node in the scene that determines what part of the scene’s coordinate space is visible in the view.

## Declaration

```swift
weak var camera: SKCameraNode? { get set }
```

## Discussion

The default value of this property is `nil`, which means that the scene’s [anchorPoint](anchorpoint.md) and [size](size.md) properties determine what portion of the scene is visible. If set to point to a camera node contained in the scene, the [anchorPoint](anchorpoint.md) property is ignored and the scene is rendered using the camera node’s properties instead.

A camera must be added as a child of the scene for it to render that scene.

Listing 1 shows, in Swift, how to add a camera to an [SKScene](../skscene.md) named `scene`. The camera is positioned in the center of the scene which gives the same result as rendering a camera-less scene with an [anchorPoint](anchorpoint.md) of [zero](../../corefoundation/cgpoint/zero.md).

Listing 1. Adding a camera to a scene

```swift
let cameraNode = SKCameraNode()
    
cameraNode.position = CGPoint(x: scene.size.width / 2,
                              y: scene.size.height / 2)
    
scene.addChild(cameraNode)
scene.camera = cameraNode
```
