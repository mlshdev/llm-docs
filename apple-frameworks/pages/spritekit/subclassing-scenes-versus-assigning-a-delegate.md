# Subclassing Scenes Versus Assigning a Delegate

**Interface languages:** Swift, Objective-C

**Framework:** SpriteKit  
**Kind:** Article

Use a scene delegate to share app logic across various scenes.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Often, your app subclasses [SKScene](skscene.md) to deliver gameplay. Your subclass usually:

- Lays out initial scene content
- Defines app logic that runs every frame
- Implements responder methods to handle keyboard, mouse, or touch events

An alternative pattern is to assign a [delegate](skview/delegate.md) that handles [SKScene](skscene.md) instead. For example, if you make the view controller the delegate for your scene, it can use multiple scenes that share the same [SKSceneDelegate](skscenedelegate.md) implementations. The view controller participates in event handling and so it can respond to user input also.

> **Important**

>  On macOS, you need to set the window’s [nextResponder](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsresponder/nextresponder) to your app’s view controller because by default, the view is the first responder to user input events.
