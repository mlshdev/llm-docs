# setTexture(\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** SpriteKit  
**Kind:** Type Method  
**Availability:** iOS 7.1+ · iPadOS 7.1+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.10+ · tvOS 7.1+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 1.0+

Creates an action that changes a sprite’s texture.

## Declaration

```swift
class func setTexture(_ texture: SKTexture) -> SKAction
```

## Parameters

- `texture`: The new texture to use on the sprite.

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

A new action object.

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

This action can only be executed by an [SKSpriteNode](../skspritenode.md) object. When the action executes, the sprite’s [texture](../skspritenode/texture.md) property changes immediately to the new texture.

This action is not reversible; the reverse of this action does nothing.
