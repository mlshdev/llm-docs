# strength(by:duration:) (Swift)

**Framework:** SpriteKit  
**Kind:** Type Method  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ · iPadOS 8.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.10+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 1.0+

Creates an action that animates a change of a physics field’s strength to a value relative to the existing value.

## Declaration

```swift
class func strength(by strength: Float, duration: TimeInterval) -> SKAction
```

## Parameters

- `strength`: The value to add to the field.
- `duration`: The duration of the animation.

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

A new action object.

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

When the action executes, the field node’s [strength](../skfieldnode/strength.md) property animates from its current value to its new value.

This action is reversible; the reverse is created as if the following code is executed:

**Swift**

```swift
let action = SKAction.strength(by: -strength, duration: sec)
```

**Obj-C**

```objc
[SKAction strengthBy: -strength duration: sec];
```
