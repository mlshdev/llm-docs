# changeMass(by:duration:) (Swift)

**Framework:** SpriteKit  
**Kind:** Type Method  
**Availability:** iOS 9.0+ · iPadOS 9.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.11+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

Creates an action that changes the mass of a node’s physics body by a relative value.

## Declaration

```swift
class func changeMass(by v: Float, duration: TimeInterval) -> SKAction
```

## Parameters

- `v`: The amount to add to the physics body’s mass.
- `duration`: The duration of the animation.

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

A new action object.

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

When the action executes, the physics body’s [mass](../skphysicsbody/mass.md) property animates from its current value to its new value.

This action is reversible; the reverse is created as if the following code is executed:

**Swift**

```swift
let action = SKAction.changeMass(by: -v, duration: sec)
```

**Obj-C**

```objc
[SKAction changeMassBy: -v duration: sec];
```
