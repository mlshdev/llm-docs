# Adding a Video to a Scene (Swift)

**Framework:** SpriteKit  
**Kind:** Article

Play video in your scene by adding a video node.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

A video node renders a video at a given size and location in your scene with no exposed player controls. You might use a video node to animate visual behaviors that would be expensive to define using a collection of textures.

Be aware that a video node offers only a subset of the features available to the [SKSpriteNode](skspritenode.md) class. The following are a video node’s relevant limitations:

- A video node is always scaled proportionally.
- A video node cannot be colorized. However, it can be added as a child of a [SKEffectNode](skeffectnode.md) to add Core Image filters for color treatments and other effects.
- A video node always uses an alpha blend mode.
- A video node cannot use custom shaders or lighting.

When a video node is created, its [size](skvideonode/size.md) property is initialized to the base size of the video content, but you can change it. The video content is automatically stretched to the new size. As with a sprite node, the [anchorPoint](skvideonode/anchorpoint.md) property defines where the content is displayed relative to the node position.

The following code initializes the video node using a video file stored in the app bundle and then adds the node to the scene. It calls the node’s [play()](skvideonode/play%28%29.md) method to start the video playback.

**Swift**

```swift
let sample = SKVideoNode(fileNamed: "sample.mov")
sample.position = CGPoint(x: frame.midX,
                          y: frame.midY)
addChild(sample)
sample.play()
```

**Obj-C**

```objc
SKVideoNode *sample = [SKVideoNode videoNodeWithFileNamed:@"sample.mov"];
sample.position = CGPointMake(CGRectGetMidX(self.frame),
                              CGRectGetMidY(self.frame));
[self addChild: sample];
[sample play];
```

You control playback using the node’s [play()](skvideonode/play%28%29.md) and [pause()](skvideonode/pause%28%29.md) methods.

If you need more precise control over the video playback behavior, you can use AVFoundation to create an [AVPlayer](../avfoundation/avplayer.md) object for your video content and then use this object to initialize the [SKVideoNode](skvideonode.md) node. Then, instead of using the node’s playback methods, you use the [AVPlayer](../avfoundation/avplayer.md) object to control playback. The video content is automatically displayed in the video node.
