# Using Base Nodes to Lay Out SpriteKit Content

**Interface languages:** Swift, Objective-C

**Framework:** SpriteKit  
**Kind:** Article

Use nonvisual nodes to define the layout of a scene.

## Overview

Each onscreen element in SpriteKit is referred to as a *node*. Nodes are either visual elements or containers of other nodes. You set up the appearance of a SpriteKit scene by adding nodes alongside and on top of each other in a hierarchical form. Collectively, this structure is referred to as the *node tree* or the *node hierarchy*.

These are the basic nonvisual nodes in SpriteKit:

- [SKNode](sknode.md) is a container node. It doesn’t render any content of its own, but works as a layout tool for its child nodes.
- [SKReferenceNode](skreferencenode.md) doesn’t define content of its own, but refers to another node or archived file that does.
- [SKCameraNode](skcameranode.md) defines point of view within a scene. Its inverse scale is applied to all nodes in the hierarchy except for its children. Use the children of `SKCameraNode` for UI elements that should be unaffected by zoom level.

For a list of visual elements, see Nodes that Draw in [Nodes for Scene Building](nodes-for-scene-building.md), which also includes some examples of using visual nodes.
