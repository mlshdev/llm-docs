A pace analysis results for the song.

## Declaration

```swift
struct PaceResult
```

## Overview

The results indicate the energy and momentum of the music over time. Parts of a song that feel faster or more energetic have a higher value compared to slower or less energetic parts of a song. These values represent a perceptual events-per-minute rate. The perceptual events-per-minute rate allows you to synchronize behaviors with the music’s changing energy, independent of the fixed tempo. For example, a song with a high BPM might yield a lower `Pace` value during a sparse breakdown.
