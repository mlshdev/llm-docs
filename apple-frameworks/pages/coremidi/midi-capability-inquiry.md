# MIDI Capability Inquiry (Swift)

**Framework:** Core MIDI  
**Kind:** API Collection

Provide support for bidirectional discovery and configuration of devices.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

MIDI Capability Inquiry (MIDI-CI) uses bidirectional communication to enable devices to exchange information about their capabilities and automatically configure themselves to work together. MIDI-CI discovers and configures devices using the following means:

- Profile configuration. Profiles define a standard set of rules for how devices respond to MIDI messages. For example, devices that support a piano profile respond to messages common to a piano, such as note on and off, velocity, and pedaling.
- Property exchange. Devices can use a set of System Exclusive (SysEx) messages to find and control various properties of other devices.
- Protocol negotiation. MIDI 2.0 devices can select between using the MIDI 1.0 or 2.0 protocols, falling back to 1.0 when not supported by other devices.

MIDI-CI defines two roles in the communication between devices: *initiator* and *responder*. Client processes acting as the initiator use the [MIDICISession](midicisession.md) API, which allows for profile and property configuration of the associated responder. Client processes that advertise their own profile and property capabilities use the [MIDICIResponder](midiciresponder.md) API, which sends responder-originated messages to initiators.

## Topics

### Capability Inquiry

- [MIDICIDiscoveryManager](midicidiscoverymanager.md): Deprecated. A singleton object that performs systemwide MIDI-CI discovery.
- [MIDICISession](midicisession.md): Deprecated. An object that represents a MIDI-CI session.
- [MIDICIProfile](midiciprofile.md): A mapping of MIDI messages to specific sounds and synthesis behaviors, such as General MIDI, a drawbar organ, and so on.
- [MIDICIProfileState](midiciprofilestate.md): An object that provides the enabled and disabled profiles for a MIDI channel or port on a device.
- [MIDICIResponder](midiciresponder.md): Deprecated. An object that responds to MIDI-CI inquiries from an initiator on behalf of a MIDI client, and handles profile and property exchange operations.
