# reactiveMaskTexture (Swift)

**Framework:** MetalFX  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ · iPadOS 8.0+ · Mac Catalyst 8.0+ · macOS 10.11+ · tvOS · visionOS 1.0+

The reactive-mask texture input this scaler uses.

## Declaration

```swift
var reactiveMaskTexture: (any MTLTexture)? { get set }
```

## Discussion

This texture helps guide the denoiser when objects move quickly in a scene with inaccurate motion information, such as when they involve alpha blending. In these situations, you can get better results by guiding MetalFX whether to favor the current frame on a per-pixel basis with a reactive mask texture.

When providing this texture, you are responsible for ensuring each pixel is in the range `[0.0, 1.0]`, where a value:

- Equal to `0.0` tells MetalFX to follow its normal behavior for the corresponding pixel
- Equal to `1.0` tells MetalFX to ignore temporal history for the corresponding pixel
- In the range `(0.0, 1.0)` proportionally blends the effect for the corresponding pixel
