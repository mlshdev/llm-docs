# init(overlapFactor:featureExtractor:featureExtractionTimeWindowSize:)

**Framework:** Create ML  
**Kind:** Initializer  
**Availability:** iOS 15.0+ · iPadOS 15.0+ · Mac Catalyst 15.0+ · macOS 12.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

Creates the parameters for a feature-extraction session.

## Declaration

```swift
init(overlapFactor: Double = __Defaults.overlapFactor, featureExtractor: MLSoundClassifier.ModelParameters.FeatureExtractorType = __Defaults.featureExtractor, featureExtractionTimeWindowSize: TimeInterval?)
```

## Parameters

- `overlapFactor`: A portion of overlap between consecutive audio analysis windows. The value must be in the range `[0.0, 1.0)`.
- `featureExtractor`: An algorithm type the session uses to extract features from audio files.
- `featureExtractionTimeWindowSize`: A time duration, in seconds, the feature-extraction session uses for each audio sample it reads from an audio file in a dataset. The value must be in the range `[0.5, 15.0]`.
