# Preliminary_Action

A specific task that a trigger performs.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Because it inherits `Typed`, this schema declares a `Preliminary_Action` as a type of prim. For more information about typed schemas, see USD Specification \> [Typed](http://graphics.pixar.com/usd/docs/USD-Glossary.html#USDGlossary-TypedSchema).

When a behavior executes an action, the behavior modifies the state of the scene dynamically. For example, an action might start an animation, change the location of a prim, or start playing audio.

### Declaration

```swift
class "Preliminary_Action" (
    inherits = </Typed>
)
```

<a id="Define-an-action-that-slides-a-cube"></a>

### Define an action that slides a cube

The following example shows an action prim called `PushCube` that affects an impulse feature.

```swift
#usda 1.0

def Cube "Cube" {}

def Preliminary_Action "PushCube" {    
    uniform token info:id = "Impulse"
    rel affectedObjects = [ </Cube> ]
    uniform vector3d velocity = (1.0, 0.0, 0.0)
}
```
