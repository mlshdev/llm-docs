## Overview

To provide a transform, assign an [Xformable](https://openusd.org/docs/api/class_usd_geom_xformable.html) prim to this property.

The prims in the list of [affectedObjects](affectedobjects.md) animate from their current transform to the transform that this prim specifies. Include in the prim the transformational operations that implement the transform animation. For more information, see [xformOp](https://openusd.org/docs/api/class_usd_geom_xform_op.html).
