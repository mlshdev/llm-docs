Metadata that determines the lighting environment of virtual content.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

This metadata selects one of two predefined options for the scene’s image-based lighting (IBL). AR Quick Look in iOS 16 and later observes this property to enhance the brightness, contrast, and visual definition of a scene’s virtual content.

A value of `1` indicates the classic lighting environment, and a value of `2` indicates the new lighting environment.

On the right, a 3D asset of the same biplane toy features even more shine and refections, and its callout reads Preferred IBL version = 2.](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.usd/media-4107512.png)

If you omit the [preferredIblVersion](preferrediblversion.md) metadata or give it a value of `0`, the system checks the asset’s creation timestamp. A timestamp of July 1, 2022, or later results in the new lighting environment; otherwise, the scene features classic lighting for backward compatibility. The system checks the timestamp of the `.usd` asset within the `.usdz` archive, not the archive’s file creation date.

### Declaration

```other
int preferredIblVersion = 0
```

<a id="Select-the-scenes-image-based-lighting"></a>

### Select the scene’s image-based lighting

The following `.usda` definition chooses the new lighting environment:

```other
// asset.usda
#usda 1.0
(
    customLayerData = {
        dictionary Apple = {
            int preferredIblVersion = 2
        }
    }
)

```

> **Tip**

> RealityKit doesn’t observe the [preferredIblVersion](preferrediblversion.md) metadata, but you configure the same lighting environment manually. See [Specifying a lighting environment in AR Quick Look](../arkit/specifying-a-lighting-environment-in-ar-quick-look.md) for more information about matching AR Quick Look’s lighting environment in RealityKit apps.
