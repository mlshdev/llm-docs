### Vertical Alignments for Multiline Text

For multiline text, each line of text bases its vertical alignment on the text’s bounding box.

- **`top`**: Aligns each line of text vertically with the top.
- **`middle, lowerMiddle`**: Aligns each line of text in the center with equal space above and below the line of text.
- **`baseline, bottom`**: Aligns each line of text vertically with the bottom.
