<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

The default value is `false`, in which the group executes its actions [performCount](performcount.md) number of times and then stops.

When `true` and [type](type.md) is `serial`, the group restarts its action sequence with the first action after the last action completes. When [type](type.md) is `parallel`, the runtime repeats each action independently.
