# OrbitAction

An action that orbits a set of prims around another.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

This action sends the list of prims defined by [affectedObjects](affectedobjects.md) into orbit at a fixed distance around its [center](center.md) prim, on a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation. The runtime caculates the fixed distance as a straight line between the respective origins of the [affectedObjects](affectedobjects.md) and the [center](center.md).
