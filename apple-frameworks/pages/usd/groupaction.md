# GroupAction

An action that runs a list of other actions.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

This action defines how the runtime executes each action in the [actions](actions.md) array. When [type](type.md) is `serial`, the runtime performs [actions](actions.md) one after the other. When [type](type.md) is `concurrent`, the runtime starts each action at the same time.

When this action’s [type](type.md) is `serial`, you can specify a delay between two actions by placing a `WaitAction` between them.

### Declaration

```other
class Preliminary_Action "GroupAction"
```

<a id="Create-a-sequential-or-looping-group-action"></a>

### Create a sequential or looping group action

The following example defines a group of actions that run sequentially. The group contains a flip action, a wait action, and a hide action.

```other
def Preliminary_Action "SimpleGroup" (
    inherits = </GroupAction>
)
{
    rel actions = [ <Flip>, <Wait>, <Hide> ]
    uniform bool loops = false
    uniform uint performCount = 1

    def Action "Flip" (
        inherits = </EmphasizeAction>
    )
    {
        uniform token motionType = "flip"
    }

    def Action "Wait" (
        inherits = </WaitAction>
    )
    {
    }

    def Action "Hide" (
        inherits = </VisibilityAction>
    )
    {
        uniform token type = "hide"
    }
}
```

The following group named `EndlessLoop` repeats a set of actions indefinitely because `performCount` is `0`.

```swift
def Action "EndlessLoop" (
    inherits = </GroupAction>
)
{
    rel actions = [...]
    uniform bool loops = true
    uniform uint performCount = 0
}
```
