# preliminary:imageAnchoring:referenceImage

**Kind:** Article

The characteristics of an image the runtime should scan for in order to attach a prim.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

An asset assigns this property a prim with type `Preliminary_ReferenceImage`.

The runtime searches for an image described by this property in the physical environment. If the runtime finds a match, it places a prim at the image’s real-world location. When a runtime places a prim in the physical environment, the prim’s children also attach to that location.

The runtime employs the information contained in this property only when [preliminary:anchoring:type](preliminary-anchoring-type.md) is `image`.

### Declaration

```other
rel preliminary:imageAnchoring:referenceImage
```

<a id="Anchor-a-cube-to-an-image"></a>

### Anchor a cube to an image

The following example demonstrates how an asset defines a reference image (`ImageReference`) that the runtime should look for in the physical environment. The asset includes a cube that assigns an [Preliminary_ReferenceImage](preliminary-referenceimage.md) to its [preliminary:imageAnchoring:referenceImage](preliminary-imageanchoring-referenceimage.md) property, instructing the runtime to anchor it to a real-world object that matches the image criteria.

```other
def Cube "ImageAnchoredCube" (
    prepend apiSchemas = [ "Preliminary_AnchoringAPI" ]
)
{
    uniform token preliminary:anchoring:type = "image"
    rel preliminary:imageAnchoring:referenceImage = <ImageReference>
    ...

    def Preliminary_ReferenceImage "ImageReference"
    {
      uniform asset image = @image.png@
      uniform double physicalWidth = 0.12
    }
}
```
