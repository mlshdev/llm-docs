# Preliminary_Trigger

A condition that, when met, performs an action.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Because it inherits `Typed`, this schema declares a `Preliminary_Trigger` as a type of prim. For more information about typed schemas, see USD Specification \> [Typed](http://graphics.pixar.com/usd/docs/USD-Glossary.html#USDGlossary-TypedSchema).

The runtime executes triggers based on:

- User input, like a user’s tap gesture.
- Scene state, including a prim’s proximity to the user’s device.
- Programmatic conditions, like application state or a function result.

### Declaration

### Add a tap trigger to a cube

The following example shows how a prim named `TapCube` opts in to notification of user taps.

```other
#usda 1.0

def Cube "Cube" {}

def Preliminary_Trigger "TapCube" {
    uniform token info:id = "TapGesture"
    rel affectedObjects = [ </Cube> ]
}
```
