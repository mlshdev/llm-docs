# UNNotificationDismissActionIdentifier (Swift)

**Framework:** User Notifications  
**Kind:** Global Variable  
**Availability:** iOS 10.0+ · iPadOS 10.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.14+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 3.0+

The action that indicates the user explicitly dismissed the notification interface.

## Declaration

```swift
let UNNotificationDismissActionIdentifier: String
```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

The system delivers this action only if your app configured the notification’s category object with the [customDismissAction](unnotificationcategoryoptions/customdismissaction.md) option. To trigger this action, the user must explicitly dismiss the notification interface. For example, the user must tap the Dismiss button or swipe down on the notification interface in watchOS to trigger this action.

Ignoring a notification or flicking away a notification banner doesn’t trigger this action.
