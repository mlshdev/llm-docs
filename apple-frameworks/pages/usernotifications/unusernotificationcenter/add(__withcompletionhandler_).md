# add(\_:withCompletionHandler:) (Swift)

**Framework:** User Notifications  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 10.0+ · iPadOS 10.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.14+ · tvOS 10.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 3.0+

Schedules the delivery of a local notification.

## Declaration

```swift
func add(_ request: UNNotificationRequest, withCompletionHandler completionHandler: (@Sendable ((any Error)?) -> Void)? = nil)
```

```swift
func add(_ request: UNNotificationRequest) async throws
```

## Parameters

- `request`: The request object containing the notification payload and trigger information. This parameter must not be `nil`.
- `completionHandler`: The block to execute with the results. This block may be executed on a background thread. The block has no return value and takes the following parameter:

  - **error**: An error object indicating whether a problem occurred. If the notification was scheduled successfully, this parameter is `nil`; otherwise, it is set to an error object indicating the reason for the failure.

This method schedules local notifications only; you cannot use it to schedule the delivery of remote notifications. Upon calling this method, the system begins tracking the trigger conditions associated with your request. When the trigger condition is met, the system delivers your notification. If the request does not contain a [UNNotificationTrigger](../unnotificationtrigger.md) object, the notification is delivered right away.

You may call this method from any thread of your app.

```swift
let center = UNUserNotificationCenter.current()
let content = UNMutableNotificationContent()
content.title = "My notification title"
content.body = "My notification body"
let notification = UNNotificationRequest(identifier: "com.example.mynotification", content: content, trigger: nil)
do {
    try await center.add(notification)
} catch {
    // Handle any errors.
}
```
