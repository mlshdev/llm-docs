# getNotificationSettings(completionHandler:) (Swift)

**Framework:** User Notifications  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 10.0+ · iPadOS 10.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.14+ · tvOS 10.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 3.0+

Retrieves the authorization and feature-related settings for your app.

## Declaration

```swift
func getNotificationSettings(completionHandler: @escaping @Sendable (UNNotificationSettings) -> Void)
```

```swift
func notificationSettings() async -> UNNotificationSettings
```

## Parameters

- `completionHandler`: The block to execute asynchronously with the results. Your app may execute this block on a background thread. The block has no return value and takes the following parameter:

  - **settings**: The [UNNotificationSettings](../unnotificationsettings.md) object containing the current authorization settings for your app.

## Mentioned In

- [Asking permission to use notifications](../asking-permission-to-use-notifications.md)

>  You can call this method from synchronous code using a completion handler, as shown on this page, or you can call it as an asynchronous method that has the following declaration:

Use this method to determine the user interactions and notification-related features that the system authorizes your app to use. You might then use this information to enable or disable specific notification-related features of your app.

```swift
let center = UNUserNotificationCenter.current()
let settings = await center.notificationSettings()
// Add code here to inspect or act on the settings.
```

When the user initially grants authorization to your app, the system gives your app a set of default notification-related settings. The user may change those settings at any time to enable or disable specific capabilities. For example, the user might disable the playing of sounds when a notification arrives.
