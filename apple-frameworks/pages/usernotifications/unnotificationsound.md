# UNNotificationSound (Swift)

**Framework:** User Notifications

## Overview

Create a [UNNotificationSound](unnotificationsound.md) object when you want the system to play a specific sound when it delivers with your notification. To play the default system sound, create your sound object using the [default](unnotificationsound/default.md) method. If you want to play a custom sound, create a new sound object and specify the name of the audio file that you want to play.

For local notifications, assign the sound object to the [sound](unmutablenotificationcontent/sound.md) property of your [UNMutableNotificationContent](unmutablenotificationcontent.md) object. For a remote notification, assign the name of your sound file to the `sound` key in the `aps` dictionary. You can also use a notification service app extension to add a sound file to a notification shortly before delivery. In your extension, create a [UNNotificationSound](unnotificationsound.md) object and add it to your notification content in the same way that you’d for a local notification.

Audio files must already be on the user’s device before the system can play them. If you use a predefined set of sounds for your notifications, include the audio files in your app’s bundle. For all other sounds, the [UNNotificationSound](unnotificationsound.md) object looks only in the following locations:

- The `/Library/Sounds` directory of the app’s container directory.
- The `/Library/Sounds` directory of one of the app’s shared group container directories.
- The main bundle of the current executable.

### Prepare Sound Resources

The system sound facility plays custom alert sounds, so they must be in one of the following audio data formats:

- Linear PCM
- MA4 (IMA/ADPCM)
- µLaw
- aLaw

You can package the audio data in an `aiff`, `wav`, or `caf` file. Sound files must be less than 30 seconds in length. If the sound file is longer than 30 seconds, the system plays the default sound instead.

You can use the `afconvert` command-line tool to convert sounds. For example, to convert the system sound `Submarine.aiff` to IMA4 audio in a CAF file, use the following command in Terminal:

`afconvert /System/Library/Sounds/Submarine.aiff ~/Desktop/sub.caf -d ima4 -f caff -v`
