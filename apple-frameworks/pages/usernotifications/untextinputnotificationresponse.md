# UNTextInputNotificationResponse (Swift)

**Framework:** User Notifications  
**Kind:** Class  
**Availability:** iOS 10.0+ · iPadOS 10.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.14+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 3.0+

The user’s response to an actionable notification, including any custom text that the user typed or dictated.

## Declaration

```swift
class UNTextInputNotificationResponse
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

The system delivers a [UNTextInputNotificationResponse](untextinputnotificationresponse.md) object to your app so that you can process user-provided text content. When defining your categories, you can specify an [UNTextInputNotificationAction](untextinputnotificationaction.md) object instead of an [UNNotificationAction](unnotificationaction.md) object for your action. If you do, the system creates an [UNTextInputNotificationResponse](untextinputnotificationresponse.md) object when the user selects the accompanying action, and it fills the [userText](untextinputnotificationresponse/usertext.md) property with any user-entered text.

You don’t create [UNTextInputNotificationResponse](untextinputnotificationresponse.md) objects yourself. Instead, the shared user notification center object creates them and delivers them to the [userNotificationCenter(\_:didReceive:withCompletionHandler:)](unusernotificationcenterdelegate/usernotificationcenter%28__didreceive_withcompletionhandler_%29.md) method of its delegate object. Use that method to extract any needed information from the response object and take appropriate action.
