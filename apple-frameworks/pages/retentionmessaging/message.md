# message

**Framework:** Retention Messaging API  
**Kind:** Object  
**Availability:** Retention Messaging API 1.0+

A message identifier you provide in a real-time response to your Get Retention Message endpoint.

## Declaration

```

## Properties

- `messageIdentifier` — `messageIdentifier`: The identifier of the message to display to the customer.

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

In your [RealtimeResponseBody](realtimeresponsebody.md) real-time response, you can choose from mutually exclusive options. Include `message` in your response to provide a text-based message (with or without an image) as the retention message the system displays to the customer.

The message identifier needs to refer to a message that has a [messageState](messagestate.md) of `APPROVED`; otherwise, the retention message fails. If the message includes an image, the image also needs to have an [imageState](imagestate.md) of `APPROVED`. For more information about setting up messages, see [Setting up retention messages](setting-up-retention-messages.md).
