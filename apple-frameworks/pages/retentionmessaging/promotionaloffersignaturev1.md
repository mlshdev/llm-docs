## Discussion

To provide a promotional-offer retention message, you need to cryptographically sign the offer and include it in the [promotionalOffer](promotionaloffer.md) parameter of your [RealtimeResponseBody](realtimeresponsebody.md) response.

> **Tip**

> For a simpler implementation, use [promotionalOfferSignatureV2](promotionaloffersignaturev2.md) instead.

For instructions on generating the `encodedSignature` for the `promotionalOfferSignatureV1`, see [Generating a signature for promotional offers](../storekit/generating-a-signature-for-promotional-offers.md).
