# Identifying rate limits

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** Retention Messaging API  
**Kind:** Article

Recognize the rate limits that apply to Retention Messaging API endpoints, and handle them in your code.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

The Retention Messaging API limits the number of requests that you can submit to each endpoint within a specified timespan. The request limits apply per app.

The following table lists the rate limits for each endpoint in the production environment, expressed in requests per second. The system enforces rate limits on an hourly basis.

| Endpoint | Rate limit (per second) |
| --- | --- |
| [Configure Default Message](configure-default-message.md) | 10 |
| [Configure Realtime URL](configure-realtime-url.md) | 1 |
| [Delete Default Message](delete-default-message.md) | 1 |
| [Delete Image](delete-image.md) | 1 |
| [Delete Message](delete-message.md) | 1 |
| [Delete Realtime URL](delete-realtime-url.md) | 1 |
| [Get Default Message](get-default-message.md) | 1 |
| [Get Image List](get-image-list.md) | 1 |
| [Get Message List](get-message-list.md) | 1 |
| [Get Performance Test Results](get-performance-test-results.md) | 1 |
| [Get Realtime URL](get-realtime-url.md) | 1 |
| [Initiate Performance Test](initiate-performance-test.md) | 1 |
| [Upload Image](upload-image.md) | 1 |
| [Upload Message](upload-message.md) | 1 |

The rate limits in the sandbox environment are 10% of the limits in the table above.

The App Store server may make adjustments to reduce or increase these rate limits as needed at any time.

### Handle exceeded rate limits gracefully

If you exceed a per-hour limit, the API rejects the request with an `HTTP` `429` response with a [RateLimitExceededError](ratelimitexceedederror.md) object in the body.  Consider the following as you integrate the API:

- If you periodically call the API, throttle your requests to avoid exceeding the per-hour limit for an endpoint.
- Manage the `HTTP` `429` `RateLimitExceededError` response in your error-handling process. For example, log the failure and queue the job to process it again at a later time.
- Check the `Retry-After` header if you receive the `HTTP` `429` error. This header contains a UNIX time, in milliseconds, that indicates when you can next send a request.
