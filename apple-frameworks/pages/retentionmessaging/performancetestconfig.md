**Kind:** Object  
**Availability:** Retention Messaging API 1.3+

An object that enumerates the test configuration parameters.

## Declaration

```
object PerformanceTestConfig
```

## Properties

- `maxConcurrentRequests` — `int64` (required): The maximum number of concurrent requests the API allows.
- `responseTimeThreshold` — `int64` (required): The maximum time your server has to respond when the system calls your `Get Retention Message` endpoint in the sandbox environment.
- `successRateThreshold` — `int32` (required): The success rate threshold percentage.
- `totalDuration` — `int64` (required): The total duration of the test in milliseconds.
- `totalRequests` — `integer` (required): The total number of requests to make during the test.

## Overview

The [Initiate Performance Test](initiate-performance-test.md) endpoint returns the `PerformanceTestConfig` object in the [PerformanceTestResponse](performancetestresponse.md) response.

When you call the [Initiate Performance Test](initiate-performance-test.md) endpoint to start a performance test, the test sends multiple requests and runs for a period of time. To calculate the time when the test concludes, add the `totalDuration` to the time, in milliseconds, you initiated the test.
