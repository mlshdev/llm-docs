## Discussion

In your [RealtimeResponseBody](realtimeresponsebody.md) real-time response, you can choose from mutually exclusive options. Include `promotionalOffer` in your response to provide a retention message with a promotional offer. The message identifier needs to refer to a message that doesn’t have an image, and that has a [messageState](messagestate.md) of `APPROVED`; otherwise, the retention message fails. For more information about setting up messages, see [Upload Message](upload-message.md).

For new implementations, consider using the [promotionalOfferSignatureV2](promotionaloffersignaturev2.md) signature, which is easier to generate.

For more information on generating the signatures, see [promotionalOfferSignatureV1](promotionaloffersignaturev1.md) and [promotionalOfferSignatureV2](promotionaloffersignaturev2.md).
