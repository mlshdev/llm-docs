## Discussion

This is the request body for the `Get Retention Message` endpoint, which you can implement to choose retention messages for customers in real time. For more information about the endpoint, see [Setting up your Get Retention Message endpoint](setting-up-retention-messaging-endpoint.md).

The `signedPayload` is a string of three Base64URL-encoded components separated by a period. The string contains the JWS Compact Serialization of the real-time request, signed by the App Store according to the JSON Web Signature (JWS) [IETF RFC 7515](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7515) specification.

The three components of the string are a header, a payload, and a signature, in that order.

- To read the real-time request information, Base64URL-decode the payload. Use a [DecodedRealtimeRequestBody](decodedrealtimerequestbody.md) object to read the payload information.
- To read the header, decode it and use a [JWSDecodedHeader](jwsdecodedheader.md) object to access the information. Use the information in the header to verify the signature.
