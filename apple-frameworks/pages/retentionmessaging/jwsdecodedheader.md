# JWSDecodedHeader

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** Retention Messaging API  
**Kind:** Object  
**Availability:** Retention Messaging API 1.0+

A decoded JSON Web Signature (JWS) header.

## Declaration

```
object JWSDecodedHeader
```

## Properties

- `alg` — `alg`: The algorithm the App Store uses for signing the JSON Web Signature (JWS).
- `x5c` — `x5c`: An array that contains the X.509 certificate chain, which you use to verify the public key that the App Store uses to sign the JWS.

## Discussion

The type [RealtimeRequestBody](realtimerequestbody.md) contains a header that’s a `JWSDecodedHeader` object when decoded. Use the information in the `JWSDecodedHeader` to validate the JWS signature of the request body. For more information about validating signatures, see the JSON Web Signature (JWS) [IETF RFC 7515](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7515) specification.

The signature uses the `x5c` certificate chain, in the following order:

1. A certificate that contains the public key that corresponds to the key the App Store uses to digitally sign the JWS. Section 4.11.10 Mac App Store Receipt Signing Certificates of the [Apple Inc. Certificate Practice Statement Worldwide Developer Relations](https://images.apple.com/certificateauthority/pdf/Apple_WWDR_CPS_v1.26.pdf) document defines the custom extensions this certificate uses.
2. An Apple intermediate certificate that contains an extension with the extension ID for `Apple Worldwide Developer Relations (1.2.840.113635.100.6.2.1)`.
3. An Apple root certificate.

For more information, or to download Apple’s root certificate, see [Apple PKI](https://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/).
