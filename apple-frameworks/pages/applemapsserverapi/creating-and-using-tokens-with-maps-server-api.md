# Creating and using tokens with Maps Server API

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** Apple Maps Server API  
**Kind:** Article

Sign JSON Web Tokens to use Maps Server API and debug common signing errors.

## Overview

Maps Server API uses a Maps token to authenticate map initializations and other API requests, such as requests to retrieve directions or execute a search. To use a Maps token with Maps Server API you must have an Apple Developer account and obtain a Maps ID and a private key as described in [Creating a Maps identifier and a private key](creating-a-maps-identifier-and-a-private-key.md).

After getting or creating a token, confirm the success of the token authorization by using the token to access the API; check the status codes that the API responses return to verify the calls were successful.

## Create a token to use Maps Server API

Maps Server API requires a Maps token to initialize MapKit. A Maps token has two sections, a header and a payload. The header describes the token and the cryptographic operations applied to the payload. The payload contains a set of cryptographically signed claims.

Construct a token with these required fields in the header:

- **`alg`**: The algorithm you use to sign the token. Use the `ES256` algorithm to sign your token.
- **`kid`**: A 10-character key identifier that provides the ID of the private key that you obtain from your Apple Developer account.
- **`typ`**: A type parameter that you set to `"JWT"`.

In the payload section of the token, include the following claims:

- **`iss`**: The issuer of the token. This is a 10-character Team ID obtained from your Apple Developer account.
- **`iat`**: The “Issued At” registered claim key. The value of this claim indicates the token creation time, in terms of the number of seconds since UNIX Epoch, in UTC.
- **`exp`**: The “Expiration Time” registered claim key. The value of this claim indicates when the token expires, in terms of the number of seconds since the UNIX Epoch, in UTC.
- **`scope`**: A space-separated list of one or more Apple Maps frameworks you are authorizing the token to use. To use Maps Server API, set the value to `"server_api"`. See [Available token scopes](creating-and-using-tokens-with-maps-server-api.md#Available-token-scopes) for scope values of other Apple Maps frameworks.
- **`origin`**: Specifies the origins allowed when you make requests from a web browser. Use a domain pattern such as `*.example.com`, a specific domain such as `example.com`, or a comma-separated list of origins for multiple domains such as `example.com,*.subdomain.com`. The token requires an origin when the scope includes `mapkit_js`, `web_snapshots`, or `embed_api`.

To locate your Team ID, sign in to your [Apple Developer account](https://developer.apple.com/account), and click Membership in the sidebar. Your Team ID appears in the Membership information section under the team name. Generate your token by signing it with your private key.

> **Note**

> As a security best practice, consider creating separate tokens for each product scope. Using tokens with a single scope helps limit exposure when a token is compromised.

When decoded, a token for use with Maps Server API has the following format:

```other
{
    "alg": "ES256",
    "kid": "ABC123DEFG",
    "typ": "JWT"
}
{
    "iss": "DEF123GHIJ",
    "iat": 1437179036,
    "exp": 1493298100,
    "scope": "server_api",
    "origin": "*.example.com"
}
```

To learn more about Maps tokens, see the [JSON Web Token (JWT) specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519). You can find a collection of libraries for generating signed tokens at [JWT.io](https://jwt.io).

For next steps, go to [Generate a Maps token](-v1-token.md).

## Available token scopes

The `scope` claim sets one or more Apple Maps frameworks you are authorizing the token to use. Available values are:

- **`embed_api`**: [Maps Embed API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkitjs/displaying-place-information-using-the-maps-embed-api)
- **`mapkit_js`**: [MapKit JS](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkitjs/)
- **`server_api`**: Maps Server API
- **`web_snapshots`**: [Maps Web Snapshots](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/snapshots/)

Instead of signing a token dynamically, you can use a static token when using any Apple Maps frameworks other than Maps Server API. See [Creating a Maps token](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/MapKitJS/creating-a-maps-token).
