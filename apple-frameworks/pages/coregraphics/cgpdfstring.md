# CGPDFString (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Graphics  
**Kind:** API Collection

A text string in a PDF document.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

A PDF string object is a series of bytes—unsigned integer values in the range 0 to 255.

The string elements are not integer objects, but are stored in a more compact format. For more information on the representation of strings in PDF, see the latest version of *PDF Reference*, Adobe Systems Incorporated.

This object is not derived from CFType and therefore there are no functions for retaining and releasing it. CGPDFString objects exist as constituent parts of a CGPDFDocument object, and are managed by their container.

## Topics

### Converting PDF Strings

- [CGPDFStringCopyTextString(\_:)](cgpdfstringcopytextstring%28__%29.md): Returns a CFString object that represents a PDF string as a text string.
- [CGPDFStringCopyDate(\_:)](cgpdfstringcopydate%28__%29.md): Converts a string to a date.

### Getting PDF String Data

- [CGPDFStringGetBytePtr(\_:)](cgpdfstringgetbyteptr%28__%29.md): Returns a pointer to the bytes of a PDF string.
- [CGPDFStringGetLength(\_:)](cgpdfstringgetlength%28__%29.md): Returns the number of bytes in a PDF string.

### Data Types

- [CGPDFStringRef](cgpdfstringref.md): A data type that represents a string in a PDF document.
