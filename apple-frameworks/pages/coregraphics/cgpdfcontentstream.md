# CGPDFContentStream (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Graphics  
**Kind:** API Collection

A representation of one or more content data streams in a PDF page.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

A [CGPDFContentStreamRef](cgpdfcontentstreamref.md) object represents one or more PDF content streams for a page and their associated resource dictionaries. A PDF content stream is a sequential set of instructions that specifies how to paint items on a PDF page. A resource dictionary contains information needed by the content stream in order to decode the sequential instructions of the content stream.

[CGPDFContentStreamRef](cgpdfcontentstreamref.md) functions can retrieve both the content streams and the resource dictionaries associated with a PDF page.

This type is not derived from [CFTypeRef](../corefoundation/cftyperef.md) and therefore there are no functions for retaining and releasing it. [CGPDFContentStreamRef](cgpdfcontentstreamref.md) objects exist only as constituent parts of a [CGPDFDocument](cgpdfdocument.md) object, and they are managed by their container.

## Topics

### Creating a PDF Content Stream Object

- [CGPDFContentStreamCreateWithPage(\_:)](cgpdfcontentstreamcreatewithpage%28__%29.md): Creates a content stream object from a PDF page object.
- [CGPDFContentStreamCreateWithStream(\_:\_:\_:)](cgpdfcontentstreamcreatewithstream%28______%29.md): Creates a PDF content stream object from an existing PDF content stream object.

### Getting Data from a PDF Content Stream Object

- [CGPDFContentStreamGetStreams(\_:)](cgpdfcontentstreamgetstreams%28__%29.md): Gets the array of PDF content streams contained in a PDF content stream object.
- [CGPDFContentStreamGetResource(\_:\_:\_:)](cgpdfcontentstreamgetresource%28______%29.md): Gets the specified resource from a PDF content stream object.

### Retaining and Releasing a PDF Content Stream Object

- [CGPDFContentStreamRetain(\_:)](cgpdfcontentstreamretain%28__%29.md): Increments the retain count of a PDF content stream object.
- [CGPDFContentStreamRelease(\_:)](cgpdfcontentstreamrelease%28__%29.md): Decrements the retain count of a PDF content stream object.

### Data Types

- [CGPDFContentStreamRef](cgpdfcontentstreamref.md): An opaque type that provides access to the data that describes the appearance of a PDF page.
