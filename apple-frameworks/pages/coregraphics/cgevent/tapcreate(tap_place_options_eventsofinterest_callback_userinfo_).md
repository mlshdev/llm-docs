# tapCreate(tap:place:options:eventsOfInterest:callback:userInfo:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Graphics  
**Kind:** Type Method  
**Availability:** Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.4+

Creates an event tap.

## Declaration

```swift
class func tapCreate(tap: CGEventTapLocation, place: CGEventTapPlacement, options: CGEventTapOptions, eventsOfInterest: CGEventMask, callback: CGEventTapCallBack, userInfo: UnsafeMutableRawPointer?) -> CFMachPort?
```

## Parameters

- `tap`: The location of the new event tap. Pass one of the constants listed in [CGEventTapLocation](../cgeventtaplocation.md). Only processes running as the root user may locate an event tap at the point where HID events enter the window server; for other users, this function returns `NULL`.
- `place`: The placement of the new event tap in the list of active event taps. Pass one of the constants listed in [CGEventTapPlacement](../cgeventtapplacement.md).
- `options`: A constant that specifies whether the new event tap is a passive listener or an active filter.
- `eventsOfInterest`: A bit mask that specifies the set of events to be observed. For a list of possible events, see [CGEventType](../cgeventtype.md). For information on how to specify the mask, see [CGEventMask](../cgeventmask.md). If the event tap is not permitted to monitor one or more of the events specified in the `eventsOfInterest` parameter, then the appropriate bits in the mask are cleared. If that action results in an empty mask, this function returns `NULL`.
- `callback`: An event tap callback function that you provide. Your callback function is invoked from the run loop to which the event tap is added as a source. The thread safety of the callback is defined by the run loop’s environment. To learn more about event tap callbacks, see [CGEventTapCallBack](../cgeventtapcallback.md).
- `userInfo`: A pointer to user-defined data. This pointer is passed into the callback function specified in the `callback` parameter.

## Return Value

A Core Foundation mach port that represents the new event tap, or `NULL` if the event tap could not be created. When you are finished using the event tap, you should release the mach port using the function `CFRelease`. Releasing the mach port also releases the tap.

## Discussion

Event taps receive key up and key down events if one of the following conditions is true:

- The current process is running as the root user.
- Access for assistive devices is enabled. In OS X v10.4, you can enable this feature using System Preferences, Universal Access panel, Keyboard view.

After creating an event tap, you can add it to a run loop as follows:

1. Pass the event tap to the [CFMachPortCreateRunLoopSource(\_:\_:\_:)](../../corefoundation/cfmachportcreaterunloopsource%28______%29.md) function to create a run loop event source.
2. Call the [CFRunLoopAddSource(\_:\_:\_:)](../../corefoundation/cfrunloopaddsource%28______%29.md) function to add the source to the appropriate run loop.
