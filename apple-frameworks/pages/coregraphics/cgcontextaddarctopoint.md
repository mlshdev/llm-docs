# CGContextAddArcToPoint

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** Core Graphics  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** iOS 2.0+ · iPadOS 2.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.0+ · tvOS · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

Adds an arc of a circle to the current path, using a radius and tangent points.

## Declaration

```objectivec
extern void CGContextAddArcToPoint(CGContextRef c, CGFloat x1, CGFloat y1, CGFloat x2, CGFloat y2, CGFloat radius);
```

## Parameters

- `c`: A graphics context whose current path is not empty.
- `x1`: The x-value, in user space coordinates, for the end point of the first tangent line. The first tangent line is drawn from the current point to (x1,y1).
- `y1`: The y-value, in user space coordinates, for the end point of the first tangent line. The first tangent line is drawn from the current point to (x1,y1).
- `x2`: The x-value, in user space coordinates, for the end point of the second tangent line. The second tangent line is drawn from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2).
- `y2`: The y-value, in user space coordinates, for the end point of the second tangent line. The second tangent line is drawn from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2).
- `radius`: The radius of the arc, in user space coordinates.

## Discussion

This method calculates two tangent lines—the first from the current point to the point `(x1, y1)`, and the second from the point `(x1, y1)` to the point `(x2, y2)`—then calculates the start and end points for a circular arc of the specified radius such that the arc is tangent to both lines. Finally, this method approximates that arc with a sequence of cubic Bézier curves and appends those curves to the current path.

If the starting point of the arc (that is, the point where a circle of the specified radius must meet the first tangent line in order to also be tangent to the second line) is not the current point, this method appends a straight line segment from the current point to the starting point of the arc.

The ending point of the arc (that is, the point where a circle of the specified radius must meet the second tangent line in order to also be tangent to the first line) becomes the new current point of the path.
