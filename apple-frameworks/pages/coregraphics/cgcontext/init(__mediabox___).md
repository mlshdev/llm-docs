# init(\_:mediaBox:\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Graphics  
**Kind:** Initializer  
**Availability:** iOS 2.0+ · iPadOS 2.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.0+ · tvOS · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

Creates a URL-based PDF graphics context.

## Declaration

```swift
init?(_ url: CFURL, mediaBox: UnsafePointer<CGRect>?, _ auxiliaryInfo: CFDictionary?)
```

## Parameters

- `url`: A Core Foundation URL that specifies where you want to place the resulting PDF file.
- `mediaBox`: A rectangle that specifies the bounds of the PDF. The origin of the rectangle should typically be `(0,0)`. The `CGPDFContextCreateWithURL` function uses this rectangle as the default page media bounding box. If you pass `NULL`, `CGPDFContextCreateWithURL` uses a default page size of 8.5 by 11 inches (612 by 792 points).
- `auxiliaryInfo`: A dictionary that specifies any additional information to be used by the PDF context when generating the PDF file, or `NULL`. The dictionary is retained by the new context, so on return you may safely release it.

## Return Value

A new PDF context, or `NULL` if a context could not be created. In Objective-C, you’re responsible for releasing this object using [CGContextRelease](../cgcontextrelease.md).

## Discussion

When you call this function, Core Graphics creates a PDF drawing environment—that is, a graphics context—to your specifications. When you draw into the resulting context, Core Graphics renders your drawing as a series of PDF drawing commands stored in the specified location.
