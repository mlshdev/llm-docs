# closePath() (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Graphics  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 2.0+ · iPadOS 2.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.0+ · tvOS · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

Closes and terminates the current path’s subpath.

## Declaration

```swift
func closePath()
```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

Appends a line from the current point to the starting point of the current subpath and ends the subpath.

After closing the subpath, your application can begin a new subpath without first calling [CGContextMoveToPoint](../cgcontextmovetopoint.md). In this case, a new subpath is implicitly created with a starting and current point equal to the previous subpath’s starting point.

If the current path is empty or the current subpath is already closed, this function does nothing.
