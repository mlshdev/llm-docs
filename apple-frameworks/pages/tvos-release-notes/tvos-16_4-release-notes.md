#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: `ScrollView` has improved support for right to left languages by default. If you have a `ScrollView` that shouldn’t change its behavior in right to left languages, use the `.environment(\.layoutDirection, .leftToRight)` modifier to ensure the `ScrollView` always sees a left to right layout direction.

- Fixed: Search scopes are now supported on tvOS. (84039097)
- Fixed: Presentations in SwiftUI using the ‘sheet’ or ‘fullScreenCover’ modifier can now be dynamically presented again while a dismiss animation is in progress. Previously, attempting to present again in this case would do nothing.

  Note: A data race in app code that was previously ignored might cause a sheet to be presented again with this change. If this happens, check that your state isn’t triggering a new presentation. (101487810)
