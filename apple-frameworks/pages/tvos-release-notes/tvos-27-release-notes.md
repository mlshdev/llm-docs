<a id="Network-Security"></a>

### Network Security

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- Starting in 27.0 operating systems, select system processes now enforce stricter network security (TLS) requirements. These new requirements might cause connections to fail if the server does not meet them. The affected processes are those involved in MDM, DDM, Automated Device Enrollment, configuration profile installation, app installation, and software updates. Servers must support TLS 1.2 at minimum, using cipher suites and certificates that meet App Transport Security (ATS) requirements.

  For additional details on affected processes, requirements, and how to audit and diagnose failures in managed environments, please reference [Prepare your network environment for stricter security requirements](https://support.apple.com/en-us/126655). For additional details on ATS and the new requirements, please reference [Preventing Insecure Network Connections](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Security/preventing-insecure-network-connections) and [NSRequiresNIAPTLSPackageVersion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/BundleResources/Information-Property-List/NSRequiresNIAPTLSPackageVersion).

- Failed purchases using `SKTestSession` might display error dialogs even when `dialogsDisabled` is set to true.  (184255116)

<a id="Swift-Charts"></a>

### Swift Charts

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: When your project has a minimum deployment target lower than 27.0, using conditionals inside a `Chart` closure produces the warning “Conformance of `_ConditionalContent<TrueContent, FalseContent>` to `ChartContent` is only available in ‘’ 27.0 or newer,” and the app might crash at runtime when that content is loaded.  (174168981)

<a id="SwiftUI"></a>

### SwiftUI

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- `AsyncImage` now automatically caches downloaded images using HTTP caching protocols, allowing servers to control caching behavior via standard headers. You can customize caching for specific images using the new `AsyncImage` initializers that accept `URLRequest` with custom `cachePolicy` settings. Additionally, you can set a custom `URLSession` using the new `View.asyncImageURLSession(_:)` API to control how all child `AsyncImage` views perform data tasks.  (78212597)
- A `@State` declared with an expression as its initial value used to evaluate the expression each time the view struct re-instantiates. In the case of `@State private var model = Model()`, this means `Model.init()` gets called many times throughout the view’s lifetime. Xcode 27 introduces a new `@State` implementation that avoids this repeated evaluation. This new behavior back-deploys to iOS 17 aligned OSes. The new `@State` is implemented with a Swift macro. It is largely source compatible with the property wrapper version, with a few exceptions.

  If you provide an initial value at `@State` declaration, and also try to assign a value to it in an initializer, the initializer value is discarded. This behavior has not changed because of the macro, but some such cases no longer compile:

  ```
   struct StickerPageView: View {
       @State private var page = StickerPage()
       let title: String
   
       init(title: String) {
           // `title` won't have any effect
           // this also won't compile with @State macro
           self.page = StickerPage(title: title)
           self.title = title
       }
   }
  ```

  When assigning initial value via an initializer, do not provide an initial value at the @State declaration.

  ```
   struct StickerPageView: View {
       @State private var page: StickerPage // no initial value expression
       let title: String
   
       init(title: String) {
           self.page = StickerPage(title: title) // works!
           self.title = title
       }
   }
  ```

  When all stored members of a struct are private, the compiler synthesizes a private init that can be used in an extension of the same type:

  ```
   struct StickerPageView: View {
       @State private var page: StickerPage
       private let title: String
       ...
   }
   
   extension StickerPageView {
       init(title: String, _ page: StickerPage) {
           self.init(page: page, title: title) // using the synthesized init
       }
   }
  ```

  The state macro disables this synthesized initializer. So the code above no longer compiles. To mitigate, assign value to members explicitly:

  ```
   extension StickerPageView {
       init(title: String, _ page: StickerPage) {
           self.title = title
           self.page = page
       }
   }
  ```

  In rare situations, the automatic inference of generic arguments of `@State` is less flexible with the macro implementation. Write the type with more specificity.

  Composing `@State` with other property wrappers or macros is not supported.  (105893279)
- The `TabsPickerStyle` style is now available for pickers that represent tab-based navigation and content selection. This style is similar to the `.segmented` style, but VoiceOver reads it as “tabs,” and on macOS it has a distinct visual appearance that distinguishes it from pickers that represent value selection — for example, a text alignment picker in an inspector.  (173211711)
- You can now use the `TextInputBorderShape` type to customize the border shape of text input controls like `TextField` with the `textInputBorderShape(_:)` view modifier. The `.squareBorder` and `.roundedBorder` text field styles are soft deprecated — use the new `.bordered` text field style instead.  (173362083)
- In apps built with the 27.0 SDKs, a `LabeledContent` view used inside a `Menu` maps its value to the platform menu item’s subtitle.  (175594929)
- The @Entry macro now warns of potential issues if you store default class instances or closures in the environment. The SwiftUI Specialist skill in Xcode provides guidance for resolving these issues.  (175902616)
- You can now access `concentricCornerRadii` and `concentricCornerRadii(in:)` on `GeometryProxy`. These APIs return the corner radii that are concentric with the view’s container shape as a `RectangleCornerRadii?`. You can use these values to drive custom drawing or layout that responds to the container’s corners without rendering a `ConcentricRectangle` directly.  (177185166)
- `@ContentBuilder` type checking performance is further improved for valid code compared to Beta 1.  (177526032)
- The new data item or error object based `alert` and `confirmationDialog` modifiers can now be used by projects targeting iOS 15.0, macOS 12.0, tvOS 15.0, watchOS 8.0, and visionOS 1.0.  (179388848)

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: When you apply both `.fileExporter(_:...)` and `.fileMover(_:...)` modifiers to a view, some dialogs might not present correctly.  (154080867)
- Fixed: In apps built with the 27.0 SDKs, `containerRelativeFrame(_:alignment:)` incorrectly accounts for safe-area insets on a `ScrollView`’s non-scrollable axis, causing the calculated scrollable content size to be too small. For example, a view using `containerRelativeFrame(.vertical)` inside a horizontal `ScrollView` extends into vertical safe-area regions, such as the navigation bar and home indicator, because only the scrollable axis insets are applied.  (165913417)
- Fixed: Certain control-related view modifiers unexpectedly affect sheet and popover content. In apps built with the 27.0 SDKs, the `controlSize`, `buttonSizing`, `buttonRepeatBehavior`, `menuIndicatorVisibility`, and `ButtonBorderShape` environment values are now reset to their default values in sheets and popovers.  (167448274)
- Fixed: `Menu` labels cannot contain controls, views with gestures, or view representables with gesture recognizers.  (169091260)
- Fixed: Buttons on tvOS no longer automatically use the accent color from an app’s asset catalog as a label tint color when building against the tvOS 27 SDK.  (171830912)
- Fixed: A Button containing both an icon and a title placed inside a `List` `Section` header or footer has incorrect spacing between its icon and title.  (175681345)
- Fixed: `@State` variable named using a raw identifier fails to compile.  (179149051) (FB23015259)

<a id="System"></a>

### System

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- System now provides Swift APIs for the C `stat`, `lstat`, `fstat`, and `fstatat` system calls. This includes a new `Stat` type with initializers from `FilePath`, `FileDescriptor`, or a C string; `FilePath.stat()` and `FileDescriptor.stat()` instance methods; and supporting types (`FileType`, `FileMode`, `FileFlags`, `UserID`, `GroupID`, `DeviceID`, and `Inode`). See [SYS-0006](https://github.com/apple/swift-system/blob/main/Proposals/0006-system-stat.md) for more details.  (160612181)

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: Custom `FilePath` or `FileDescriptor` extensions that make unqualified calls to `stat()` or `stat(_)` (without the `Darwin.` qualification) might conflict with the new Swift `stat()` instance methods introduced in [SYS-0006](https://github.com/apple/swift-system/blob/main/Proposals/0006-system-stat.md), causing build errors. See [SYS-0008](https://github.com/apple/swift-system/blob/main/Proposals/0008-backdeploy-cinterop-stat.md) for more details.  (177911316)

(161843040)

<a id="Deprecations"></a>

#### Deprecations

- Apps built with the latest SDK must adopt the scene-based life cycle or they fail to launch. For migration guidance, see [Transitioning to the UIKit scene-based life cycle](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/transitioning-to-the-uikit-scene-based-life-cycle).  (141837548)
