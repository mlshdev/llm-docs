**Framework:** TV Services

```

## Discussion

> **Important**

>  To create a [TVUserManager](../tvusermanager.md) object, add the [User Management Entitlement](../../bundleresources/entitlements/com.apple.developer.user-management.md) to your app or app extension, and select the Runs as Current User, Only When User-Independent Keychain is Available option.

Some apps rely on profiles to maintain separate information for each person who uses a shared device, such as a video content app that retains which shows they watch. To avoid interrupting people with a profile picker each time they launch your app, you can save the current user’s selection on a shared device. After someone selects a profile, use [shouldStorePreferencesForCurrentUser](shouldstorepreferencesforcurrentuser.md) to determine whether to retain the profile selection or to prompt each time your app launches. This property might be [false](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false) if people share a device, but don’t configure multiple users on that device.

If the property’s value is [false](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false), display the profile picker to determine which profile to use for the current session, but don’t save the selected profile. If the value is [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true), and there isn’t a saved profile in [UserDefaults](../../foundation/userdefaults.md), display the profile picker and save the selected profile for future use. If the value is [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true) and there’s already a saved profile, skip the prompt and use the saved profile.

> **Tip**

>  When your app runs in tvOS 15 or earlier, where [shouldStorePreferencesForCurrentUser](shouldstorepreferencesforcurrentuser.md) isn’t available, display the profile picker at the beginning of each session.
