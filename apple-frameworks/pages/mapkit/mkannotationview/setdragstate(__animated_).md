# setDragState(\_:animated:) (Swift)

**Framework:** MapKit  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 4.2+ · iPadOS 4.2+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.9+ · visionOS 1.0+

Sets the drag state for the annotation view.

## Declaration

```swift
func setDragState(_ newDragState: MKAnnotationView.DragState, animated: Bool)
```

## Parameters

- `newDragState`: The new drag state for the annotation view.
- `animated`: If [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true), the map view animates the change to the new drag state; otherwise, the map view makes the change without animations.

## Discussion

Apps can override this method and use it to implement drag support for custom annotation views. As the system detects user actions that indicate a drag, it calls this method to update the drag state. In response to these changes, your custom implementation of this method needs to do the following:

- When the drag state changes to [MKAnnotationView.DragState.starting](dragstate-swift.enum/starting.md), set the state to [MKAnnotationView.DragState.dragging](dragstate-swift.enum/dragging.md). If you perform an animation to indicate the beginning of a drag, and the `animated` parameter is [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true), perform that animation before changing the state.
- When the state changes to either [MKAnnotationView.DragState.canceling](dragstate-swift.enum/canceling.md) or [MKAnnotationView.DragState.ending](dragstate-swift.enum/ending.md), set the state to [MKAnnotationView.DragState.none](dragstate-swift.enum/none.md). If you perform an animation at the end of a drag, and the `animated` parameter is [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true), perform that animation before changing the state.

The default implementation of this method sets the value of the [dragState](dragstate-swift.property.md) property to the value in the `newDragState` parameter only. Therefore, direct subclasses can call the inherited version of this method to change the drag state; otherwise, change the value in the [isDraggable](isdraggable.md) property directly.

Changing the state to [MKAnnotationView.DragState.dragging](dragstate-swift.enum/dragging.md) or [MKAnnotationView.DragState.none](dragstate-swift.enum/none.md) is the way to signal to the map view when you finish performing animations. For example, when a drag operation begins for an annotation, the class executes an animation to lift the view off the map. Similarly, when the user drops the annotation, the class performs a drop animation. Even if you don’t perform any animations, call the inherited version of this method to update the [dragState](dragstate-swift.property.md) property.

Don’t try to stop a new drag operation by changing the state from [MKAnnotationView.DragState.starting](dragstate-swift.enum/starting.md) to [MKAnnotationView.DragState.none](dragstate-swift.enum/none.md). If you don’t want your annotation view to be draggable, set the [isDraggable](isdraggable.md) property to [false](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false).
