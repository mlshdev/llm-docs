# detectConflicts(for:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Data  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 3.0+ · iPadOS 3.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.4+ · tvOS · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

Marks an object for conflict detection.

## Declaration

```swift
func detectConflicts(for object: NSManagedObject)
```

## Parameters

- `object`: A managed object.

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

If on the next invocation of [save()](save%28%29.md)     `object` has been modified in its persistent store, the save fails. This allows optimistic locking for unchanged objects. Conflict detection is always performed on changed or deleted objects.

### Handling managed objects

- [shouldDeleteInaccessibleFaults](shoulddeleteinaccessiblefaults.md): A Boolean value that determines whether the context turns inaccessible faults into deleted objects.
- [insertedObjects](insertedobjects.md): The set of objects that have been inserted into the context but not yet saved in a persistent store.
- [updatedObjects](updatedobjects.md): The set of objects registered with the context that have uncommitted changes.
- [deletedObjects](deletedobjects.md): The set of objects that will be removed from their persistent store during the next save operation.
- [shouldHandleInaccessibleFault(\_:for:triggeredByProperty:)](shouldhandleinaccessiblefault%28__for_triggeredbyproperty_%29.md): Creates a log of the inaccessible fault.
- [insert(\_:)](insert%28__%29.md): Registers an object to be inserted in the context’s persistent store the next time changes are saved.
- [delete(\_:)](delete%28__%29.md): Specifies an object that should be removed from its persistent store when changes are committed.
- [assign(\_:to:)](assign%28__to_%29.md): Specifies the store in which a newly inserted object will be saved.
- [obtainPermanentIDs(for:)](obtainpermanentids%28for_%29.md): Converts to permanent IDs the object IDs of the objects in a given array.
- [refresh(\_:mergeChanges:)](refresh%28__mergechanges_%29.md): Updates the persistent properties of a managed object to use the latest values from the persistent store.
- [processPendingChanges()](processpendingchanges%28%29.md): Forces the context to process changes to the object graph.
- [observeValue(forKeyPath:of:change:context:)](observevalue%28forkeypath_of_change_context_%29.md): Allows a context that has registered as an observer of a value to be notified of a change to that value.
