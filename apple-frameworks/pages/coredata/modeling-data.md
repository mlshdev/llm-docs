## Overview

A data model holds information about your application’s objects and the graph of how objects relate to each other. You provide this information in your project’s `.xcdatamodeld` file package. To add a data model to your project, see [Creating a Core Data model](creating-a-core-data-model.md).

This screenshot shows the data model for an app that displays a feed of earthquake data.

Model your data by describing your objects as entities, adding their properties as attributes and relationships, and finally generating respective [NSManagedObject](nsmanagedobject.md) subclasses to inherit change tracking and life cycle management.
