# relationshipKeyPathsForPrefetching (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Data  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 3.0+ · iPadOS 3.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.5+ · tvOS · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

The relationship key paths to prefetch along with the entity for the request.

## Declaration

```swift
var relationshipKeyPathsForPrefetching: [String]? { get set }
```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

This property is an array of relationship key-path strings in NSKeyValueCoding notation (as you typically use with [value(forKeyPath:)](../../objectivec/nsobject-swift.class/value%28forkeypath_%29.md)). The default value is an empty array (no prefetching).

Prefetching allows Core Data to obtain related objects in a single fetch (per entity), rather than incurring subsequent access to the store for each individual record as their faults are tripped. For example, given an Employee entity with a relationship to a Department entity, suppose you fetch all the employees, and then for each print out their name and the name of the department to which they belong. In this case, a fault might be fired for each individual Department object. This can represent a significant overhead. You can avoid this by prefetching the department relationship in the Employee fetch, as illustrated in Listing 1.

**Swift**

```swift
let request = NSFetchRequest(entityName: "Employee") as NSFetchRequest<NSManagedObject>
request.relationshipKeyPathsForPrefetching = ["department"]
```

**Objective-C**

```objc
NSFetchRequest *request = [NSFetchRequest fetchRequestWithEntityName:@"Employee"];
[request setRelationshipKeyPathsForPrefetching:@[@"department"]];
```
