# willTurnIntoFault() (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Data  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 3.0+ · iPadOS 3.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.5+ · tvOS · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

Provides an opportunity to add code into the life cycle of the managed object before converting it to a fault.

## Declaration

```swift
func willTurnIntoFault()
```

## Discussion

This method is the companion of the [didTurnIntoFault()](didturnintofault%28%29.md) method. You can use it to (re)set state which requires access to property values (for example, observers across key paths). The default implementation does nothing.
