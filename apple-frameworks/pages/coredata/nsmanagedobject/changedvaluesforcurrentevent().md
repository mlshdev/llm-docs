# changedValuesForCurrentEvent() (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Data  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 5.0+ · iPadOS 5.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.7+ · tvOS · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

Returns a dictionary containing the keys and new values of persistent properties with changes since the last fetching or saving of the managed object.

## Declaration

```swift
func changedValuesForCurrentEvent() -> [String : Any]
```

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

A dictionary with keys that are the names of persistent properties with changes since the last posting of [NSManagedObjectContextObjectsDidChange](../../foundation/nsnotification/name-swift.struct/nsmanagedobjectcontextobjectsdidchange.md), and with the new values for those properties.

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

This method only reports changes to properties that are persistent properties of the receiver, not changes to transient properties or custom instance variables.

> **Note**

> In Objective-C, this method returns the keys and values of persistent properties with changes since the last posting of [NSManagedObjectContextObjectsDidChangeNotification](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/nsmanagedobjectcontextobjectsdidchangenotification).
