## Overview

An `IOHIDInterface` object represents a specific interface of the HID device. Typically, you don’t create `IOHIDInterface` objects directly. Instead, you specify that your driver relies on an `IOHIDInterface` as its provider, and the system creates the interface object for you during the matching process.

To use a HID interface object directly, call [Open](iohidinterface/open.md) to create a new session between the interface and your custom driver. When calling that method, you specify an [OSAction](../driverkit/osaction.md) object to execute each time a new report is ready to process. When a new report arrives, the `IOHIDInterface` object parses the device’s report data, puts the data into a set of [IOHIDElement](iohidelement.md) objects, and notifies your action object. Use your action object’s [ReportAvailable](iohidinterface/reportavailable.md) method to parse the element objects and dispatch events.

## Topics

### Running the Interface

- [init](iohidinterface/init.md): Handles the basic initialization of the interface.
- [free](iohidinterface/free.md)

### Managing the Session

- [Open](iohidinterface/open.md): Opens a session to the device and begins the delivery of input reports.
- [Close](iohidinterface/close.md): Closes the interface and stops the delivery of input reports.

### Getting and Setting Input Reports

- [ReportAvailable](iohidinterface/reportavailable.md): Notifies the interface that an updated report is available from the HID device.
- [AddReportToPool](iohidinterface/addreporttopool.md): Adds a memory descriptor to the report pool.
- [processReport](iohidinterface/processreport.md): Parses the contents of the specified report and updates the interface’s elements.
- [GetReport](iohidinterface/getreport.md): Retrieves a new input report from the HID device.
- [SetReport](iohidinterface/setreport.md): Sends a report to the HID device.

### Accessing the Elements of a Report

- [getElements](iohidinterface/getelements.md): Returns the array of elements that the interface uses to store parsed report data.
- [commitElements](iohidinterface/commitelements.md): Gets or sets the contents of the interface’s stored elements.

- [IOUserUSBHostHIDDevice](iouserusbhosthiddevice.md): A provider object for USB devices that support HID interactions.
- [IOUserHIDDevice](iouserhiddevice.md): A provider object for devices that support interactions with users.
- [IOHIDDevice](iohiddevice.md): An object containing the low-level behavior for all HID device providers.
