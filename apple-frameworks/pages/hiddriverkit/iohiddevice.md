## Overview

`IOHIDDevice` is the abstract base class for provider objects that represent a human interface device. This class defines the basic interface that subclasses use to manage reports. Don’t create instances of this class directly. Instead, subclass [IOUserHIDDevice](iouserhiddevice.md) or [IOUserUSBHostHIDDevice](iouserusbhosthiddevice.md) to define the behavior of your custom device provider.

## Topics

### Processing Device Reports

- [handleReport](iohiddevice/handlereport.md): Handles an asynchronous report received from the HID device.
- [getReport](iohiddevice/getreport.md): Gets a report from the HID device.
- [setReport](iohiddevice/setreport.md): Sends a report to the HID device.
- [CompleteReport](iohiddevice/completereport.md): Completes all async requests made when getting or setting a report.
- [Report Options](report-options-enum.md): The enumerated report options.

### Setting Device Properties

- [setProperty](iohiddevice/setproperty.md): Updates the specified property on the corresponding kernel object.
