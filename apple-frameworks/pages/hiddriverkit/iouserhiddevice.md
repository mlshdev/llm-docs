# IOUserHIDDevice

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** HIDDriverKit  
**Kind:** Class  
**Availability:** DriverKit · macOS

A provider object for devices that support interactions with users.

## Declaration

```objectivec
class IOUserHIDDevice;
```

## Overview

An `IOUserHIDDevice` represents a low-level interface for managing your HID device’s hardware. Subclass `IOUserHIDDevice` when you need to initialize your hardware or set up its transport layer in a specific way. This class provides only basic information about the device, and you are responsible for managing most interactions.

> **Note**

>  Subclass [IOUserUSBHostHIDDevice](iouserusbhosthiddevice.md), instead of this class, when you want to customize Apple’s default implementation for USB-based HID devices.

### Specify the Driver’s Personality Information

When you subclass `IOUserHIDDevice`, update the `IOKitPersonalities` key of your driver extension’s `Info.plist` file with information to match your driver to appropriate hardware. For this class, always include the keys and values in the following table.

| Key | Discussion |
| --- | --- |
| `IOClass` | The value `AppleUserHIDDevice`. |
| `IOProviderClass` | The provider class information. For a USB-based HID device, specify [IOUSBHostInterface](../usbdriverkit/iousbhostinterface.md). |
| `IOUserClass` | The name of your custom subclass. |
| [CFBundleIdentifier](../bundleresources/information-property-list/cfbundleidentifier.md) | The bundle identifier of your driver. |

You may add other keys to assist with the matching process. For example, you might include the `VendorID`, `ProductID`, `PrimaryUsagePage`, and `PrimaryUsage` keys to match against specific USB devices and HID usage types. The USB specification defines which keys to include when matching your driver to a USB device. For information about the specific key combinations, see *Universal Serial Bus Common Class Specification* at [https://www.usb.org](https://www.usb.org).
