# IOUserUSBHostHIDDevice

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** HIDDriverKit  
**Kind:** Class  
**Availability:** DriverKit · macOS

A provider object for USB devices that support HID interactions.

## Declaration

```objectivec
class IOUserUSBHostHIDDevice;
```

## Overview

An `IOUserUSBHostHIDDevice` object is a fully functional provider object that represents a USB-based HID device. Typically, you don’t create `IOUserUSBHostHIDDevice` objects directly. Instead, you specify that your driver relies on an `IOUserUSBHostHIDDevice` as its provider, and the system creates the interface object for you during the matching process.

When implementing a custom driver, use this provider object to manage the connection to the underlying device. Specifically, use it to get reports from the device and to manage the device’s configuration. For example, use the object to configure the USB device’s idle policy.

Subclass `IOUserUSBHostHIDDevice` only when you want to customize the interactions with the USB device. For example, you might use a custom subclass to initialize the USB device in a particular way or support a custom transport mechanism. You can also use a custom subclass to perform additional processing on the report data.

### Specify the Driver’s Personality Information

When you subclass `IOUserUSBHostHIDDevice`, update the `IOKitPersonalities` key of your driver extension’s `Info.plist` file with information to match your driver to appropriate hardware. For this class, always include the keys and values in the following table.

| Key | Discussion |
| --- | --- |
| `IOClass` | The value `AppleUserHIDDevice`. |
| `IOProviderClass` | The provider class information. For a USB-based HID device, specify [IOUSBHostInterface](../usbdriverkit/iousbhostinterface.md). |
| `IOUserClass` | The name of your custom subclass. |
| [CFBundleIdentifier](../bundleresources/information-property-list/cfbundleidentifier.md) | The bundle identifier of your driver. |

You may add other keys to assist with the matching process. For example, you might include the `VendorID`, `ProductID`, `PrimaryUsagePage`, and `PrimaryUsage` keys to match against specific USB devices and HID usage types. The USB specification defines which keys to include when matching your driver to a USB device. For information about the specific key combinations, see *Universal Serial Bus Common Class Specification* at [https://www.usb.org](https://www.usb.org).
