# status

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** App Store Receipts  
**Kind:** Type  
**Availability:** App Store Receipts 1.0+ (deprecated in 1.7)

The status of the app receipt.

## Declaration

```
int status
```

## Possible Values

- `21000`: The request to the App Store didn’t use the HTTP POST request method.
- `21001`: The App Store no longer sends this status code.
- `21002`: The data in the `receipt-data` property is malformed or the service experienced a temporary issue. Try again.
- `21003`: The system couldn’t authenticate the receipt.
- `21004`: The shared secret you provided doesn’t match the shared secret on file for your account.
- `21005`: The receipt server was temporarily unable to provide the receipt. Try again.
- `21006`: This receipt is valid, but the subscription is in an expired state. When your server receives this status code, the system also decodes and returns receipt data as part of the response. This status only returns for iOS 6-style transaction receipts for auto-renewable subscriptions.
- `21007`: This receipt is from the test environment, but you sent it to the production environment for verification.
- `21008`: This receipt is from the production environment, but you sent it to the test environment for verification.
- `21009`: Internal data access error. Try again later.
- `21010`: The system can’t find the user account or the user account has been deleted.

## Discussion

The [verifyReceipt](verify-receipt.md) endpoint returns this field in the JSON response, [responseBody](responsebody.md).

The value for `status` is `0` if the receipt is valid, or a status code if there’s an error. The status code reflects the status of the app receipt as a whole. For example, if you send a valid app receipt that contains an expired subscription, the response is `0` because the receipt is valid.

Status codes `21100–21199` are various internal data access errors.
