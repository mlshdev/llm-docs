# Validating receipts on the device

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** App Store Receipts  
**Kind:** Article

Verify the contents of app receipts by decoding and parsing the receipt on the device.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

When users install apps from the App Store, the app contains a cryptographically signed receipt that Apple creates and stores inside the app bundle, which you can then validate.

> **Note**

>  The receipt isn’t necessary if you use [AppTransaction](../storekit/apptransaction.md) to validate the app download, or [Transaction](../storekit/transaction.md) to validate in-app purchases. Only use the receipt if your app uses the [Original API for In-App Purchase](../storekit/original-api-for-in-app-purchase.md), or needs the receipt to validate the app download because it can’t use [AppTransaction](../storekit/apptransaction.md).

Validating the receipt locally requires you to develop or use code to read and decode the receipt as a PKCS #7 container, as defined by [RFC 2315](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2315). The App Store encodes the payload of the container using Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1), as defined by [ITU-T X.690](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.690/). The payload contains a set of receipt attributes. Each receipt attribute contains a type, a version, and a value.

The App Store defines the structure of the payload with the following ASN.1 notation:

```other
ReceiptModule DEFINITIONS ::=
BEGIN

ReceiptAttribute ::= SEQUENCE {
    type    INTEGER,
    version INTEGER,
    value   OCTET STRING
}

Payload ::= SET OF ReceiptAttribute

END
```

### Validate the receipt

In macOS and Mac apps built with Mac Catalyst, implement receipt validation in the main function, before the app calls [NSApplicationMain(\_:\_:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsapplicationmain%28_:_:%29).

To validate the app receipt, perform the following tests in order:

1. Locate and load the app receipt from the app’s bundle. The class [Bundle](../foundation/bundle.md) provides the location of the receipt with the property [appStoreReceiptURL](../foundation/bundle/appstorereceipturl.md).
2. Decode the app receipt as a PKCS #7 container and verify that the chain of trust for the container’s signature traces back to the Apple Inc. Root certificate, available from [Apple PKI](https://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/). Use the `receipt_creation_date`, identified as [ASN.1 Field Type 12](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/releasenotes/General/ValidateAppStoreReceipt/Chapters/ReceiptFields.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010573-CH106-SW1) when validating the receipt signature.
3. Verify that the bundle identifier, identified as [ASN.1 Field Type 2](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/releasenotes/General/ValidateAppStoreReceipt/Chapters/ReceiptFields.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010573-CH106-SW1), matches your app’s bundle identifier.
4. Verify that the version identifier string, identified as [ASN.1 Field Type 3](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/releasenotes/General/ValidateAppStoreReceipt/Chapters/ReceiptFields.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010573-CH106-SW1), matches the version string in your app’s bundle.
5. Compute a SHA-1 hash for the device that installs the app and verify that it matches the receipt’s hash, identified as [ASN.1 Field Type 5](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/releasenotes/General/ValidateAppStoreReceipt/Chapters/ReceiptFields.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010573-CH106-SW1).

The validation passes if all of the tests pass. If any test fails, the validation fails.

For information about the keys in a receipt, see [Receipt Fields](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/releasenotes/General/ValidateAppStoreReceipt/Chapters/ReceiptFields.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010573-CH106-SW1).

<a id="Verify-the-certificate-chain-of-trust"></a>

### Verify the certificate chain of trust

Decode the app receipt as a PKCS #7 container and verify that the chain of trust for the container’s signature traces back to the Apple Inc. Root certificate, available from [Apple PKI](https://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/).

> **Tip**

>  Don’t hardcode intermediate certificates in your app. Ensure that your code supports certificates that use SHA-256 and SHA-1 signing algorithms.

Make sure your app uses the date from the `receipt_creation_date` field, identified as [ASN.1 Field Type 12](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/releasenotes/General/ValidateAppStoreReceipt/Chapters/ReceiptFields.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010573-CH106-SW1), to validate the receipt’s signature. Many cryptographic libraries default to using the device’s current time and date when validating a PKCS #7 package, but this may not produce the correct results when validating a receipt’s signature. For example, if the receipt was signed with a valid certificate, but the certificate has since expired, using the device’s current date incorrectly returns an invalid result.

<a id="Compute-the-SHA-1-hash"></a>

### Compute the SHA-1 hash

Compute the SHA-1 hash to match the local device with the device hash inside the App Store reciept. When computing the SHA-1 hash, use the platform-specific data source. The source of bytes for each platform is:

- watchOS: Use the raw bytes from the [uuid](../foundation/uuid/uuid.md) property of the [UUID](../foundation/uuid.md) that [identifierForVendor](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/wkinterfacedevice/identifierforvendor) provides.
- iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, and iOS apps running on a Mac with Apple silicon: Use the raw bytes from the [uuid](../foundation/uuid/uuid.md) property of the [UUID](../foundation/uuid.md) that [identifierForVendor](../uikit/uidevice/identifierforvendor.md) provides.
- macOS and apps built with Mac Catalyst: Use the data that returns from `copy_mac_address` from the example code below.

The following two code examples illustrate how to retrieve an identifier in macOS, as the `copy_mac_address` function shows, for validating an App Store receipt.

In the following Swift code, the `io_service` function uses [IOKit](../iokit.md) to retrieve network interfaces as an optional [IOKit](../iokit.md) object. The `copy_mac_address` function looks up an appropriate network interface and returns the hardware address from the [IOKit](../iokit.md) object as optional `CFData`.

```swift
import IOKit
import Foundation

// Returns an object with a +1 retain count; the caller needs to release.
func io_service(named name: String, wantBuiltIn: Bool) -> io_service_t? {
    let default_port = kIOMasterPortDefault
    var iterator = io_iterator_t()
    defer {
        if iterator != IO_OBJECT_NULL {
            IOObjectRelease(iterator)
        }
    }

    guard let matchingDict = IOBSDNameMatching(default_port, 0, name),
        IOServiceGetMatchingServices(default_port,
                                     matchingDict as CFDictionary,
                                     &iterator) == KERN_SUCCESS,
        iterator != IO_OBJECT_NULL
    else {
        return nil
    }

    var candidate = IOIteratorNext(iterator)
    while candidate != IO_OBJECT_NULL {
        if let cftype = IORegistryEntryCreateCFProperty(candidate,
                                                        "IOBuiltin" as CFString,
                                                        kCFAllocatorDefault,
                                                        0) {
            let isBuiltIn = cftype.takeRetainedValue() as! CFBoolean
            if wantBuiltIn == CFBooleanGetValue(isBuiltIn) {
                return candidate
            }
        }

        IOObjectRelease(candidate)
        candidate = IOIteratorNext(iterator)
    }

    return nil
}

func copy_mac_address() -> CFData? {
    // Prefer built-in network interfaces.
    // For example, an external Ethernet adaptor can displace
    // the built-in Wi-Fi as en0.
    guard let service = io_service(named: "en0", wantBuiltIn: true)
            ?? io_service(named: "en1", wantBuiltIn: true)
            ?? io_service(named: "en0", wantBuiltIn: false)
        else { return nil }
    defer { IOObjectRelease(service) }

    if let cftype = IORegistryEntrySearchCFProperty(
        service,
        kIOServicePlane,
        "IOMACAddress" as CFString,
        kCFAllocatorDefault,
        IOOptionBits(kIORegistryIterateRecursively | kIORegistryIterateParents)) {
            return (cftype as! CFData)
    }

    return nil
}
```

The following Objective-C code works in the same fashion. This example uses [IOKit](../iokit.md) to look up the relevant network interface, and returns the bytes that identify the built-in network interface:

```objc
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
#import <IOKit/network/IONetworkLib.h>

io_service_t io_service(const char *name, BOOL wantBuiltIn) {
    io_iterator_t iterator = IO_OBJECT_NULL;
    mach_port_t default_port = kIOMasterPortDefault;
    io_service_t service = IO_OBJECT_NULL;

    if (KERN_SUCCESS != IOMasterPort(MACH_PORT_NULL, &default_port)) {
        return IO_OBJECT_NULL;
    }

    CFMutableDictionaryRef matchingDict = IOBSDNameMatching(default_port,
                                                            0,
                                                            name);
    if (matchingDict == NULL) {
        return IO_OBJECT_NULL;
    }

    if (KERN_SUCCESS != IOServiceGetMatchingServices(default_port,
                                                     matchingDict,
                                                     &iterator)) {
        return IO_OBJECT_NULL;
    }

    if (iterator != IO_OBJECT_NULL) {
        io_service_t candidate = IOIteratorNext(iterator);
        while (candidate != IO_OBJECT_NULL) {
            CFTypeRef isBuiltIn =
            IORegistryEntryCreateCFProperty(candidate,
                                            CFSTR(kIOBuiltin),
                                            kCFAllocatorDefault,
                                            0);
            if (isBuiltIn != NULL && CFGetTypeID(isBuiltIn) == CFBooleanGetTypeID()) {
                if (wantBuiltIn == CFBooleanGetValue(isBuiltIn)) {
                    service = candidate;
                    break;
                }
            }

            IOObjectRelease(candidate);
            candidate = IOIteratorNext(iterator);
        }
        IOObjectRelease(iterator);
    }

    return service;
}

CFDataRef copy_mac_address() {
    CFDataRef macAddress = NULL;
    io_service_t service = io_service("en0", true);

    if (service == IO_OBJECT_NULL) {
        service = io_service("en1", true);
    }

    if (service == IO_OBJECT_NULL) {
        service = io_service("en0", false);
    }

    if (service != IO_OBJECT_NULL) {
        CFTypeRef property =
        IORegistryEntrySearchCFProperty(service,
                                        kIOServicePlane,
                                        CFSTR(kIOMACAddress),
                                        kCFAllocatorDefault,
                                        kIORegistryIterateRecursively | kIORegistryIterateParents);
        if (property != NULL) {
            if (CFGetTypeID(property) == CFDataGetTypeID()) {
                macAddress = property;
            }
            else {
                CFRelease(property);
            }
        }

        IOObjectRelease(service);
    }

    return macAddress;

### Respond to validation failures

If your app receipt validation fails, respond to that failure as follows:

- Don’t try to terminate the app. Without a validated receipt, assume the user doesn’t have access to premium content. Provide a user interface to gracefully handle this case and inform the user what they can do to get full access to your app’s features.
- If the app receipt is missing or corrupt, use the [SKReceiptRefreshRequest](../storekit/skreceiptrefreshrequest.md) object to refresh the app receipt.
- In the sandbox environment, if the app receipt is missing, assume the tester is a new customer and doesn’t have access to premium content.

> **Note**

>  For apps in iOS and iPadOS running in the sandbox environment and in StoreKit testing in Xcode, the app receipt is present only after the tester makes their first in-app purchase. The app receipt is always present in TestFlight on devices running macOS.
