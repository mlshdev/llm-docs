This field is present only if an auto-renewable subscription is in the billing retry state. See [is_in_billing_retry_period](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstorereceipts/responsebody/pending_renewal_info-data.dictionary/is_in_billing_retry_period) for more information.

- `original_transaction_id` — `original_transaction_id`: The transaction identifier of the original purchase.
- `price_consent_status` — `string`: The price consent status for an auto-renewable subscription price increase that requires customer consent. This field is present only if the App Store requested customer consent for a price increase that requires customer consent. The default value is `"0"` and changes to `"1"` if the customer consents.
  **Allowed values:** `1`, `0`
- `product_id` — `string`: The unique identifier of the product purchased. You provide this value when creating the product in App Store Connect, and it corresponds to the `productIdentifier` property of the [SKPayment](../../storekit/skpayment.md) object stored in the transaction’s payment property.

- `price_increase_status` — `string`: The status that indicates if an auto-renewable subscription is subject to a price increase.

  The price increase status is `"0"` when the App Store has requested consent for an auto-renewable subscription price increase that requires customer consent, and the customer hasn’t yet consented.

  The price increase status is `"1"` if the customer has consented to a price increase that requires customer consent.

  The price increase status is also `"1"` if the App Store has notified the customer of the auto-renewable subscription price increase that doesn’t require customer consent.

## Discussion

In the JSON file, `pending_renewal_info` is an array in which each element contains the pending renewal information for each auto-renewable subscription identified by the `product_id`. A pending renewal may refer to a renewal that the system scheduled in the future or a renewal that failed in the past for some reason.

Use this value to get critical information about any pending renewal transactions for an auto-renewable subscription.

The `pending_renewal_info` array is returned only for app receipts that contain auto-renewable subscriptions. If customers voluntarily cancel a subscription renewal while in the grace period, the App Store pauses billing retry, and removes the transaction from `pending_renewal_info`. The subscription is in the grace period if the key `grace_period_expires_date_ms` is present and the expiration date hasn’t passed.
