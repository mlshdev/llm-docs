# matrix4x4h

**Framework:** Compute Graph  
**Kind:** Namespace  
**Availability:** macOS · Reality Composer Pro

Transform positions and directions using matrix4x4h.

## Topics

### Functions

- [matrix4x4h::transformDirection](matrix4x4h/transformdirection.md): Transforms a half-precision direction vector by a 4x4 matrix, ignoring translation.
- [matrix4x4h::transformPosition](matrix4x4h/transformposition.md): Transforms a half-precision position by a 4x4 matrix, including translation.

### Built-in nodes

- [element](element.md): A set of nodes for reading and writing the current element within a particle simulation.
- [emitter](emitter.md): A set of nodes usable in the emission stage of a simulation, which control how often and how many elements to spawn.
- [force](force.md): Apply physics forces including gravity, drag, noise, and twist.
- [initialize](initialize.md): Nodes usable within the initialization stage of an element.
- [output](output.md): Nodes usable within the output stage of an element. You can use these nodes to change the appearance of an element without making modifications to the element itself.
- [module](module.md): Mutate per-particle state with operations such as setPosition, addPosition, setVelocity, setColor, setSize, and setLifetime.
- [graph](graph.md): A set of nodes usable in any stage within a ComputeGraph.
- [group](group.md): Nodes for querying the group for a current particle. Requires a system whose simulation stage is configured as either `strips` or `grouped`.
- [texture](texture.md): Nodes usable within the texture stage, for generating textures.
- [random](random.md): Nodes for generating pseudo-random numbers.
- [matrix4x4f](matrix4x4f.md): Transform positions and directions using matrix4x4f.
