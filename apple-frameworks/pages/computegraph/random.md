- [element](element.md): A set of nodes for reading and writing the current element within a particle simulation.
- [emitter](emitter.md): A set of nodes usable in the emission stage of a simulation, which control how often and how many elements to spawn.
- [force](force.md): Apply physics forces including gravity, drag, noise, and twist.
- [initialize](initialize.md): Nodes usable within the initialization stage of an element.
- [output](output.md): Nodes usable within the output stage of an element. You can use these nodes to change the appearance of an element without making modifications to the element itself.
