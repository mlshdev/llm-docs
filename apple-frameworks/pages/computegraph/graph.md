# graph

**Framework:** Compute Graph  
**Kind:** Namespace  
**Availability:** macOS · Reality Composer Pro

A set of nodes usable in any stage within a ComputeGraph.

## Topics

### Functions

- [graph::age](graph/age.md): Returns the age of the graph in seconds.
- [graph::deltaTime](graph/deltatime.md): Returns the time elapsed since the last frame.
- [graph::localToWorld](graph/localtoworld.md): Returns the transformation matrix from local space to world space.
- [graph::worldToLocal](graph/worldtolocal.md): Returns the transformation matrix from world space to local space.

### Built-in nodes

- [element](element.md): A set of nodes for reading and writing the current element within a particle simulation.
- [emitter](emitter.md): A set of nodes usable in the emission stage of a simulation, which control how often and how many elements to spawn.
- [force](force.md): Apply physics forces including gravity, drag, noise, and twist.
- [initialize](initialize.md): Nodes usable within the initialization stage of an element.
- [output](output.md): Nodes usable within the output stage of an element. You can use these nodes to change the appearance of an element without making modifications to the element itself.
- [module](module.md): Mutate per-particle state with operations such as setPosition, addPosition, setVelocity, setColor, setSize, and setLifetime.
- [group](group.md): Nodes for querying the group for a current particle. Requires a system whose simulation stage is configured as either `strips` or `grouped`.
- [texture](texture.md): Nodes usable within the texture stage, for generating textures.
- [random](random.md): Nodes for generating pseudo-random numbers.
- [matrix4x4f](matrix4x4f.md): Transform positions and directions using matrix4x4f.
- [matrix4x4h](matrix4x4h.md): Transform positions and directions using matrix4x4h.
