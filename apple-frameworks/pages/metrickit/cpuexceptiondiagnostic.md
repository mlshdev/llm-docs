# CPUExceptionDiagnostic

**Framework:** MetricKit  
**Kind:** Structure  
**Availability:** iOS 27.0+ · iPadOS 27.0+ · Mac Catalyst 27.0+ · macOS 27.0+ · visionOS 27.0+

A diagnostic for a fatal or nonfatal CPU exception.

## Declaration

```swift
struct CPUExceptionDiagnostic
```

## Discussion

CPU exceptions occur when your app consumes an excessive amount of CPU time in a short period. The diagnostic includes a [CallStackTree](callstacktree.md) to identify the responsible code path, along with `totalCPUTime` and `totalSampledTime` measurements.

## Topics

### Call stack

- [callStackTree](cpuexceptiondiagnostic/callstacktree.md): The application call stack tree associated with the excessive CPU consumption.

### CPU exception details

- [totalCPUTime](cpuexceptiondiagnostic/totalcputime.md): Total CPU time consumed in the scope of this CPU exception.
- [totalSampledTime](cpuexceptiondiagnostic/totalsampledtime.md): Total time that the application was sampled for during the CPU exception.
