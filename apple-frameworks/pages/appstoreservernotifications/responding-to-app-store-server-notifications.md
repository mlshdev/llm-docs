# Responding to App Store Server Notifications

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** App Store Server Notifications  
**Kind:** Article

Send HTTP status codes to indicate the success of a notification post.

## Overview

When you set up the endpoints on your server to receive notifications, configure your server to send a response. Use HTTP status codes to indicate whether the App Store server notification post succeeded:

- Send HTTP `200`, or any HTTP code between `200` and `206`, if the post was successful.
- Send HTTP `50x` or `40x` to have the App Store retry the notification, if the post didn’t succeed.

The system considers all other HTTP codes an unsuccessful post. Your server isn’t required to return a data value.

If the App Store server doesn’t receive a success response from your server after the initial notification attempt, it retries as follows:

- For version 2 notifications, it retries five times, at 1, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after the previous attempt.
- For version 1 notifications, it retries three times, at 6, 24, and 48 hours after the previous attempt.

> **Note**

>  Retry notifications are available only in the production environment. In the sandbox environment, the App Store server attempts to send the notification one time.

### Recover from server outages

If your server misses notifications due to an outage, you can always get up-to-date transaction information by calling [App Store Server API](../appstoreserverapi.md) endpoints including [Get Transaction History](../appstoreserverapi/get-transaction-history.md) and [Get All Subscription Statuses](../appstoreserverapi/get-all-subscription-statuses.md).

If you use version 2 notifications ([App Store Server Notifications V2](app-store-server-notifications-v2.md)), you can recover missed notifications by calling [Get Notification History](../appstoreserverapi/get-notification-history.md). You can also test whether your server is receiving and responding to version 2 notifications correctly by calling the [Request a Test Notification](../appstoreserverapi/request-a-test-notification.md) endpoint.
