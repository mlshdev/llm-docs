## Discussion

The `signedPayload` is a string of three Base64URL-encoded components, separated by a period. The string contains a JWS representation of the notification response body, signed by the App Store according to the JSON Web Signature (JWS) [IETF RFC 7515](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7515) specification.

The three components of the string are a header, a payload, and a signature, in that order.

To read the notification response body, Base64URL-decode the payload. Use a [responseBodyV2DecodedPayload](responsebodyv2decodedpayload.md) object to read the payload information.

To read the header, Base64URL-decode it and use a [JWSDecodedHeader](jwsdecodedheader.md) object to access the information. Use the information in the decoded header to verify the signature.
