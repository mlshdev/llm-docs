## Discussion

The `signedPayload` object is a JWS representation. To get the transaction and subscription renewal details from the notification payload, process the `signedPayload` as follows:

1. Parse `signedPayload` to identify the JWS header, payload, and signature representations.
2. Base64URL-decode the payload to get the [responseBodyV2DecodedPayload](responsebodyv2decodedpayload.md). The decoded payload contains details of the notification such as the notification type and  data.
3. The `data` object contains a `signedTransactionInfo` ([JWSTransaction](../appstoreserverapi/jwstransaction.md)) and based on the notification type, a `signedRenewalInfo` ([JWSRenewalInfo](jwsrenewalinfo.md)). Parse and Base64URL-decode these signed JWS representations to get transaction and subscription renewal details.

Each of the signed JWS representations, `signedPayload`, `signedTransactionInfo`, and `signedRenewalInfo`, have a JWS signature that you can validate on your server. Use the algorithm specified in the header’s [alg](alg.md) parameter to validate the signature. For more information about validating signatures, see the JSON Web Signature (JWS) [IETF RFC 7515](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7515) specification.
