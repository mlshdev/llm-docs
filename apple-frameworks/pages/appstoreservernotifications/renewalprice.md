## Discussion

This value represents the renewal price, in milliunits of the [currency](currency.md), of the auto-renewable subscription. One unit of the currency equals 1000 milliunits.

If the next billing period includes an offer specified by the [offerIdentifier](offeridentifier.md), the [renewalPrice](renewalprice.md) value reflects the discount.

For more information, see [Download financial reports](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/getting-paid/download-financial-reports) and [Overview of reporting tools](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/measure-app-performance/overview-of-reporting-tools).

To determine the storefront, use the [storefront](storefront.md) value in the transaction. Don’t use the [currency](currency.md) value to infer the storefront.
