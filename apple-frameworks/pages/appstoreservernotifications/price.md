## Discussion

This value represents the price, in milliunits of the [currency](currency.md), of the In-App Purchase that the system records in the transaction. One unit of the currency equals 1000 milliunits.

The [price](price.md) value reflects all of the following:

- The price you configured in App Store Connect, which the system records on the purchase date ([purchaseDate](../appstoreserverapi/purchasedate.md)).
- The discount from an offer in the [offerIdentifier](offeridentifier.md) field, if the transaction includes an offer.
- The [quantity](quantity.md) of a consumable In-App Purchase. The price value shows the total amount of the transaction for the quantity the customer purchased.

The following table shows some examples of the [price](../appstoreserverapi/price.md) and [currency](../appstoreserverapi/currency.md) parameters based on sample prices you might configure in App Store Connect:

| Configured price in App Store Connect | `price` parameter | `currency` parameter |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $1.99 (U.S. dollar) | 1990 | USD |
| KRW 3300 (South Korean won) | 3300000 | KRW |
| JPY 300 (Japanese yen) | 300000 | JPY |

To determine the storefront, use the [storefront](../appstoreserverapi/storefront.md) value in the transaction. Don’t use the [currency](../appstoreserverapi/currency.md) value to infer the storefront.
