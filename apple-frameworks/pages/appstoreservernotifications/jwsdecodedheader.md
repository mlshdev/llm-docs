# JWSDecodedHeader

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** App Store Server Notifications  
**Kind:** Object  
**Availability:** App Store Server Notifications 2.0+

A decoded JSON Web Signature header containing transaction or renewal information.

## Declaration

```
object JWSDecodedHeader
```

## Properties

- `alg` — `alg`: The algorithm used for signing the JSON Web Signature (JWS).
- `x5c` — `x5c`: The X.509 certificate chain that corresponds to the key that the App Store used to secure the JWS.

## Discussion

All JWS representations, including the [signedPayload](signedpayload.md), contain a JWS header. When you Base64 URL-decode the header, use the [JWSDecodedHeader](../appstoreserverapi/jwsdecodedheader.md) object to read its contents. Use the information in the [JWSDecodedHeader](jwsdecodedheader.md) to validate the JWS signature. For more information about validating signatures, see the JSON Web Signature (JWS) [IETF RFC 7515](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7515) specification.

The App Store signs transaction and renewal information that you receive in [App Store Server Notifications V2](app-store-server-notifications-v2.md) and in the [App Store Server API](../appstoreserverapi.md). It uses the following `x5c` certificate chain, in the following order:

1. A certificate that contains the public key that corresponds to the key the App Store uses to digitally sign the JWS. Section 4.11.10 Mac App Store Receipt Signing Certificates of the [Apple Inc. Certificate Practice Statement Worldwide Developer Relations](https://images.apple.com/certificateauthority/pdf/Apple_WWDR_CPS_v1.26.pdf) document defines the custom extensions this certificate uses.
2. An Apple intermediate certificate that contains an extension with the extension ID for `Apple Worldwide Developer Relations (1.2.840.113635.100.6.2.1)`.
3. An Apple root certificate.

For more information, or to download Apple’s root and intermediate certificates, see [Apple PKI](https://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/).

### JWS header types

- [alg](alg.md): The JSON Web Signature (JWS) header parameter that identifies the cryptographic algorithm used to secure the JWS.
- [x5c](x5c.md): The JSON Web Signature (JWS) header parameter that contains the certificate chain that corresponds to the key used to digitally sign the JWS.
