## Discussion

Use the information in the response body to react quickly to changes in your users’ subscription states. The fields available in a notification sent to your server depend on the [notification_type](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreservernotifications/responsebodyv1/notification_type), which indicates the event that triggered the notification.
