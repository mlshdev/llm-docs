# resetHandler (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Haptics  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 14.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

A block that the haptic engine calls after recovering from a haptic server error.

## Declaration

```swift
var resetHandler: CHHapticEngine.ResetHandler { get set }
```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

If the handler has to reset itself after a server failure, the system calls this block asynchronously. In this block, release all haptic pattern players and recreate them. The system preserves [CHHapticPattern](../chhapticpattern.md) objects and [CHHapticEngine](../chhapticengine.md) properties across restarts. Consider trying to restart the engine inside the reset block.

**Swift**

```swift
self.hapticEngine.resetHandler = {
    print("Engine reset --> Restarting!")
    do {
        try self.hapticEngine.start()
    } catch {
        print("Failed to restart the engine: \(error)")
    }
}
```

**Objective-C**

```objc
self.hapticEngine.resetHandler = ^{ 
    NSLog(@"Engine reset --> Restarting!");
    [self.hapticEngine startAndReturnError:&error];
};
```

Callbacks to this block arrive on a non-main thread, so handle them in a thread-safe manner.
