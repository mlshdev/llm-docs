# registerAudioResource(\_:options:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Haptics  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 14.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

Registers an external audio to use as a custom waveform.

## Declaration

```swift
func registerAudioResource(_ resourceURL: URL, options: [AnyHashable : Any] = [:]) throws -> CHHapticAudioResourceID
```

## Parameters

- `resourceURL`: A URL that identifies the location of the audio file to register.
- `options`: A dictionary with audio resource keys and values that describe how to play this resource.

## Return Value

An identifier for the audio resource.

## Discussion

Before you initialize a Core Haptics event with your own audio file, use this method to register the file with the engine. Reference external audio files using a URL.

Input the value that this method returns when creating the dictionary or event representation of a haptic pattern.

> **Note**

>  In an Apple Haptics and Audio File (AHAP), you specify audio files by their path, as opposed to their registered resource URL. For more information, see [Representing haptic patterns in AHAP files](../representing-haptic-patterns-in-ahap-files.md).

## Topics

### Audio Resource Keys

- [CHHapticAudioResourceKeyLoopEnabled](../chhapticaudioresourcekeyloopenabled.md): A key for a Boolean value that indicates whether to loop audio playback.
- [CHHapticAudioResourceKeyUseVolumeEnvelope](../chhapticaudioresourcekeyusevolumeenvelope.md): A key for a Boolean value that indicates whether audio file playback fades in and out using an envelope.
- [CHHapticAudioResourceKey](../chhapticaudioresourcekey.md): A type alias for a key that identifies the playback behavior of an audio resource.

### Registering Audio Resources

- [unregisterAudioResource(\_:)](unregisteraudioresource%28__%29.md): Unregisters an external audio file that you previously registered with the engine.
- [CHHapticAudioResourceID](../chhapticaudioresourceid.md): A type that identifies a custom audio resource.

# registerAudioResource:options:error: (Objective-C)

**Framework:** Core Haptics  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 14.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

Registers an external audio to use as a custom waveform.

## Declaration

```objectivec
- (CHHapticAudioResourceID) registerAudioResource:(NSURL *) resourceURL options:(NSDictionary *) options error:(NSError **) outError;
```

## Parameters

- `resourceURL`: A URL that identifies the location of the audio file to register.
- `options`: A dictionary with audio resource keys and values that describe how to play this resource.
- `outError`: If the operation fails, the system sets this pointer to an [NSError](../../foundation/nserror.md), that describes the failure.
