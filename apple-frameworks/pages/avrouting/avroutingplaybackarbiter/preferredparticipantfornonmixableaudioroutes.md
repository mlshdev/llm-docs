# preferredParticipantForNonMixableAudioRoutes (Swift)

**Framework:** AVRouting  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 27.0+ · iPadOS 27.0+ · Mac Catalyst 27.0+ · tvOS 26.0+

The participant that has priority to play audio when it’s not possible to play multiple audio sources concurrently.

## Declaration

```swift
weak var preferredParticipantForNonMixableAudioRoutes: (any AVRoutingPlaybackParticipant)? { get set }
```

<a id="discussion"></a>

## Discussion

This participant takes precedence over all other participants to play audio in non-mixable audio routes when concurrent audio playback isn’t possible, and only a single participant can play audio. The system unmutes this participant’s audio, and mutes the audio of all other participants.

By default, this value is `nil`. When the current preferred participant finishes, the system sets this value to `nil`. If this value is `nil`, the arbiter doesn’t impose any priority on the participants, and the participant that’s unmuted is based on the existing selection mechanism.
