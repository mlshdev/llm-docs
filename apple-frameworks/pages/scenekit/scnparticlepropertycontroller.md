# SCNParticlePropertyController (Swift)

**Framework:** SceneKit  
**Kind:** Class  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · iPadOS 8.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ (deprecated in 26.0) · macOS 10.8+ (deprecated in 26.0) · tvOS 9.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · visionOS 1.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · watchOS 3.0+ (deprecated in 26.0)

An animation for a single property of the individual particles rendered by a particle system.

## Declaration

```swift
class SCNParticlePropertyController
```

## Overview

Use particle property controllers to change the properties of individual particles in an [SCNParticleSystem](scnparticlesystem.md) object over time, with Core Animation semantics. For example, by associating a keyframe animation with a particle system’s [color](scnparticlesystem/particleproperty/color.md) property, you can create a flame effect with particles that change from blue to white to orange as they rise.

A particle property controller animates a property of individual particles rendered by the particle system. By comparison, implicitly or explicitly animating properties of a [SCNParticleSystem](scnparticlesystem.md) object affects the system as a whole. Consider the keyframe animation of colors described above—if you apply this animation directly to a particle system instead of using a property controller, all particles rendered by the system change color together instead of each one changing color as it rises.

Core Animation animations in SceneKit typically animate a change to a property as a function of time. By default, property controllers animate a particle property this way. However, by changing the [inputMode](scnparticlepropertycontroller/inputmode.md) property you can also create animations that animate a particle property as a function of distance from a specified node or of the value of another particle property. For example, you can use this option to make particles change color as they speed up and slow down.

## Topics

### Creating a Property Controller

- [init(animation:)](scnparticlepropertycontroller/init%28animation_%29.md): Creates a particle property controller with the specified Core Animation animation.

### Managing the Controller’s Animation

- [animation](scnparticlepropertycontroller/animation.md): The Core Animation object defining the behavior of the property animation.
- [inputMode](scnparticlepropertycontroller/inputmode.md): The mode that determines input values for the property controller’s animation.
- [inputBias](scnparticlepropertycontroller/inputbias.md): An offset to add to the input value of the controller’s animation.
- [inputScale](scnparticlepropertycontroller/inputscale.md): A factor for multiplying the input value of the controller’s animation.
- [inputOrigin](scnparticlepropertycontroller/inputorigin.md): A node whose distance to each particle provides input values for the controller’s animation.
- [inputProperty](scnparticlepropertycontroller/inputproperty.md): A particle property that provides input values for this property controller’s animation.

### Constants

- [SCNParticleInputMode](scnparticleinputmode.md): Options for the input value of the property controller’s animation, used by the [inputMode](scnparticlepropertycontroller/inputmode.md) property.
