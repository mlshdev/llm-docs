# SCNSceneSourceStatusHandler (Swift)

**Framework:** SceneKit  
**Kind:** Type Alias  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · iPadOS 8.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ (deprecated in 26.0) · macOS 10.8+ (deprecated in 26.0) · tvOS 9.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · visionOS 1.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · watchOS 3.0+ (deprecated in 26.0)

The signature for the block that SceneKit calls periodically to report progress while loading a scene.

## Declaration

```swift
typealias SCNSceneSourceStatusHandler = (Float, SCNSceneSourceStatus, (any Error)?, UnsafeMutablePointer<ObjCBool>) -> Void
```

## Discussion

You provide a block with this signature when using the [scene(options:statusHandler:)](scnscenesource/scene%28options_statushandler_%29.md) method.

The block takes four parameters:

- **totalProgress**: A floating-point number between `0.0` and `1.0` indicating the overall progress of loading the scene. A value of `0.0` indicates that the loading process has just begun, and a value of `1.0` indicates that the process has completed.
- **status**: A constant identifying one of the distinct phases of SceneKit’s loading procedure. See [SCNSceneSourceStatus](scnscenesourcestatus.md) for possible values.
- **error**: An error object describing any error that has occurred during scene loading, or `nil` if no errors has been encountered.
- **stopLoading**: A reference to a Boolean value. Set `*stop` to [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true) within the block to abort further processing of the scene source’s contents.
