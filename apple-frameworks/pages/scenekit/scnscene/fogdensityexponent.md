# fogDensityExponent (Swift)

**Framework:** SceneKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · iPadOS 8.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ (deprecated in 26.0) · macOS 10.8+ (deprecated in 26.0) · tvOS 9.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · visionOS 1.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · watchOS 3.0+ (deprecated in 26.0)

The transition curve for the fog’s intensity between its start and end distances. Animatable.

## Declaration

```swift
var fogDensityExponent: CGFloat { get set }
```

## Discussion

A fog effect fades out the contents of the scene with increasing distance from the [pointOfView](../scnscenerenderer/pointofview.md) location, replacing them with increasing intensities of the [fogColor](fogcolor.md) color. The [fogDensityExponent](fogdensityexponent.md) property determines the smoothness or abruptness of this transition.

A value of `0.0` (the default) specifies no attenuation—the fog’s intensity is the same at all distances . A value of `1.0` specifies a linear transition, and a value of `2.0` specifies a quadratic transition curve. Higher values have little visible effect.

You can animate changes to this property’s value. See [Animating SceneKit Content](../animating-scenekit-content.md).

- [fogStartDistance](fogstartdistance.md): The distance from a point of view at which the scene’s contents begin to be obscured by fog. Animatable.
- [fogEndDistance](fogenddistance.md): The distance from a point of view at which the scene’s contents are completely obscured by fog. Animatable.
- [fogColor](fogcolor.md): The color of the fog effect to be rendered with the scene. Animatable.
