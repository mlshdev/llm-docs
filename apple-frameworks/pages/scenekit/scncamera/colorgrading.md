# colorGrading (Swift)

**Framework:** SceneKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · iPadOS 8.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ (deprecated in 26.0) · macOS 10.8+ (deprecated in 26.0) · tvOS 9.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · visionOS 1.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · watchOS 3.0+ (deprecated in 26.0)

A texture for applying color grading effects to the entire rendered scene.

## Declaration

```swift
var colorGrading: SCNMaterialProperty { get }
```

## Discussion

The [contents](../scnmaterialproperty/contents.md) value for this material property must be a 3D color lookup table, or a 2D texture image that represents such a table arranged in a horizontal strip.

A lookup table is a cube of color values: the red, green, and blue components of an input color map to the x, y, and z coordinates of a location in that cube, and at that location in the cube is a corresponding output color. You can provide data in this cubic format as a Metal texture with the [MTLTextureType.type3D](../../metal/mtltexturetype/type3d.md) texture type.

The 2D representation of a 3D color cube is an arrangement of slices: for example, a 16 x 16 x 16 color cube becomes a horizontal strip of 16 squares, each 16 x 16 pixels (that is, a 256 x 16 image). Each square contains a gradation of red and green components, and together the 16 squares form a gradation for the blue component. To provide a 2D representation of a color cube, set this material property’s [contents](../scnmaterialproperty/contents.md) value to an image.

By using a color table, you can easily create custom color effects that apply to an entire rendered scene:

1. Create a basic color table image such as [Figure 1](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/scenekit/scncamera/1644114-colorgrading#1965935), where the color value for each R, G, and B coordinate in the cube is the corresponding RGB color.

Apply only effects that affect pixel colors without modifying pixel positions. (For example, you can use hue/saturation, color curves, or color matrix filters, but not blur or distort filters.)

![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.scenekit/media-1965936@2x.png) \3. Apply the same color effect you created in step 2 to your basic color table image. You can even perform these steps together: paste the basic color table into your game screenshot, apply an effect to the combined picture, then crop the picture to just the modified color table. [Figure 2](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/scenekit/scncamera/1644114-colorgrading#1965936) shows an example effect. \4. Assign your customized color table image (such as the example in [Figure 3](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/scenekit/scncamera/1644114-colorgrading#1965937)) to this property. When rendering, SceneKit looks up the RGB values for each pixel in the rendered scene, and displays the corresponding color values from the color table.

To enable this behavior, you must first enable the [wantsHDR](wantshdr.md) setting.
