# fStop (Swift)

**Framework:** SceneKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · iPadOS 8.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ (deprecated in 26.0) · macOS 10.8+ (deprecated in 26.0) · tvOS 9.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · visionOS 1.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · watchOS 3.0+ (deprecated in 26.0)

The physical camera aperture simulated by SceneKit for depth-of-field effects. Animatable.

## Declaration

```swift
var fStop: CGFloat { get set }
```

## Discussion

F-stop numbers describe the light-gathering area of a physical camera’s imaging system, and are typically expressed as the denominator of a ratio including the camera’s focal length ƒ, such as ƒ/2 or ƒ/5.6. A larger denominator indicates a smaller aperture, allowing less light to pass from the camera’s lens through to the imaging plane (sensor or film), and a smaller denominator indicates a larger aperture that lets more light through.

SceneKit uses aperture measurements to simulate depth-of-field blur effects (also called *bokeh*) approximating those produced by a physical camera. A larger [fStop](fstop.md) number (or aperture denominator) causes most of the scene to appear in focus, with extremely close or far depths showing slight blurring; a smaller number results in only a narrow range of depths appearing in focus, and a more pronounced blur effect for the rest of the scene. The default [fStop](fstop.md) value is `5.6`.

You can animate changes to this property’s value. See [Animating SceneKit Content](../animating-scenekit-content.md).
