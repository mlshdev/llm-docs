# renderer(\_:didRenderScene:atTime:) (Swift)

**Framework:** SceneKit  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · iPadOS 8.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ (deprecated in 26.0) · macOS 10.8+ (deprecated in 26.0) · tvOS 9.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · visionOS 1.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · watchOS 3.0+ (deprecated in 26.0)

Tells the delegate that the renderer has rendered the scene.

## Declaration

```swift
optional func renderer(_ renderer: any SCNSceneRenderer, didRenderScene scene: SCNScene, atTime time: TimeInterval)
```

## Parameters

- `renderer`: The SceneKit object responsible for rendering the scene.
- `scene`: The scene object that was rendered.
- `time`: The current system time, in seconds. If your custom rendering involves animation, use this parameter to compute your own animation state.

## Discussion

Implement this method to perform custom drawing after SceneKit has rendered a scene—for example, to draw overlay content on top of SceneKit content. You should only execute Metal or OpenGL drawing commands (and any setup required to perform them) in this method—the results of modifying SceneKit objects in this method are undefined.

- To render using Metal, use the `renderer` parameter to retrieve the scene renderer’s [currentRenderCommandEncoder](../scnscenerenderer/currentrendercommandencoder.md) object and encode your own drawing commands. If you need to reference other Metal state, see the properties listed in [SCNSceneRenderer](../scnscenerenderer.md).
- To render using OpenGL, simply call the relevant OpenGL drawing commands—SceneKit automatically makes its OpenGL context the current context before calling this method. If you need to reference the OpenGL context being rendered into, examine the [context](../scnscenerenderer/context.md) property of the `renderer` parameter.

You must draw using the appropriate graphics technology for the view currently being rendered. Use the [renderingAPI](../scnscenerenderer/renderingapi.md) property of the `renderer` object to determine whether Metal or OpenGL is in use.
