# init(sources:elements:) (Swift)

**Framework:** SceneKit  
**Kind:** Initializer  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · iPadOS 8.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ (deprecated in 26.0) · macOS 10.8+ (deprecated in 26.0) · tvOS 9.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · visionOS 1.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · watchOS 3.0+ (deprecated in 26.0)

Creates a new geometry built from the specified geometry sources and elements.

## Declaration

```swift
convenience init(sources: [SCNGeometrySource], elements: [SCNGeometryElement]?)
```

## Parameters

- `sources`: An array of [SCNGeometrySource](../scngeometrysource.md) objects describing vertices in the geometry and their attributes.
- `elements`: An array of [SCNGeometryElement](../scngeometryelement.md) objects describing how to connect the geometry’s vertices.

## Discussion

A geometry’s visible content comes from the combination of geometry sources, which contain data describing its vertices, with geometry elements, which contain data describing how the vertices connect to form a surface.

Each [SCNGeometrySource](../scngeometrysource.md) object describes an attribute of all vertices in the geometry (vertex position, surface normal vector, color, or texture mapping coordinates) identified by the source’s [semantic](../scngeometrysource/semantic-swift.property.md) property. To create a custom geometry you must provide at least one source, for the [vertex](../scngeometrysource/semantic-swift.struct/vertex.md) semantic. Typically, you also provide sources for normals and texture coordinates for use in lighting and shading.

Sources for the vertex, normal, and color semantics must be unique—if multiple objects in the `sources` array have the same semantic, SceneKit uses only the first. A geometry may have multiple sources for the [texcoord](../scngeometrysource/semantic-swift.struct/texcoord.md) semantic—the order of texture coordinate sources in the `sources` array determines the value to use for the [mappingChannel](../scnmaterialproperty/mappingchannel.md) property when attaching materials.

Each [SCNGeometryElement](../scngeometryelement.md) object describes how vertices from the geometry sources are combined into polygons to create the geometry’s shape. Creating a custom geometry requires at least one element. If the `elements` array contains multiple objects, their order determines the arrangement of the geometry’s materials—for details, see the discussion of the [materials](materials.md) property.
