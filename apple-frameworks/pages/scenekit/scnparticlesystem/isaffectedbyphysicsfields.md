# isAffectedByPhysicsFields (Swift)

**Framework:** SceneKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · iPadOS 8.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ (deprecated in 26.0) · macOS 10.8+ (deprecated in 26.0) · tvOS 9.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · visionOS 1.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · watchOS 3.0+ (deprecated in 26.0)

A Boolean value that determines whether physics fields in the scene affect the motion of particles.

## Declaration

```swift
var isAffectedByPhysicsFields: Bool { get set }
```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

[SCNPhysicsField](../scnphysicsfield.md) objects attached to nodes in the scene apply forces to bodies in their area of effect. For example, a radial gravity field attracts bodies toward its center, and a vortex field applies forces that circulate around a specified axis. The forces applied by a physics field on each particle are proportional to its mass, as specified by the [particleMass](particlemass.md) property.

The default value is [false](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false), specifying that physics fields in the scene do not affect particles.
