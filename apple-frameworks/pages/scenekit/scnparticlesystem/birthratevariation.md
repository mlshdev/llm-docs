# birthRateVariation (Swift)

**Framework:** SceneKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · iPadOS 8.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ (deprecated in 26.0) · macOS 10.8+ (deprecated in 26.0) · tvOS 9.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · visionOS 1.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · watchOS 3.0+ (deprecated in 26.0)

The range of randomized particle birth rate values. Animatable.

## Declaration

```swift
var birthRateVariation: CGFloat { get set }
```

## Discussion

Setting a nonzero value for this property randomizes the effect of the [birthRate](birthrate.md) property. For each emission period, SceneKit randomly adjusts the birth rate by up to half the [birthRateVariation](birthratevariation.md) value. For example, if the [birthRate](birthrate.md) value is `100` particles and the [birthRateVariation](birthratevariation.md) value is `50` particles, the system randomly emits between 75 and 125 particles during its [emissionDuration](emissionduration.md) period.

The default value is `0.0` seconds, specifying no randomization.

You can animate changes to this property’s value. See [Animating SceneKit Content](../animating-scenekit-content.md).
