# particleFriction (Swift)

**Framework:** SceneKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · iPadOS 8.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ (deprecated in 26.0) · macOS 10.8+ (deprecated in 26.0) · tvOS 9.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · visionOS 1.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · watchOS 3.0+ (deprecated in 26.0)

The friction coefficient of each particle in the system. Animatable.

## Declaration

```swift
var particleFriction: CGFloat { get set }
```

## Discussion

Friction determines a particle’s resistance to sliding motion after a collision. (To define collision behavior, see the [colliderNodes](collidernodes.md) property.) You can randomize the friction coefficients of particles in the system with the [particleFrictionVariation](particlefrictionvariation.md) property.

A value of `1.0` (the default) allows a particle to slide freely, and a value of `0.0` prevents a particle from sliding.

You can animate changes to this property’s value. See [Animating SceneKit Content](../animating-scenekit-content.md).
