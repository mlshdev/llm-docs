# particleMass (Swift)

**Framework:** SceneKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · iPadOS 8.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ (deprecated in 26.0) · macOS 10.8+ (deprecated in 26.0) · tvOS 9.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · visionOS 1.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · watchOS 3.0+ (deprecated in 26.0)

The mass, in kilograms, of each particle in the system. Animatable.

## Declaration

```swift
var particleMass: CGFloat { get set }
```

## Discussion

A particle’s mass determines its resistance to forces. The effects of the [dampingFactor](dampingfactor.md) property and any [SCNPhysicsField](../scnphysicsfield.md) objects affecting each particle are proportional to its mass. You can randomize the masses of particles in the system with the [particleMassVariation](particlemassvariation.md) property.

The default value is `1.0` kilograms.

You can animate changes to this property’s value. See [Animating SceneKit Content](../animating-scenekit-content.md).
