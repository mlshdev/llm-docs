# particleBounce (Swift)

**Framework:** SceneKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · iPadOS 8.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ (deprecated in 26.0) · macOS 10.8+ (deprecated in 26.0) · tvOS 9.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · visionOS 1.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · watchOS 3.0+ (deprecated in 26.0)

The restitution coefficient of each particle in the system. Animatable.

## Declaration

```swift
var particleBounce: CGFloat { get set }
```

## Discussion

Restitution determines the amount of energy gained or lost in a collision. (To define collision behavior, see the [colliderNodes](collidernodes.md) property.)

A value of `1.0` specifies that a particle loses no energy in a collision (for example, a particle that falls from a certain height onto a flat surface bounces back to the same height). Larger values specify energy gained, and smaller values specify a loss of energy. A value of `0.0` prevents particles from bouncing. You can randomize the bounce factors of particles in the system with the [particleBounceVariation](particlebouncevariation.md) property.

The default value is `0.7`.

You can animate changes to this property’s value. See [Animating SceneKit Content](../animating-scenekit-content.md).
