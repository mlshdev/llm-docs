# kinematic() (Swift)

**Framework:** SceneKit  
**Kind:** Type Method  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · iPadOS 8.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ (deprecated in 26.0) · macOS 10.8+ (deprecated in 26.0) · tvOS 9.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · visionOS 1.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · watchOS 3.0+ (deprecated in 26.0)

Creates a physics body that is unaffected by forces or collisions but that can cause collisions affecting other bodies when moved.

## Declaration

```swift
class func kinematic() -> Self
```

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

A new physics body object.

## Discussion

Use kinematic bodies for scene elements that you want to control directly but whose movement manipulates other elements. For example, to allow the user to push objects around with a finger, you might create a kinematic body and attach it to an invisible node that you move follow touch events. (In macOS, use the same technique to allow the user to move objects with the mouse pointer.)

For the body to participate in collision detection or respond to forces, you must attach it to the [physicsBody](../scnnode/physicsbody.md) property of an [SCNNode](../scnnode.md) object in a scene.

SceneKit automatically creates a physics shape for the body when you attach it to a node, based on that node’s [geometry](../scnnode/geometry.md) property. To create a physics shape that’s based on the geometries of a node and its hierarchy of children, or to control the level of detail in a physics shape, create the physics shape manually using an [SCNPhysicsShape](../scnphysicsshape.md) class method.

> **Note**

>  For nodes containing custom geometry, the physics shape SceneKit automatically creates is a rough approximation of the geometry. This approximation, or *convex hull*, provides a compromise between accuracy and performance in collision detection. For the best collision detection performance, create an [SCNPhysicsShape](../scnphysicsshape.md) instance based on a basic geometry class ([SCNBox](../scnbox.md), [SCNSphere](../scnsphere.md), [SCNPyramid](../scnpyramid.md), [SCNCone](../scncone.md), [SCNCylinder](../scncylinder.md), or [SCNCapsule](../scncapsule.md)).
