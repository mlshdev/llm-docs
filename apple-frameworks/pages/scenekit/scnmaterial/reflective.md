# reflective (Swift)

**Framework:** SceneKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · iPadOS 8.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ (deprecated in 26.0) · macOS 10.8+ (deprecated in 26.0) · tvOS 9.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · visionOS 1.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · watchOS 3.0+ (deprecated in 26.0)

An object that defines the reflected color for each point on a surface.

## Discussion

You can simulate a mirrored or chromed finish on a surface by causing it to reflect its environment. SceneKit does not render real-time reflections of the objects in a scene, but it can use an *environment map* texture to simulate reflection of a static or animated image. When rendering each pixel on the surface, SceneKit traces the light from that point to a pixel in the environment map as if the surface was reflecting that image.

By default, the reflective property’s [contents](../scnmaterialproperty/contents.md) object is a white color, causing the property to have no visible effect. Setting the reflective property’s contents to any solid color adds uniform shading to the material. To create a reflective effect, set the property’s contents to an image or other texture-mapped content.

To produce a mirror-finish effect using an environment map, the texture image should take one of two forms:

- A sphere map, a square image whose content depicts an environment as reflected by a mirrored sphere.
- A cube map, an array of six square images which together form an imaginary cube enclosing the scene, whose inner surfaces are reflected by the material. You create a cube map by setting the reflective property’s [contents](../scnmaterialproperty/contents.md) object to an [NSArray](../../foundation/nsarray.md) instance containing six images, each corresponding to a direction in the scene’s world coordinate space in the following order: +X, -X, +Y, -Y, +Z, -Z (or Right, Left, Top, Bottom, Near, Far).

The figure below shows a material (with a texture for its [normal](normal.md) property) before and after providing a cube map for the reflective property.

This material property does not apply to physically-based materials (see [physicallyBased](lightingmodel-swift.struct/physicallybased.md)). Instead, such materials reflect environment-based lighting (see the [SCNScene](../scnscene.md) [lightingEnvironment](../scnscene/lightingenvironment.md) property) based on their [metalness](metalness.md) and [roughness](roughness.md) properties.
