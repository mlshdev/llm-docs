# ambient (Swift)

**Framework:** SceneKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · iPadOS 8.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ (deprecated in 26.0) · macOS 10.8+ (deprecated in 26.0) · tvOS 9.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · visionOS 1.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · watchOS 3.0+ (deprecated in 26.0)

An object that manages the material’s response to ambient lighting.

## Declaration

```swift
var ambient: SCNMaterialProperty { get }
```

## Discussion

Ambient shading describes the amount and color of ambient light reflected by the material. Ambient shading is uniform in all directions at all points on a surface. If a scene does not contain lights whose type is [ambient](../scnlight/lighttype/ambient.md), this property has no effect on a material’s appearance.

By default, the ambient property’s [contents](../scnmaterialproperty/contents.md) object is a dark gray color. Changing the ambient property’s contents lets you specify a different color or texture for the areas of a surface not directly illuminated by lights in a scene. To make the material respond identically to both ambient and diffuse light, set its [locksAmbientWithDiffuse](locksambientwithdiffuse.md) property to [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true).

The figure below shows a material (with a texture for its [diffuse](diffuse.md) property) before and after setting the ambient property’s contents to a solid color.

The material’s [lightingModel](lightingmodel-swift.property.md) property determines the formula SceneKit uses to combine its ambient color and other visual properties with lights and other contents in a scene to produce the final color for each rendered pixel in the rendered scene. For details, see `Lighting Models`.

This material property does not apply to physically-based materials (see [physicallyBased](lightingmodel-swift.struct/physicallybased.md)).

The material’s [lightingModelName](lightingmodel-swift.property.md) property determines the formula SceneKit uses to combine its ambient color and other visual properties with lights and other contents in a scene to produce the final color for each rendered pixel in the rendered scene. For details, see `Lighting Models`.
