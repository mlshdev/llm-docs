# specular (Swift)

**Framework:** SceneKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · iPadOS 8.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ (deprecated in 26.0) · macOS 10.8+ (deprecated in 26.0) · tvOS 9.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · visionOS 1.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · watchOS 3.0+ (deprecated in 26.0)

An object that manages the material’s specular response to lighting.

## Declaration

```swift
var specular: SCNMaterialProperty { get }
```

## Discussion

Specular shading describes the amount and color of light reflected by the material directly toward the viewer, forming a bright highlight on the surface and simulating a glossy or shiny appearance. You adjust the sharpness of specular highlights using the material’s [shininess](shininess.md) property.

By default, the specular property’s [contents](../scnmaterialproperty/contents.md) object is a black color, causing the material to appear dull or matte. Changing the specular property’s contents to a brighter color causes specular highlights to appear in that color, making the surface appear shiny. When you apply a texture to the specular property, the texture image becomes a *specular map*—the brightness of each pixel in the image determines the tendency of each point on the material’s surface to create specular highlights when lit.

The figure below shows a material (with a texture for its [diffuse](diffuse.md) property) before and after providing a specular map image. Notice that the bright specular highlights appear only on portions of the surface where the specular map image is white.

The material’s [lightingModel](lightingmodel-swift.property.md) property determines the formula SceneKit uses to combine its specularity and other visual properties with lights and other contents in a scene to produce the final color for each rendered pixel in the rendered scene. For details, see `Lighting Models`.

This material property does not apply to physically-based materials (see [physicallyBased](lightingmodel-swift.struct/physicallybased.md)).
