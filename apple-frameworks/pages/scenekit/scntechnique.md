## Declaration

```swift
class SCNTechnique
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Examples of multipass rendering techniques include:

- Postprocessing rendered pixels. To create effects such as color grading and displacement mapping, define techniques that use as input the color buffer rendered by SceneKit and process that buffer with a fragment shader.
- Deferred shading. To create effects such as motion blur and screen-space ambient occlusion (SSAO), define techniques that capture information about the scene into an intermediary buffer during the main rendering pass and then perform additional drawing passes using that buffer to create the final output image. The figure below illustrates the rendering process for an SSAO technique.

![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.scenekit/media-2929792@2x.png)

To create an [SCNTechnique](scntechnique.md) object, you supply a technique definition that specifies the input and output image buffers, shader programs, shader input variables, and rendering options for each drawing pass in the technique. Defining a technique does not require Metal or OpenGL client code, but you should be familiar with the terminology and conventions of GPU rendering.

To use a technique, assign it to the [technique](scntechniquesupport/technique.md) property of a view (or other SceneKit renderer object) or a camera.

### Defining a Technique

SceneKit treats rendering techniques—along with shaders, 3D models, and 2D art assets—as resources rather than as part of your application code. Because the effects you create with techniques are highly visual, this approach allows you to separate design efforts from development efforts and quickly iterate on creating the visual content of your app or game.

Create a technique object using the [init(dictionary:)](scntechnique/init%28dictionary_%29.md) method, providing a dictionary that defines the technique as a series of drawing passes, each with its own shader program, inputs and outputs, and rendering options. Typically, you obtain this dictionary from a property list file included in your app’s bundle resources. Table 1 and the additional tables and sections that follow specify the format of this dictionary’s contents.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `passes` | A dictionary of drawing pass definitions. ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.scenekit/spacer.png) Each key is a unique string you provide to identify the pass, and the corresponding value is a dictionary defining that drawing pass. See Table 2. |
| `sequence` | An array of strings, each of which names a drawing pass from the `passes` dictionary. SceneKit performs the drawing passes in the order specified by this array. |
| `symbols` | A dictionary defining the bindings for GLSL attributes and uniform variables used in the technique’s shader programs. ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.scenekit/spacer.png) Each key matches the name of a symbol used in the shader source code, and the corresponding value is a dictionary describing how that symbol should be used. See Table 4. |
| `targets` (optional) | A dictionary defining intermediary rendering targets. ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.scenekit/spacer.png) Each key is a unique string you provide to identify the target (used in the inputs and outputs dictionaries of a drawing pass definition), and the corresponding value is a dictionary defining the rendering target. See Table 5. |

| Key | Type | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `draw` | String | What to render for the drawing pass: ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.scenekit/spacer.png) `DRAW_SCENE`: Render the entire scene. ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.scenekit/spacer.png) `DRAW_NODE`: Render only the node specified by the `node` key (and its hierarchy of child nodes). ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.scenekit/spacer.png) `DRAW_QUAD`: Render only a rectangle covering the entire bounds of the view. Use this option for drawing passes that process image buffers output by earlier passes. |
| `program` | String | The GLSL shader program to use for the drawing pass. ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.scenekit/spacer.png) Shader source code files in the app’s bundle resources directory must have the same base name and the extensions `.vsh` (vertex shader) and `.fsh` (fragment shader). For example, if the program name is “invert”, the files “invert.fsh” and “invert.vsh” must exist. |

<a id="Category-Masks"></a>

#### Category Masks

When SceneKit performs a rendering pass whose `draw` option is `DRAW_SCENE` or `DRAW_NODE`, you can use category masks to filter the set of nodes drawn during that pass. For each node in the scene (or for `DRAW_NODE`, in the node subtree), SceneKit compares the node’s [categoryBitMask](scnnode/categorybitmask.md) property and the `includeCategoryMask` and `excludeCategoryMask` options in the pass definition using bitwise AND operations. If the node’s category mask and the include mask overlap (that is, the bitwise AND results in a nonzero value) and the node’s category mask and the exclude mask do not overlap, SceneKit includes the node in the drawing pass. Otherwise the node is not rendered in the pass.

<a id="Render-Targets-Inputs-and-Outputs"></a>

#### Render Targets, Inputs and Outputs

A drawing pass renders pixel data into one or more target image buffer (or framebuffer). In SceneKit’s main drawing pass, the color render target is the screen (or rather, a view or layer for screen display), and a depth render target temporarily stores the information needed to ensure that rendered surfaces appear in the correct depth order.

A pass in a custom rendering technique may postprocess the pixel data in SceneKit’s render target, generate its own pixel data for display, or render to an intermediate target to be used as input in a later pass. You specify render targets using the following identifiers in the `inputs` and `outputs` dictionaries of a pass definition:

- Use the `COLOR` and `DEPTH` targets as inputs to identify the color and depth buffers rendered to in SceneKit’s main drawing pass.

Use the `COLOR` target as an output to identify the image buffer displayed as the end result of a technique.

- To create an intermediate target, define your own identifier as a key in the `targets` dictionary of a technique definition. For the corresponding value, provide a dictionary defining the render target using the keys and values in Table 5. Intermediate targets may be color, depth, or combined depth and stencil buffers. After you define a target, you can use its identifier in the `inputs` and `outputs` dictionaries of a pass definition.
- To use an image as an input texture for a pass, define a symbol of type `sampler2D` in the technique’s `symbols` dictionary.

To specify a render target or image sampler in the `inputs` dictionary of a pass definition, you can provide either an identifier string or a dictionary with the format described in Table 6. The options for samplers correspond to similar properties for SceneKit material textures. For more details on each, see [SCNMaterialProperty](scnmaterialproperty.md).

| Key | Type | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | String | The type of render target: `color`, `depth`, or `stencil`. |
| `format` (optional) | String | The render target’s pixel format; one of the following: ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.scenekit/spacer.png) Color: `rgba` (default), `rgb32f`, `r8`, or `r16` ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.scenekit/spacer.png) Depth/stencil: `depth24` (default) or `depth24stencil8` |
| `size` | String | The size of the render target image, in points, specified in a string of format “WxH”. For example, the string “320x480” specifies an image buffer 320 points wide by 480 points tall. |
| `scaleFactor` (optional) | Number (floating-point) | The scale factor of the render target. Defaults to `1.0`. For example, a value of `2.0` specifies 2 pixels per point, so a target whose size is “320x480” is 640 by 960 pixels. |

| Key | Type | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `target` | String | `COLOR`, `DEPTH`, a key from the technique’s `targets` dictionary, or a key from the technique’s `symbols` dictionary identifying a texture sampler. |
| `magnificationFilter` (optional) ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.scenekit/spacer.png) `minificationFilter` (optional) | String | `linear` or `nearest`. |
| `mipFilter` (optional) | String | `linear`, `nearest`, or `none`. |
| `wrapS` (optional) ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.scenekit/spacer.png) `wrapT` (optional) ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.scenekit/spacer.png) `wrapP` (optional) | String | `clamp`, `repeat`, `clampToBorder`, `mirror`. |

<a id="Blending"></a>

#### Blending

The `blendStates` key of a pass definition defines color blending options. Blending is disabled by default for faster rendering performance. Including a dictionary for this key enables blending (unless the dictionary’s `enable` key specifies [false](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false)). Color blending combines a source color (the color output by the drawing pass’s shader program) with a destination color (the existing contents of the output buffer) using specified modes and operations.

- Available blend modes (for the `colorSrc`, `colorDst`, `alphaSrc`, and `alphaDst` keys): `zero`, `one`, `srcColor`, `oneMinusSrcColor`, `srcAlpha`, `oneMinusSrcAlpha`, `dstColor`, `oneMinusDstColor`, `dstAlpha`, `oneMinusDstAlpha`, `constantColor`, `oneMinusConstantColor`, `constantAlpha`, `oneMinusConstantAlpha`, and `alphaSaturate`.
- Available blend operations (for the `colorOp` and `alphaOp` keys): `add`, `subtract`, `reverseSubtract`, `min`, `max`.

These values correspond to blending options defined by the OpenGL specification. For further details, consult the [OpenGL API Registry](http://www.opengl.org/registry/) or [OpenGL ES API Registry](http://www.khronos.org/registry/gles/).

### Example Technique Definition

Listing 1 shows an example definition dictionary for a technique that uses displacement mapping with a noise texture to postprocess a rendered scene. For ease of reading, the dictionary is formatted in JSON syntax. (To load an [NSDictionary](../foundation/nsdictionary.md) object from text in this format, use the [JSONSerialization](../foundation/jsonserialization.md) class.) Listing 2 and Listing 3 show the GLSL source code for the technique’s vertex and fragment shaders.

## Overview

Examples of multipass rendering techniques include:

- Postprocessing rendered pixels. To create effects such as color grading and displacement mapping, define techniques that use as input the color buffer rendered by SceneKit and process that buffer with a fragment shader.
- Deferred shading. To create effects such as motion blur and screen-space ambient occlusion (SSAO), define techniques that capture information about the scene into an intermediary buffer during the main rendering pass and then perform additional drawing passes using that buffer to create the final output image. The figure below illustrates the rendering process for an SSAO technique.

![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.scenekit/media-2929792@2x.png)

To create an [SCNTechnique](scntechnique.md) object, you supply a technique definition that specifies the input and output image buffers, shader programs, shader input variables, and rendering options for each drawing pass in the technique. Defining a technique does not require Metal or OpenGL client code, but you should be familiar with the terminology and conventions of GPU rendering.

To use a technique, assign it to the [technique](scntechniquesupport/technique.md) property of a view (or other SceneKit renderer object) or a camera.

<a id="Defining-a-Technique"></a>

### Defining a Technique

SceneKit treats rendering techniques—along with shaders, 3D models, and 2D art assets—as resources rather than as part of your application code. Because the effects you create with techniques are highly visual, this approach allows you to separate design efforts from development efforts and quickly iterate on creating the visual content of your app or game.

Create a technique object using the [techniqueWithDictionary:](scntechnique/init%28dictionary_%29.md) method, providing a dictionary that defines the technique as a series of drawing passes, each with its own shader program, inputs and outputs, and rendering options. Typically, you obtain this dictionary from a property list file included in your app’s bundle resources. Table 1 and the additional tables and sections that follow specify the format of this dictionary’s contents.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `passes` | A dictionary of drawing pass definitions. ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.scenekit/spacer.png) Each key is a unique string you provide to identify the pass, and the corresponding value is a dictionary defining that drawing pass. See Table 2. |
| `sequence` | An array of strings, each of which names a drawing pass from the `passes` dictionary. SceneKit performs the drawing passes in the order specified by this array. |
| `symbols` | A dictionary defining the bindings for GLSL attributes and uniform variables used in the technique’s shader programs. ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.scenekit/spacer.png) Each key matches the name of a symbol used in the shader source code, and the corresponding value is a dictionary describing how that symbol should be used. See Table 4. |
| `targets` (optional) | A dictionary defining intermediary rendering targets. ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.scenekit/spacer.png) Each key is a unique string you provide to identify the target (used in the inputs and outputs dictionaries of a drawing pass definition), and the corresponding value is a dictionary defining the rendering target. See Table 5. |

| Key | Type | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |

#### Category Masks

When SceneKit performs a rendering pass whose `draw` option is `DRAW_SCENE` or `DRAW_NODE`, you can use category masks to filter the set of nodes drawn during that pass. For each node in the scene (or for `DRAW_NODE`, in the node subtree), SceneKit compares the node’s [categoryBitMask](scnnode/categorybitmask.md) property and the `includeCategoryMask` and `excludeCategoryMask` options in the pass definition using bitwise AND operations. If the node’s category mask and the include mask overlap (that is, the bitwise AND results in a nonzero value) and the node’s category mask and the exclude mask do not overlap, SceneKit includes the node in the drawing pass. Otherwise the node is not rendered in the pass.

<a id="Render-Targets-Inputs-and-Outputs"></a>

#### Render Targets, Inputs and Outputs

A drawing pass renders pixel data into one or more target image buffer (or framebuffer). In SceneKit’s main drawing pass, the color render target is the screen (or rather, a view or layer for screen display), and a depth render target temporarily stores the information needed to ensure that rendered surfaces appear in the correct depth order.

A pass in a custom rendering technique may postprocess the pixel data in SceneKit’s render target, generate its own pixel data for display, or render to an intermediate target to be used as input in a later pass. You specify render targets using the following identifiers in the `inputs` and `outputs` dictionaries of a pass definition:

- Use the `COLOR` and `DEPTH` targets as inputs to identify the color and depth buffers rendered to in SceneKit’s main drawing pass.

Use the `COLOR` target as an output to identify the image buffer displayed as the end result of a technique.

- To create an intermediate target, define your own identifier as a key in the `targets` dictionary of a technique definition. For the corresponding value, provide a dictionary defining the render target using the keys and values in Table 5. Intermediate targets may be color, depth, or combined depth and stencil buffers. After you define a target, you can use its identifier in the `inputs` and `outputs` dictionaries of a pass definition.
- To use an image as an input texture for a pass, define a symbol of type `sampler2D` in the technique’s `symbols` dictionary.

To specify a render target or image sampler in the `inputs` dictionary of a pass definition, you can provide either an identifier string or a dictionary with the format described in Table 6. The options for samplers correspond to similar properties for SceneKit material textures. For more details on each, see [SCNMaterialProperty](scnmaterialproperty.md).

| Key | Type | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | String | The type of render target: `color`, `depth`, or `stencil`. |
| `format` (optional) | String | The render target’s pixel format; one of the following: ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.scenekit/spacer.png) Color: `rgba` (default), `rgb32f`, `r8`, or `r16` ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.scenekit/spacer.png) Depth/stencil: `depth24` (default) or `depth24stencil8` |
| `size` | String | The size of the render target image, in points, specified in a string of format “WxH”. For example, the string “320x480” specifies an image buffer 320 points wide by 480 points tall. |
| `scaleFactor` (optional) | Number (floating-point) | The scale factor of the render target. Defaults to `1.0`. For example, a value of `2.0` specifies 2 pixels per point, so a target whose size is “320x480” is 640 by 960 pixels. |

| Key | Type | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `target` | String | `COLOR`, `DEPTH`, a key from the technique’s `targets` dictionary, or a key from the technique’s `symbols` dictionary identifying a texture sampler. |

| `mipFilter` (optional) | String | `linear`, `nearest`, or `none`. |
| `wrapS` (optional) ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.scenekit/spacer.png) `wrapT` (optional) ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.scenekit/spacer.png) `wrapP` (optional) | String | `clamp`, `repeat`, `clampToBorder`, `mirror`. |

#### Blending

The `blendStates` key of a pass definition defines color blending options. Blending is disabled by default for faster rendering performance. Including a dictionary for this key enables blending (unless the dictionary’s `enable` key specifies [false](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false)). Color blending combines a source color (the color output by the drawing pass’s shader program) with a destination color (the existing contents of the output buffer) using specified modes and operations.

- Available blend modes (for the `colorSrc`, `colorDst`, `alphaSrc`, and `alphaDst` keys): `zero`, `one`, `srcColor`, `oneMinusSrcColor`, `srcAlpha`, `oneMinusSrcAlpha`, `dstColor`, `oneMinusDstColor`, `dstAlpha`, `oneMinusDstAlpha`, `constantColor`, `oneMinusConstantColor`, `constantAlpha`, `oneMinusConstantAlpha`, and `alphaSaturate`.
- Available blend operations (for the `colorOp` and `alphaOp` keys): `add`, `subtract`, `reverseSubtract`, `min`, `max`.

These values correspond to blending options defined by the OpenGL specification. For further details, consult the [OpenGL API Registry](http://www.opengl.org/registry/) or [OpenGL ES API Registry](http://www.khronos.org/registry/gles/).
