# Objective-C Root Class

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** Objective-C Runtime  
**Kind:** API Collection

This macro annotates a class as being an Objective-C root class.

## Topics

### Constants

- [OBJC_ROOT_CLASS](objc_root_class.md): If you define an Objective-C root class, you receive a compiler error indicating that the class is defined without specifying a base class. You can avoid this compiler error by preceding the definition of the root class (that is, before the `@interface` directive) with `OBJC_ROOT_CLASS`.

- [Boolean Values](boolean-values.md): These macros define convenient constants to represent Boolean values.
- [Null Values](null-values.md): These macros define null values for classes and instances.
- [Dispatch Function Prototypes](dispatch-function-prototypes.md): This macro indicates whether dispatch functions must be cast to an appropriate function pointer type.
- [Local Variable Storage Duration](local-variable-storage-duration.md): This macro indicates that the values stored in certain local variables should not be aggressively released by the compiler during optimization.
