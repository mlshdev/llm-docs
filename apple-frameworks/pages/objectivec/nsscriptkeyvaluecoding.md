# NSScriptKeyValueCoding (Swift)

**Framework:** Objective-C Runtime  
**Kind:** API Collection

A collection of methods that provide additional capabilities for working with key-value coding.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Cocoa scripting takes advantage of key-value coding to get and set information in scriptable objects. The methods in this category provide additional capabilities for working with key-value coding, including getting and setting key values by index in multi-value keys and coercing (or converting) a key value. Additional methods allow the implementer of a scriptable container class to provide fast access to elements that are being referenced by name and unique ID.

Because Cocoa scripting invokes [setValue(\_:forKey:)](nsobject-swift.class/setvalue%28__forkey_%29.md) and [mutableArrayValue(forKey:)](nsobject-swift.class/mutablearrayvalue%28forkey_%29.md), changes to model objects made by AppleScript scripts are observable using automatic key-value observing.

> **Note**

>  In OS X 10.3 and earlier, Cocoa scripting did not invoke [setValue(\_:forKey:)](nsobject-swift.class/setvalue%28__forkey_%29.md) or [mutableArrayValue(forKey:)](nsobject-swift.class/mutablearrayvalue%28forkey_%29.md), so automatic key-value observing notification was not always done for model object changes caused by scripts. Starting in macOS 10.4, for backward binary compatibility, if it is overridden, Cocoa invokes the now-deprecated method [takeValue(\_:forKey:)](nsobject-swift.class/takevalue%28__forkey_%29.md) instead of [setValue(\_:forKey:)](nsobject-swift.class/setvalue%28__forkey_%29.md).

## Topics

### Indexed access

- [insertValue(\_:at:inPropertyWithKey:)](nsobject-swift.class/insertvalue%28__at_inpropertywithkey_%29.md): Inserts an object at the specified index in the collection specified by the passed key.
- [removeValue(at:fromPropertyWithKey:)](nsobject-swift.class/removevalue%28at_frompropertywithkey_%29.md): Removes the object at the specified index from the collection specified by the passed key.
- [replaceValue(at:inPropertyWithKey:withValue:)](nsobject-swift.class/replacevalue%28at_inpropertywithkey_withvalue_%29.md): Replaces the object at the specified index in the collection specified by the passed key.
- [value(at:inPropertyWithKey:)](nsobject-swift.class/value%28at_inpropertywithkey_%29.md): Retrieves an indexed object from the collection specified by the passed key.

### Access by name, key, or ID

- [insertValue(\_:inPropertyWithKey:)](nsobject-swift.class/insertvalue%28__inpropertywithkey_%29.md): Inserts an object in the collection specified by the passed key.
- [value(withName:inPropertyWithKey:)](nsobject-swift.class/value%28withname_inpropertywithkey_%29.md): Retrieves a named object from the collection specified by the passed key.
- [value(withUniqueID:inPropertyWithKey:)](nsobject-swift.class/value%28withuniqueid_inpropertywithkey_%29.md): Retrieves an object by ID from the collection specified by the passed key.

### Coercion

- [coerceValue(\_:forKey:)](nsobject-swift.class/coercevalue%28__forkey_%29.md): Uses type info from the class description and `NSScriptCoercionHandler` to attempt to convert `value` for `key` to the proper type, if necessary.

### Constants

- [NSScriptKeyValueCoding Exception Names](nsscriptkeyvaluecoding-exception-names.md): Exceptions raised by key-value coding methods.

Additional methods allow the implementer of a scriptable container class to provide fast access to elements that are being referenced by name and unique ID.

Because Cocoa scripting invokes [setValue:forKey:](nsobject-swift.class/setvalue%28__forkey_%29.md) and [mutableArrayValueForKey:](nsobject-swift.class/mutablearrayvalue%28forkey_%29.md), changes to model objects made by AppleScript scripts are observable using automatic key-value observing.

> **Note**

>  In OS X 10.3 and earlier, Cocoa scripting did not invoke [setValue:forKey:](nsobject-swift.class/setvalue%28__forkey_%29.md) or [mutableArrayValueForKey:](nsobject-swift.class/mutablearrayvalue%28forkey_%29.md), so automatic key-value observing notification was not always done for model object changes caused by scripts.

- [replaceValueAtIndex:inPropertyWithKey:withValue:](nsobject-swift.class/replacevalue%28at_inpropertywithkey_withvalue_%29.md): Replaces the object at the specified index in the collection specified by the passed key.
- [valueAtIndex:inPropertyWithKey:](nsobject-swift.class/value%28at_inpropertywithkey_%29.md): Retrieves an indexed object from the collection specified by the passed key.

### Access by name, key, or ID
