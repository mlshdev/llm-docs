### Fields

- [mask](1808499-mask.md): An integer specifying the total number of allocated cache buckets (minus one). During method lookup, the Objective-C runtime uses this field to determine the index at which to begin a linear search of the `buckets` array. A pointer to a method’s selector is masked against this field using a logical AND operation (`index = (mask & selector))`. This serves as a simple hashing algorithm.
- [buckets](1808503-buckets.md): An array of pointers to [Method](method.md) data structures. This array may contain no more than `mask + 1` items. Note that pointers may be `NULL`, indicating that the cache bucket is unoccupied, and occupied buckets may not be contiguous. This array may grow over time.
