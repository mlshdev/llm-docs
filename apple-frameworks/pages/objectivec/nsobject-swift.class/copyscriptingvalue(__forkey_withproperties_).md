# copyScriptingValue(\_:forKey:withProperties:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Objective-C Runtime  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** macOS 10.5+

Creates and returns one or more scripting objects to be inserted into the specified relationship by copying the passed-in value and setting the properties in the copied object or objects.

## Declaration

```swift
func copyScriptingValue(_ value: Any, forKey key: String, withProperties properties: [String : Any]) -> Any?
```

## Parameters

- `value`: An object or objects to be copied. The type must match the type of the property identified by `key`. (See also the Discussion section.)

  For example, if the property is a to-many relationship, `value` will always be an array of objects to be copied, and this method must therefore return an array of objects.
- `key`: A key that identifies the relationship into which to insert the copied object or objects.
- `properties`: The properties to be set in the copied object or objects.  Derived from the “with properties” parameter of a `duplicate` command. (See also the Discussion section.)

## Return Value

The copied object or objects. Returns `nil` if an error occurs.

## Discussion

You can override the `copyScriptingValue` method to take more control when your application is sent a `duplicate` command. This method is invoked on the prospective container of the copied object or objects. The `properties` are derived from the `with properties` parameter of the `duplicate` command. The returned objects or objects are then inserted into the container using key-value coding.

When this method is invoked by Cocoa, neither the value nor the properties will have yet been coerced using the `NSScriptKeyValueCoding` method [coerceValue(\_:forKey:)](coercevalue%28__forkey_%29.md). For sdef-declared scriptability, however, the types of the passed-in objects reliably match the relevant sdef declarations.

The default implementation of this method copies scripting objects by sending `copyWithZone:` to the object or objects specified by `value`. You override this method for situations where this is not sufficient, such as in Core Data applications, in which new objects must be initialized with `[NSManagedObject initWithEntity:insertIntoManagedObjectContext:]`.

### Scripting

- [classCode](classcode.md): The receiver’s Apple event type code, as stored in the `NSScriptClassDescription` object for the object’s class.
- [className](classname.md): A string containing the name of the class.
- [newScriptingObject(of:forValueForKey:withContentsValue:properties:)](newscriptingobject%28of_forvalueforkey_withcontentsvalue_properties_%29.md): Creates and returns an instance of a scriptable class, setting its contents and properties, for insertion into the relationship identified by the key.
- [scriptingProperties](scriptingproperties.md): An `NSString`-keyed dictionary of the receiver’s scriptable properties.
- [scriptingValue(for:)](scriptingvalue%28for_%29.md): Given an object specifier, returns the specified object or objects in the receiving container.

## Declaration
