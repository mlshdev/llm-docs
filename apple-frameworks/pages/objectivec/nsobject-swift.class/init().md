# init() (Swift)

**Framework:** Objective-C Runtime  
**Kind:** Initializer  
**Availability:** iOS 2.0+ · iPadOS 2.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.0+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 1.0+

Implemented by subclasses to initialize a new object (the receiver) immediately after memory for it has been allocated.

## Declaration

```swift
init()
```

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

An initialized object, or `nil` if an object could not be created for some reason that would not result in an exception.

## Discussion

An [init()](init%28%29.md) message is coupled with an [alloc](alloc.md) (or [allocWithZone:](allocwithzone_.md)) message in the same line of code:

```objc
SomeClass *object = [[SomeClass alloc] init];
```

An object isn’t ready to be used until it has been initialized.

In a custom implementation of this method, you must invoke super’s [Initialization](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/DevPedia-CocoaCore/Initialization.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008195-CH21) then initialize and return the new object. If the new object can’t be initialized, the method should return `nil`. For example, a hypothetical `BuiltInCamera` class might return `nil` from its `init` method if run on a device that has no camera.

```objc
- (instancetype)init {
    if (self = [super init]) {
        // Initialize self
    }
    return self;
}
```

In some cases, a custom implementation of the [init()](init%28%29.md) method might return a substitute object. You must therefore always use the object returned by [init()](init%28%29.md), and not the one returned by [alloc](alloc.md) or [allocWithZone:](allocwithzone_.md), in subsequent code.

The [init()](init%28%29.md) method defined in the `NSObject` class does no initialization; it simply returns `self`. In terms of nullability, callers can assume that the `NSObject` implementation of [init()](init%28%29.md) does not return `nil`.

### Creating, Copying, and Deallocating Objects

- [copy()](copy%28%29.md): Returns the object returned by `copy(with:)`.
- [mutableCopy()](mutablecopy%28%29.md): Returns the object returned by `mutableCopy(with:)` where the zone is `nil`.
