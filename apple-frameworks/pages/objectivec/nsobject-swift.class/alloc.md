# alloc

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** Objective-C Runtime  
**Kind:** Type Method

Returns a new instance of the receiving class.

## Declaration

```objectivec
+ (instancetype) alloc;
```

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

A new instance of the receiver.

## Discussion

This is an instance variable of the new instance that is initialized to a data structure describing the class; memory for all other instance variables is set to `0`.

You must use an `init...` method to complete the initialization process. For example:

```objc
TheClass *newObject = [[TheClass alloc] init];
```

Do not override [alloc](alloc.md) to include initialization code. Instead, implement class-specific versions of `init...` methods.

For historical reasons, [alloc](alloc.md) invokes [allocWithZone:](allocwithzone_.md).

### Creating, Copying, and Deallocating Objects

- [allocWithZone:](allocwithzone_.md): Returns a new instance of the receiving class.
- [init](init%28%29.md): Implemented by subclasses to initialize a new object (the receiver) immediately after memory for it has been allocated.
- [copy](copy%28%29.md): Returns the object returned by `copy(with:)`.
- [copyWithZone:](copywithzone_.md): Returns the receiver.
- [mutableCopy](mutablecopy%28%29.md): Returns the object returned by `mutableCopy(with:)` where the zone is `nil`.
- [mutableCopyWithZone:](mutablecopywithzone_.md): Returns the receiver.
- [dealloc](dealloc.md): Deallocates the memory occupied by the receiver.
- [new](new.md): Allocates a new instance of the receiving class, sends it an [init](init%28%29.md) message, and returns the initialized object.
