# dealloc

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** Objective-C Runtime  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 2.0+ · iPadOS 2.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.0+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 1.0+

Deallocates the memory occupied by the receiver.

## Declaration

```objectivec
- (void) dealloc;
```

## Discussion

Subsequent messages to the receiver may generate an error indicating that a message was sent to a deallocated object (provided the deallocated memory hasn’t been reused yet).

You override this method to dispose of resources other than the object’s instance variables, for example:

```objc
- (void)dealloc {
    free(myBigBlockOfMemory);
}
```

In an implementation of `dealloc`, do not invoke the superclass’s implementation. You should try to avoid managing the lifetime of limited resources such as file descriptors using `dealloc`.

You never send a [dealloc](dealloc.md) message directly. Instead, an object’s `dealloc` method is invoked by the runtime. See [Advanced Memory Management Programming Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/MemoryMgmt/Articles/MemoryMgmt.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000011i) for more details.

### Special Considerations

When not using ARC, your implementation of `dealloc` must invoke the superclass’s implementation as its last instruction.

- [alloc](alloc.md): Returns a new instance of the receiving class.
- [allocWithZone:](allocwithzone_.md): Returns a new instance of the receiving class.
- [init](init%28%29.md): Implemented by subclasses to initialize a new object (the receiver) immediately after memory for it has been allocated.
- [copy](copy%28%29.md): Returns the object returned by `copy(with:)`.
- [copyWithZone:](copywithzone_.md): Returns the receiver.
- [mutableCopy](mutablecopy%28%29.md): Returns the object returned by `mutableCopy(with:)` where the zone is `nil`.
- [mutableCopyWithZone:](mutablecopywithzone_.md): Returns the receiver.
- [new](new.md): Allocates a new instance of the receiving class, sends it an [init](init%28%29.md) message, and returns the initialized object.
