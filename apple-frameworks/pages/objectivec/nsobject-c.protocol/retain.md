# retain

**Interface language:** Objective-C

Increments the receiver’s reference count.

## Declaration

## Return Value

`self`.

## Discussion

You send an object a [retain](retain.md) message when you want to prevent it from being deallocated until you have finished using it.

An object is deallocated automatically when its reference count reaches `0`. [retain](retain.md) messages increment the reference count, and [release](release.md) messages decrement it. For more information on this mechanism, see [Advanced Memory Management Programming Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/MemoryMgmt/Articles/MemoryMgmt.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000011i).

As a convenience, [retain](retain.md) returns `self` because it may be used in nested expressions.

You would implement this method only if you were defining your own reference-counting scheme. Such implementations must return `self` and should not invoke the inherited method by sending a [retain](retain.md) message to `super`.

### Special Considerations

Instead of using manual reference counting, you should adopt ARC—see [Transitioning to ARC Release Notes](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/releasenotes/ObjectiveC/RN-TransitioningToARC/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011226).

### Obsolete Methods

- [release](release.md): Decrements the receiver’s reference count.
- [autorelease](autorelease.md): Decrements the receiver’s retain count at the end of the current autorelease pool block.
- [retainCount](retaincount.md): Do not use this method.
- [zone](zone.md): Zones are deprecated and ignored by most classes that have it as a parameter.
