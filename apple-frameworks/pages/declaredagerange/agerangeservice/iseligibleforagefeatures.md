## Discussion

Before implementing age-gated features in your app, check whether the person using your app is in a region that requires Age Assurance. For more information, refer to [Next steps for apps distributed in Texas](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=2ezb6jhj). Use [isEligibleForAgeFeatures](iseligibleforagefeatures.md) to determine whether associated laws or regulations may apply to your app based on the person’s location and account settings. This property returns `true` when your app needs to support Age Assurance for the current user. In macOS, [isEligibleForAgeFeatures](iseligibleforagefeatures.md) returns `false` because the system doesn’t require Age Assurance for the person or device. However, you can still call `requestAgeRange` in macOS to get the declared age range.

> **Throws**

> [AgeRangeService.Error.notAvailable](error/notavailable.md) if it’s unavailable.
