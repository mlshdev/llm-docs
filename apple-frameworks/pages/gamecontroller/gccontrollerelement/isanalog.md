## Discussion

If this property is [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true), the input value defined by the element can return a range (from a minimum to maximum) of possible values. For example, this element might be a pressure-sensitive button or an axis of a thumbstick that allows for a range of physical movement. If this property is [false](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false), the input value is a discrete value, such as `0` if the element is off, and `1` if the element is on.
