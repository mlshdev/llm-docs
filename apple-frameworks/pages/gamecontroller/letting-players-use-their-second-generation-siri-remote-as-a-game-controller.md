# Letting players use their second-generation Siri Remote as a game controller (Swift)

**Framework:** Game Controller  
**Kind:** Article

Support the second-generation Siri Remote as a game controller in your Apple TV game.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

To add support for the second-generation Siri Remote in your Apple TV game, you make a few changes to your Xcode project and code.

<a id="Configure-your-project"></a>

### Configure your project

First configure your Xcode project to handle directional gamepads and multiple micro gamepads.

On the Signing & Capabilities tab in the project editor, add the Game Controllers capability to your project and check Directional Gamepad under Game Controllers. For more information, see [Configuring game controllers](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/configuring-game-controllers).

On the Info tab, add the [GCSupportsMultipleMicroGamepads](../bundleresources/information-property-list/gcsupportsmultiplemicrogamepads.md) key and set the value to `YES`. For more information, see [Managing your app’s information property list values](../bundleresources/managing-your-app-s-information-property-list.md).

### Handle multiple micro gamepads

In your code, handle multiple micro gamepad connections. When a game controller connects, check if the controller is a directional gamepad using the [isKind(of:)](../objectivec/nsobjectprotocol/iskind%28of_%29.md) method:

```swift
if controller.microGamepad isKind(of: GCDirectionalGamepad.class) {
   ...
}
```

Check if the device category is second-generation Siri Remote using the [productCategory](gcdevice/productcategory.md) property:

```swift
if device.productCategory == GCProductCategorySiriRemote2ndGen {
   ...
}
```

If these conditions are true, you can use the connected second-generation Siri Remote as a game controller.

### Access the remote buttons and directional pad

To access the center button of the second-generation Siri Remote, use the [buttons](gcdevicephysicalinputstate/buttons-3257g.md) property:

```swift
controller.physicalInputProfile.buttons[GCInputDirectionalCenterButton]
```

Then to access the directional pad, use the [dpads](gcdevicephysicalinputstate/dpads-5yr9x.md) property:

```swift
controller.physicalInputProfile.dpads[GCInputDirectionalCardinalDpad]
```

If your game requires an analog touch surface, check whether the directional pad is digital using the [isAnalog](gccontrollerelement/isanalog.md) property:

```swift
if physicalInputProfile.dpads[GCInputDirectionalDpad].isAnalog == false
```

For example, the Universal Electronic remote that works with Apple TV is a directional gamepad but with physical non-analog buttons.
