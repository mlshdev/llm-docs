## Overview

Apple News Format is the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format you use to create articles for Apple News.

An article created in Apple News Format can include text, images, audio, video, embedded social media, photo galleries, data tables, and interactive maps. You can enhance your article with animations, behaviors, and customized styles that let you create a unique look for your content. Your finished article is processed and rendered in Apple News.

With Apple News Format, you only have to author your content once. News automatically optimizes your articles for iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Vision Pro to give your readers the best experience for their device.
