# withBorrowedName(body:)

**Framework:** System  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 17.4+ · iPadOS 17.4+ · Mac Catalyst 17.4+ · macOS 14.4+ · tvOS 17.4+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 10.4+

Borrow access to the port name in a block that can perform non-consuming operations.

## Declaration

```swift
func withBorrowedName<ReturnType>(body: (mach_port_name_t) -> ReturnType) -> ReturnType
```

<a id="discussion"></a>

## Discussion

Take care when using this function; many operations consume rights, and send-once rights are easily consumed.

If the right is consumed, behavior is undefined.

The body block may optionally return something, which will then be returned to the caller of withBorrowedName.
