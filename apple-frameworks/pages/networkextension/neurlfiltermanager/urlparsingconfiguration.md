# urlParsingConfiguration

**Framework:** Network Extension  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 27.0+ · iPadOS 27.0+ · Mac Catalyst 27.0+ · macOS 27.0+

A property to configure the filter’s parser behavior.

## Declaration

```swift
var urlParsingConfiguration: NEURLFilterManager.ParsingConfiguration { get set }
```

## Discussion

Use this property to control which URL components to exclude, and to customize parsing behavior during sub-URL enumeration. This determines how the filter parses URLs which sub-URLs it generates for matching against the filter data set.

For any excluded component – domain, path, query, or fragment –  the filter substitutes `"%*"` in place as a placeholder. By contrast, if you strip the domain or `www` subdomain, they’re removed entirely without a placeholder, since URL matching doesn’t typically require them.

As an example, consider the URL `https://www.example.com/a/b/c?id=123#fragment` and a configuration set as follows:

```swift
var config = manager.urlParsingConfiguration
config.excludeScheme = true
config.domain.stripWWW = true
config.path.excluded = true
manager.urlParsingConfiguration = config
```

The parsing result is `example.com/%*?id=123#fragment`, where `"%*"` acts as the placeholder for the excluded path component. The presence of a placeholder indicates the original URL contained that component, but the parsing configuration excluded it.

If the filter manager sets [urlParsingRegularExpression](urlparsingregularexpression.md), this configuration has no effect.
