# includedNetworkRules (Swift)

**Framework:** Network Extension  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** macOS 10.15+

An array of rules that collectively specify what traffic to route through the transparent proxy.

## Declaration

```swift
var includedNetworkRules: [NENetworkRule]? { get set }
```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

The following restrictions apply to each rule in the array:

- If the port string of the endpoint is `0` or is the empty string, then the address of the endpoint must be a non-wildcard address, such as `0.0.0.0` or `::`.
- If the address is a wildcard address (such as `0.0.0.0` or `::)`, then the port string of the endpoint must be non-empty and must not be `0`.
- A port string of `53` is not allowed. Use Destination Domain-based rules to match DNS traffic.
- The [matchLocalNetwork](../nenetworkrule/matchlocalnetwork.md) property must be `nil`.
- The [matchDirection](../nenetworkrule/matchdirection.md) property must be [NETrafficDirection.outbound](../netrafficdirection/outbound.md).
