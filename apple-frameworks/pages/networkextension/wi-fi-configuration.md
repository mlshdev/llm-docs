# Wi-Fi configuration

**Interface languages:** Swift, Objective-C

**Framework:** Network Extension  
**Kind:** API Collection

Add persistent Wi-Fi configurations, or temporarily move the device to a specific Wi-Fi network.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Using [NEHotspotConfigurationManager](nehotspotconfigurationmanager.md), you can programmatically create two different types of Wi-Fi configurations:

- Persistent configurations, which are equivalent to the user joining a Wi-Fi network using the Settings app
- Join-once configurations, which temporarily move the device to a specific Wi-Fi network

The user must explicitly authorize both of these operations.

This API can help with a wide variety of tasks. For example, you can use it to help a user join a specific Wi-Fi network, like the hotspot at a local coffee shop, or to set up an accessory that uses Wi-Fi.

[NEHotspotConfigurationManager](nehotspotconfigurationmanager.md) supports a variety of authentication models:

- SSID with no authentication
- SSID with password-based authentication (WEP, WPA, and WPA2)
- SSID with EAP authentication
- Hotspot 2.0 with EAP authentication

[NEHotspotConfigurationManager](nehotspotconfigurationmanager.md) is only supported on iOS. For macOS, use the [Core WLAN](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corewlan) framework, which provides a full-featured Wi-Fi configuration and management API.
