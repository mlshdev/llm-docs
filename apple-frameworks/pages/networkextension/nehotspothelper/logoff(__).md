# logoff(\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Network Extension  
**Kind:** Type Method  
**Availability:** iOS 9.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · iPadOS 9.0+ (deprecated in 26.0) · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ (deprecated in 26.0) · visionOS 1.0+ (deprecated in 26.0)

Terminate the authentication session for a Hotspot network.

> Use NEHotspotManager API

## Declaration

```swift
class func logoff(_ network: NEHotspotNetwork) -> Bool
```

## Parameters

- `network`: A [NEHotspotNetwork](../nehotspotnetwork.md) corresponding to the currently associated Wi-Fi network.

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

[true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true) if the logoff command was successfully queued, [false](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false) otherwise.

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

The application invokes this method when it wants to log off from the current network. Invoking this method causes an [NEHotspotHelperCommand](../nehotspothelpercommand.md) of type [NEHotspotHelperCommandType.logoff](../nehotspothelpercommandtype/logoff.md) to be issued to the application’s ‘handler’ block, which is registered with the system by calling `NEHotspotHelper registerWithOptions:queue:handler`.

The `network` parameter must correspond to the currently associated Wi-Fi network i.e. it must have come from the `network` property of the [NEHotspotHelperCommand](../nehotspothelpercommand.md) or from the `supportedInterfaces` method.

> **Warning**

>  The application must not actually log off from the network until it receives the command to log off.
