This method returns immediately after starting the process of connecting the tunnel. In order to be notified when the tunnel is fully connected, register to observe the [NEVPNStatusDidChangeNotification](../nevpnstatusdidchangenotification.md) notification on the `NETunnelProviderSession` object and examine its status property when the notification is received.

> **Handling Errors in Swift**
