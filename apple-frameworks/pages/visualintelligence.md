## Overview

People use visual intelligence to learn about places and objects around them and onscreen. By pointing their visual intelligence camera at their surroundings and tapping the search button, or by selecting objects in a screenshot, people can search for matching content in apps that offer integration with visual intelligence. Matches appear in the visual intelligence experience, allowing people to view and open items, or see additional search results in the corresponding app. For example, an app that provides information about landmarks can integrate with visual intelligence to allow people to view information about a landmark or open the app for more information.

To integrate your app with visual intelligence and include your app’s content in search results, use the Visual Intelligence framework and [App Intents](appintents.md). The Visual Intelligence framework provides you with information captured by visual intelligence, and your app uses the App Intents framework to receive the information and return matching content to the system and visual intelligence.
