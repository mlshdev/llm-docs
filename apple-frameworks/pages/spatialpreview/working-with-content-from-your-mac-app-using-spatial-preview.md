## Overview

The Spatial Preview framework enables Mac apps to send content to a nearby Apple Vision Pro so people can view it spatially and immersively. This sample includes two examples that illustrate the main session types:

- **`DocumentPreviewSession`**: A spatial photo gallery example that streams stereo HEIC images to Apple Vision Pro so people can browse spatial photos immersively without leaving the Mac workflow.
- **`USDPreviewSession`**: A 3D interior design example that uses USD to adjust furniture layouts live with override layers, and an asset-review workflow that uses text annotations.
