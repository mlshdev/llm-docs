## Discussion

Call this method to transition to a different experience such as [AVExperienceController.Experience.expanded](experience-swift.enum/expanded.md). When you initiate a transition, the system calls the experience controller’s delegate methods so your app can respond to experience changes.

You determine the success of a transition by evaluating the [AVExperienceController.TransitionContext.TransitionResult](transitioncontext/transitionresult.md) this method returns. A transition result of [AVExperienceController.TransitionContext.TransitionResult.completed](transitioncontext/transitionresult/completed.md) indicates a successful transition, in which case the system updates the [experience](experience-swift.property.md) property to the new experience. A transition result of [AVExperienceController.TransitionContext.TransitionResult.reversed(reason:)](transitioncontext/transitionresult/reversed%28reason_%29.md) indicates a failed transition. Evaluate the result’s [AVExperienceController.TransitionContext.ReversedReason](transitioncontext/reversedreason.md) to determine why the transition failed. A failure that occurs before the transition begins results in the system not invoking any delegate callback methods. If the failure happens after the callback to  [experienceController(\_:prepareForTransitionUsing:)](delegate-swift.protocol/experiencecontroller%28__preparefortransitionusing_%29.md) occurs, the transition context changes to [AVExperienceController.TransitionContext.Status.finished(result:)](transitioncontext/status-swift.enum/finished%28result_%29.md).
