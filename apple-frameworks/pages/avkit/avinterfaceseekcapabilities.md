## Topics

### Enumeration Cases

- [AVInterfaceSeekCapabilitiesNone](avinterfaceseekcapabilities/avinterfaceseekcapabilitiesnone.md): The source does not support any scanning or seeking operations.
- [AVInterfaceSeekCapabilitiesScanBackward](avinterfaceseekcapabilities/avinterfaceseekcapabilitiesscanbackward.md): The source supports backward scanning at accelerated rates for rewind operations. Enables rapid reverse progression through content at speeds greater than normal playback.
- [AVInterfaceSeekCapabilitiesScanForward](avinterfaceseekcapabilities/avinterfaceseekcapabilitiesscanforward.md): The source supports forward scanning at accelerated rates for fast-forward operations. Enables rapid progression through content at speeds greater than normal playback.
- [AVInterfaceSeekCapabilitiesSeek](avinterfaceseekcapabilities/avinterfaceseekcapabilitiesseek.md): The source supports seeking to specific time positions for precise navigation. Enables jumping directly to any arbitrary point within the seekable time ranges.
