## Discussion

For on-demand content, `start` is typically zero and `duration` is the total length of the content.

For live content without DVR, set [timeRange](timerange.md) to a zero-duration range at the current live edge and advance it as the edge moves; [seekableTimeRanges](seekabletimeranges.md) must be nil or empty.

For live content with DVR, set [timeRange](timerange.md) to the available DVR window and advance both `start` and `end` as the window rolls. Use [seekableTimeRanges](seekabletimeranges.md) to indicate which portion is seekable.

The duration is always a finite, non-negative value.
