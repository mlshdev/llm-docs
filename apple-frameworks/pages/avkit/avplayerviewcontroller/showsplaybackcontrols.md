# showsPlaybackControls (Swift)

**Framework:** AVKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ · iPadOS 8.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

A Boolean value that indicates whether the player view controller shows playback controls.

## Declaration

```swift
var showsPlaybackControls: Bool { get set }
```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

Set this property to `false` if you don’t want the system-provided playback controls visible over your content. Hiding the playback controls can be useful in situations where you need a non-interactive video presentation, such as a video splash screen.

The default value is `true`.

> **Important**

>  Don’t use this property to change the visibility of the playback controls while the player view controller is onscreen. Doing so creates or destroys user interface elements.
