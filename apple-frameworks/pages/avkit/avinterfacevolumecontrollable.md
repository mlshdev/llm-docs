### Instance Properties

- [hasAudio](avinterfacevolumecontrollable/hasaudio.md): Indicates whether the media contains audio tracks and can produce sound output. Returns NO for video-only content, silent content, or when audio tracks are unavailable. Must be key-value observable.
- [muted](avinterfacevolumecontrollable/muted.md): Controls whether audio output is temporarily silenced. When YES, audio is muted regardless of the volume level setting. Must be key-value observable.
- [volume](avinterfacevolumecontrollable/volume.md): The audio output level as a normalized value between 0.0 (completely silent) and 1.0 (maximum system volume). This value is independent of the muted state and represents the user’s volume preference. Must be key-value observable.
