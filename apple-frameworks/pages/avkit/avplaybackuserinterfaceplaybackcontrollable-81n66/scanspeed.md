The speed multiplier used during scanning (fast-forward or rewind). This is a transient override that is active only while `state` is scanning. It does not affect `playbackSpeed`. When scanning ends, playback resumes at `playbackSpeed`. Must be key-value observable.

```objectivec
@property (nonatomic, readwrite) float scanSpeed;
```
