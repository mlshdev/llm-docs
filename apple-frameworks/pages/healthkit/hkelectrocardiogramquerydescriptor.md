# HKElectrocardiogramQueryDescriptor

**Framework:** HealthKit  
**Kind:** Structure  
**Availability:** iOS 15.4+ · iPadOS 15.4+ · Mac Catalyst 15.4+ · macOS 13.0+ · visionOS · watchOS 8.5+

A query interface that reads the underlying voltage measurements for an electrocardiogram sample using Swift concurrency.

## Declaration

```swift
struct HKElectrocardiogramQueryDescriptor
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Use [HKElectrocardiogramQueryDescriptor](hkelectrocardiogramquerydescriptor.md) to access the individual voltage measurements associated with an [HKElectrocardiogram](hkelectrocardiogram.md) sample. To read the individual voltage measurements, create an electrocardiogram query descriptor using the desired sample, and then call the [results(for:)](hkheartbeatseriesquerydescriptor/results%28for_%29.md) method on the descriptor.

```swift
// Create the descriptor.
let ecgDescriptor = HKElectrocardiogramQueryDescriptor(myElectrocardiogram)

// Get the AsyncSequence that returns individual voltage measurements.
let voltages = ecgDescriptor.results(for: store)

// Access each voltage measurement.
for try await measurement in voltages {
    
    // Process the results here.
    print(measurement.quantity(for: .appleWatchSimilarToLeadI) ?? "No Measurement")
    print(measurement.timeSinceSampleStart)
}
```

While this method returns an [AsyncSequence](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/asyncsequence), unlike the long-running queries, this sequence has a finite size. Iterating over the sequence asynchronously returns voltage measurements, automatically terminating after you receive all the measurements.

## Topics

### Creating Electrocardiogram Query Descriptors

- [init(\_:)](hkelectrocardiogramquerydescriptor/init%28__%29.md): Creates a query descriptor that reads voltage measurements from the provided electrocardiogram sample.

### Running Queries

- [results(for:)](hkelectrocardiogramquerydescriptor/results%28for_%29.md): Runs a one-shot query that returns an asynchronous sequence of data representing individual heartbeats.
- [HKElectrocardiogramQueryDescriptor.Results](hkelectrocardiogramquerydescriptor/results.md): An asynchronous sequence that emits data about individual voltage measurements from an electrocardiogram sample.

### Accessing Query Properties

- [electrocardiogram](hkelectrocardiogramquerydescriptor/electrocardiogram.md): The sample that contains the voltage measurements.

### Default Implementations
