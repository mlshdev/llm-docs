# lowCardioFitnessEvent (Swift)

**Framework:** HealthKit  
**Kind:** Type Property  
**Availability:** iOS 14.3+ · iPadOS 14.3+ · Mac Catalyst 14.3+ · macOS 13.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 7.2+

An event that indicates the user’s VO2 max values consistently fall below a particular aerobic fitness threshold.

## Declaration

```swift
static let lowCardioFitnessEvent: HKCategoryTypeIdentifier
```

## Discussion

In iOS 14.3 and later, users with a paired Apple Watch running watchOS 7.2 or later can enable a Health app experience that classifies their cardio fitness levels as either “Low”, “Below Average”, “Above Average”, or “High”, based on individual parameters and characteristics.

Apple Watch can notify the user when their cardio fitness level falls into the Low category. If the user enables these notifications, they receive a notification when their VO2 max levels consistently fall below the low threshold for a period of time. The system sends low-cardio fitness notifications approximately once every four months.

The system also creates a [lowCardioFitnessEvent](lowcardiofitnessevent.md) sample to record the event. The sample contains  values from the [HKCategoryValueLowCardioFitnessEvent](../hkcategoryvaluelowcardiofitnessevent.md) enumeration.

Samples of this type have two associated metadata keys:

- **[HKMetadataKeyVO2MaxValue](../hkmetadatakeyvo2maxvalue.md)**: This key stores the value of the VO2 max sample that triggered the event.
- **[HKMetadataKeyLowCardioFitnessEventThreshold](../hkmetadatakeylowcardiofitnesseventthreshold.md)**: This key stores the threshold value used to calculate the Low cardio classification. This value varies based on certain parameters and physical characteristics, such as the user’s age.

Low-cardio fitness event samples are read-only. Use this identifier to request permission to read these samples; however, you can’t request authorization to share them, and you can’t save new low-cardio fitness event samples to the HealthKit store.
