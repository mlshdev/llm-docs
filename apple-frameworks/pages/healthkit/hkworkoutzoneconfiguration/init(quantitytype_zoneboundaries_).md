## Discussion

The system creates the individual zones based on the boundaries you provide. This method ensures that zones are contiguous and nonoverlapping. Call this method before calling [setCustomZoneConfiguration(\_:for:)](../hkworkoutbuilder/setcustomzoneconfiguration%28__for_%29.md) to apply custom zones to a workout.
