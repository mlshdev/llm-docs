# walkingDoubleSupportPercentage (Swift)

**Framework:** HealthKit  
**Kind:** Type Property  
**Availability:** iOS 14.0+ · iPadOS 14.0+ · Mac Catalyst 14.0+ · macOS 13.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 7.0+

A quantity sample type that measures the percentage of time when both of the user’s feet touch the ground while walking steadily over flat ground.

## Declaration

```swift
static let walkingDoubleSupportPercentage: HKQuantityTypeIdentifier
```

## Discussion

These samples measure the percentage of time during a walk that both of the user’s feet are on the ground. A lower value indicates that the user spends more time with the weight on just one foot instead of two. During a typical walk, this measure falls between 20% and 40%. Double support time varies depending on how fast the user walks and the terrain.

The system automatically records double support samples on iPhone 8 or later. The user must carry their phone near their waist—such as in a pocket—and walk steadily on flat ground. The system records 10 to 30 walking double support samples on a typical day. iPhone doesn’t record double support samples if the user’s wheelchair status is on.

These samples use percentage units (described in [HKUnit](../hkunit.md)) and measure discrete values (described in [HKQuantityAggregationStyle](../hkquantityaggregationstyle.md)). For example, the following code creates a percentage unit.

```swift
let percentage = HKUnit.percent()
```

The sample’s [quantity](../hkquantitysample/quantity.md) property represents the percent of time the user had weight on both feet between the sample’s [startDate](../hksample/startdate.md) and [endDate](../hksample/enddate.md) properties.
