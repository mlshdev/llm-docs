# physicalEffort (Swift)

**Framework:** HealthKit  
**Kind:** Type Property  
**Availability:** iOS 17.0+ · iPadOS 17.0+ · Mac Catalyst 17.0+ · macOS 14.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 10.0+

A quantity sample type that measures the estimated amount of energy being used to perform a task excluding other factors such as temperature, altitude, or heart rate.

## Declaration

```swift
static let physicalEffort: HKQuantityTypeIdentifier
```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

These samples use power in Metabolic Equivalent of Task (METs) units (described in [HKUnit](../hkunit.md)) and measure discrete values (described in [HKQuantityAggregationStyle](../hkquantityaggregationstyle.md)). Physical effort is estimated and recorded automatically by Apple Watch.
