# HKWorkoutEventType.lap (Swift)

**Framework:** HealthKit  
**Kind:** Case  
**Availability:** iOS 10.0+ · iPadOS 10.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 13.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 3.0+

## Discussion

Lap events partition a workout into segments of equal distance (for example, laps around a track or laps in a pool). The lap’s [dateInterval](../hkworkoutevent/dateinterval.md) property should mark the start and end of the lap. Lap events can’t overlap.

When you receive lap events from the HealthKit store, examine the event’s [dateInterval](../hkworkoutevent/dateinterval.md) property to interpret the lap correctly:

**Zero-duration intervals.** Older lap events (created before iOS 11 and watchOS 4) have a zero-duration date interval that marks the end of the lap. Each lap is assumed to start when the previous lap ends, and laps fill the entire workout completely.\*\*\*\*

**Nonzero-duration intervals.** Newer lap events use the date interval to mark the start and the duration of the lap. These events have a nonzero duration, and they do not need to fill the workout; however, you should ideally mark any rest periods between laps using [HKWorkoutEventType.pause](pause.md) and [HKWorkoutEventType.resume](resume.md) events.
