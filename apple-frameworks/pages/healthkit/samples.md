# Samples (Swift)

**Framework:** HealthKit  
**Kind:** API Collection

Create and save health and fitness samples.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

The HealthKit store saves most health and fitness data using [HKSample](hksample.md) subclasses. All sample subclasses record information at a specified time. If the sample’s [startDate](hksample/startdate.md) and [endDate](hksample/enddate.md) properties are the same, the sample represents a point in time. If the [endDate](hksample/enddate.md) is after the [startDate](hksample/startdate.md), the sample represents a time interval.

HealthKit uses different [HKSample](hksample.md) subclasses to store different types of data:

- [HKQuantitySample](hkquantitysample.md) objects store quantities—a numerical value and units. Most HealthKit data types use quantity samples. For example, height, heart rate, and dietary energy consumed all use quantity samples.
- [HKCategorySample](hkcategorysample.md) objects store a single option selected from a short list. For example, category samples record sleep data (the user can be in bed, asleep, or awake).
- [HKCorrelation](hkcorrelation.md) samples combine two or more samples into a single value. For example, correlation samples represent food intake and blood pressure samples. A food sample contains any number of nutrition samples, while a blood pressure sample contains both a systolic and a diastolic sample.
- HealthKit represents specialized data types with sample subclasses such as [HKCDADocumentSample](hkcdadocumentsample.md), [HKWorkoutRoute](hkworkoutroute.md), and [HKWorkout](hkworkout.md).
