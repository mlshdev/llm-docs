# authorizationViewControllerPresenter (Swift)

**Framework:** HealthKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 17.0+ · iPadOS 17.0+ · Mac Catalyst 17.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

The view controller that presents HealthKit authorization sheets.

## Declaration

```swift
weak var authorizationViewControllerPresenter: UIViewController? { get set }
```

## Discussion

By default, the system infers the correct view controller to show HealthKit’s authorization sheet. In some cases, you can improve the user experience by explicitly defining how the system presents the authentication sheets. In particular, consider setting this property when using HealthKit in an iPadOS app.
