## Discussion

Typically, you call this method only when the [prepareForActivation()](prepareforactivation%28%29.md) method delivers the [GroupActivityActivationResult.activationPreferred](../groupactivityactivationresult/activationpreferred.md) result. However, you may call it directly if your activity only makes sense in a group setting. For example, call it if the activity applies only to groups and can’t be performed without other participants.

If a FaceTime call is active, this method configures a session. The system also invites other participants to join the activity. If a session will be delivered to your app this function returns true, otherwise it returns false. A case where this function could return false is when a session is created and handed off to an Apple TV. If a call isn’t active or a session wasn’t created, this method throws an error
