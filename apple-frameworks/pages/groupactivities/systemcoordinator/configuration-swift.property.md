## Discussion

This property stores the [SystemCoordinator](../systemcoordinator.md) object’s current support for displaying spatial Personas and placing them and your content in a shared simulation space. Assign a new value to this property to support spatial Personas and shared context in the current activity. The default configuration doesn’t enable support for these features.
