# ImageAnalyzer

**Framework:** VisionKit  
**Kind:** Class  
**Availability:** iOS 16.0+ · iPadOS 16.0+ · Mac Catalyst 17.0+ · macOS 13.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

An object that finds items in images that people can interact with, such as subjects, text, and QR codes.

## Declaration

```swift
final class ImageAnalyzer
```

## Overview

To use an `ImageAnalyzer` object, first create an [ImageAnalyzer.Configuration](imageanalyzer/configuration.md) object, and specify the types of items you want to find in an image. Then pass the image you want to analyze and the configuration object to an `ImageAnalyzer` object using the [analyze(\_:configuration:)](imageanalyzer/analyze%28__configuration_%29.md) or similar method. This method returns an [ImageAnalysis](imageanalysis.md) object that contains all the data VisionKit needs to implement the Live Text interface.

Next, show the Live Text interface. For iOS apps, set the interaction object of the view that contains the image to an instance of [ImageAnalysisInteraction](imageanalysisinteraction.md) and set its [analysis](imageanalysisinteraction/analysis.md) property to the `ImageAnalysis` object. To enable interactions with the image, set the interaction object’s [preferredInteractionTypes](imageanalysisinteraction/preferredinteractiontypes.md) property. To customize the Live Text interface, set the `ImageAnalysisInteraction `object’s [delegate](imageanalysisinteraction/delegate.md) property and implement the [ImageAnalysisInteractionDelegate](imageanalysisinteractiondelegate.md) protocol methods.

For macOS apps, add an `ImageAnalysisOverlayView` object above the view that contains the image, and set its `analysis` property. To enable interactions with the image, set the overlay view’s `preferredInteractionTypes` property. Set the `ImageAnalysisOverlayView `object’s `delegate` property and implement the `ImageAnalysisOverlayViewDelegate` protocol methods.

By default, the Live Text interface starts immediately when you show the view.

## Topics

### Handling availability

- [isSupported](imageanalyzer/issupported.md): A Boolean value that indicates whether the device supports image analysis.
- [supportedTextRecognitionLanguages](imageanalyzer/supportedtextrecognitionlanguages.md): The identifiers for the languages that the image analyzer recognizes.

### Creating image analyzers

- [init()](imageanalyzer/init%28%29.md): Creates an image analyzer that identifies subjects, text, and machine-readable codes in images.

### Configuring image analyzers

- [ImageAnalyzer.Configuration](imageanalyzer/configuration.md): A configuration that specifies the types of items and locales that the image analyzer recognizes.

### Finding items in images

- [analyze(\_:configuration:)](imageanalyzer/analyze%28__configuration_%29.md): Returns the data for providing a Live Text interaction with an image.
- [analyze(\_:orientation:configuration:)](imageanalyzer/analyze%28__orientation_configuration_%29-5bs2w.md): Returns the data for providing a Live Text interaction with an image in the specified orientation.
- [analyze(\_:orientation:configuration:)](imageanalyzer/analyze%28__orientation_configuration_%29-ufrs.md): Returns the data for providing a Live Text interaction with a Core Graphics image in the specified orientation.
- [analyze(\_:orientation:configuration:)](imageanalyzer/analyze%28__orientation_configuration_%29-2ezqw.md): Returns the data for providing a Live Text interaction with a pixel buffer image in the specified orientation.
- [analyze(\_:orientation:configuration:)](imageanalyzer/analyze%28__orientation_configuration_%29-4h43g.md): Returns the data for providing a Live Text interaction with a bitmap image in the specified orientation.
- [analyze(\_:orientation:configuration:)](imageanalyzer/analyze%28__orientation_configuration_%29-fcjz.md): Returns the data for providing a Live Text interaction with an image in the specified orientation.
- [analyze(imageAt:orientation:configuration:)](imageanalyzer/analyze%28imageat_orientation_configuration_%29.md): Returns the data for providing a Live Text interaction with an image at a URL and in the specified orientation.
