## Discussion

You need to set this property to enable interactions with the image. If this property contains [automatic](interactiontypes/automatic.md), the interaction ignores the other types in the set. The default value for this property is an empty array that disables any interactions.

If you set this property to one or more types, the interaction sets the view’s [isUserInteractionEnabled](../../uikit/uiview/isuserinteractionenabled.md) property to `true` so that the interaction begins. For example, when you’re ready to start the Live Text interface, set this property to [automatic](interactiontypes/automatic.md).

If you set this property to an empty array, the image analysis interaction doesn’t reset the view’s `isUserInteractionEnabled` property to `false`.
