# insertingIntermediate(cache:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Image  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 12.0+ · iPadOS 12.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.14+ · tvOS 12.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

Create an image that inserts a intermediate that is cacheable.

## Declaration

```swift
func insertingIntermediate(cache: Bool) -> CIImage
```

## Parameters

- `cache`: Controls if Core Image caches the returned image. If `true`, this intermediate will be cacheable even if [cacheIntermediates](../cicontextoption/cacheintermediates.md) is false. If `false`, the intermediate will be not be cached if [cacheIntermediates](../cicontextoption/cacheintermediates.md) is false.
