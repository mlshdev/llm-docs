# oriented(forExifOrientation:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Image  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ · iPadOS 8.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.10+ · tvOS · visionOS 1.0+

Returns a new image created by transforming the original image to the specified EXIF orientation.

## Declaration

```swift
func oriented(forExifOrientation orientation: Int32) -> CIImage
```

## Parameters

- `orientation`: An integer specifying an image orientation according to the EXIF specification. For details, see [kCGImagePropertyOrientation](../../imageio/kcgimagepropertyorientation.md).

## Return Value

An image object representing the result of rotating or mirroring the image to the target orientation.

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

This method determines and then applies the transformation needed to reorient the image to the specified orientation. If you plan to also apply other transformations, you can retrieve the transformation this method would use by calling the [orientationTransform(forExifOrientation:)](orientationtransform%28forexiforientation_%29.md) method.
