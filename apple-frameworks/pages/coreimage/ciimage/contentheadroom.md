# contentHeadroom (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Image  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 18.0+ · iPadOS 18.0+ · Mac Catalyst 18.0+ · macOS 15.0+ · tvOS 18.0+ · visionOS 2.0+

Returns the content headroom of the image.

## Declaration

```swift
var contentHeadroom: Float { get }
```

## Discussion

If the image headroom is unknown, then the value 0.0 will be returned.

If the image headroom is known, then a value greater than or equal to 1.0 will be returned. A value of 1.0 will be returned if the image is SDR. A value greater than 1.0 will be returned if the image is HDR.

The image headroom may known when a CIImage is first initialized. If the a CIImage is initialized using:

- `NSURL` or `NSData` : the headroom may be determined by associated metadata or deduced from pixel format or colorSpace information.
- `CGImage` : headroom may be determined by `CGImageGetHeadroomInfo()` or deduced from pixel format or colorSpace information.
- `IOSurface` : then the headroom will be determined by `kIOSurfaceContentHeadroom`. or deduced from pixel format or colorSpace information.
- `CVPixelBuffer` : then the headroom will be determined by `kCVImageBufferContentLightLevelInfoKey`. or deduced from pixel format or colorSpace information.
- `BitmapData` : headroom may be deduced from pixel format or colorSpace information.

If the image is the result of applying a [CIFilter](../cifilter-swift.class.md) or [CIKernel](../cikernel.md), this method will return `0.0`.

There are exceptions to this.  Applying a ```CIWarpKernel`` or certain ``CIFilter-class``  (e.g. ```CIGaussianBlur`, `CILanczosScaleTransform`, `CIAreaAverage```and some others)  to an image will result in a ``CIImage`` instance with the same```contentHeadroom\` property value.

### Instance Properties

- [isOpaque](isopaque.md): Returns YES if the image is known to have and alpha value of `1.0` over the entire image extent.
- [metalTexture](metaltexture.md)
