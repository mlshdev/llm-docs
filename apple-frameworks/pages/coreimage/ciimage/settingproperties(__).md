# settingProperties(\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Image  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 10.0+ · iPadOS 10.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.12+ · tvOS 10.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

Return a new image by changing the receiver’s metadata properties.

## Declaration

```swift
func settingProperties(_ properties: [AnyHashable : Any]) -> CIImage
```

## Parameters

- `properties`: A dictionary of metadata properties akin to the `CGImageSourceCopyPropertiesAtIndex()` function.

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

 An autoreleased [CIImage](../ciimage.md) instance with a copy of the new properties.

## Discussion

When you create an image, Core Image sets an image’s properties to a metadata dictionary as described here: [properties](properties.md). Use this method to override an image’s metadata properties with new values.
