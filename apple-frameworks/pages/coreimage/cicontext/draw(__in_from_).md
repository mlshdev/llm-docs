# draw(\_:in:from:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Image  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 5.0+ · iPadOS 5.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.4+ · tvOS · visionOS 1.0+

Renders a region of an image to a rectangle in the context destination.

## Declaration

```swift
func draw(_ image: CIImage, in inRect: CGRect, from fromRect: CGRect)
```

## Parameters

- `image`: A Core Image image object.
- `inRect`: The rectangle in the context destination to draw into. The image is scaled to fill the destination rectangle.
- `fromRect`: The subregion of the image that you want to draw into the context, with the origin and target size defined by the `dest` parameter. This rectangle is always in pixel dimensions.

## Discussion

In iOS, this method draws the `CIImage` object into a renderbuffer for the OpenGL ES context. Use this method only if the [CIContext](../cicontext.md) object is created with `contextWithEAGLContext:`  and if you are rendering to a CAEAGLayer. This method is asynchronous for apps linked against the iOS 6 or later SDK.

In macOS, you need to be aware of whether the [CIContext](../cicontext.md) object is created with a `CGContextRef` or a `CGLContext` object. If you create the [CIContext](../cicontext.md) object with a `CGContextRef`, the dimensions of the destination rectangle are in points. If you create the [CIContext](../cicontext.md) object with a `CGLContext` object, the dimensions are in pixels.
