# isLuminanceNoiseReductionSupported (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Image  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 15.0+ · iPadOS 15.0+ · Mac Catalyst 15.0+ · macOS 12.0+ · tvOS 15.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

A Boolean that indicates if the current image supports luminance noise reduction adjustments.

## Declaration

```swift
var isLuminanceNoiseReductionSupported: Bool { get }
```

## Discussion

If this value is `true`, you can adjust the amount of luminance noise reduction to apply to the image by setting [luminanceNoiseReductionAmount](luminancenoisereductionamount.md).
