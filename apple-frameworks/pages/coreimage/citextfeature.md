# CITextFeature (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Image  
**Kind:** Class  
**Availability:** iOS 9.0+ · iPadOS 9.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.11+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

Information about a text that was detected in a still or video image.

## Declaration

```swift
class CITextFeature
```

## Overview

> **Note**

> In macOS 10.13, iOS 11, and tvOS 11 or later, the Vision framework replaces these classes for identifying and analyzing image features. See [VNRecognizeTextRequest](../vision/vnrecognizetextrequest.md))

A detected text feature is not necessarily rectangular in the plane of the image; rather, the feature identifies a shape that may be rectangular in space (for example a text on a sign) but which appears as a four-sided polygon in the image. The properties of a `CITextFeature` object identify its four corners in image coordinates.

To detect text in an image or video, choose the [CIDetectorTypeText](cidetectortypetext.md) type when initializing a [CIDetector](cidetector.md) object, and use the `CIDetectorImageOrientation` option to specify the desired orientation for finding upright text.

## Topics

### Locating a Detected Feature

- [bounds](citextfeature/bounds.md): A rectangle that indicates the position and extent of the text feature in image coordinates.

### Locating Features Within a Detected Region

- [subFeatures](citextfeature/subfeatures.md): An array containing additional features detected within the feature.

### Identifying the Corners of a Detected Text Region

- [bottomLeft](citextfeature/bottomleft.md): The image coordinate of the lower-left corner of the detected text.
- [bottomRight](citextfeature/bottomright.md): The image coordinate of the lower-right corner of the detected text.
- [topLeft](citextfeature/topleft.md): The image coordinate of the upper-left corner of the detected text.
- [topRight](citextfeature/topright.md): The image coordinate of the upper-right corner of the detected text.
