# CIImageProcessorInput (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Image  
**Kind:** Protocol  
**Availability:** iOS 10.0+ · iPadOS 10.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.12+ · tvOS 10.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

A container of image data and information for use in a custom image processor.

## Declaration

```swift
protocol CIImageProcessorInput
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Your app does not define classes that adopt this protocol; Core Image provides an object of this type when applying a custom image processor you create with a [CIImageProcessorKernel](ciimageprocessorkernel.md) subclass.

In your image processor class’ [process(with:arguments:output:)](ciimageprocessorkernel/process%28with_arguments_output_%29.md) method, use the provided `CIImageProcessorInput` object to access the image data and supporting information to perform your custom image processing routine. For example, if you process the image using a Metal shader, use the [metalTexture](ciimageprocessorinput/metaltexture.md) property to bind the image as an input texture. Or, if you process the image using a CPU-based routine, use the [baseAddress](ciimageprocessorinput/baseaddress.md) property to access pixel data in memory.

To finish setting up or performing your image processing routine, use the provided [CIImageProcessorOutput](ciimageprocessoroutput.md) object to return processed pixel data to Core Image.

## Topics

### Accessing Input Image Data

- [baseAddress](ciimageprocessorinput/baseaddress.md): The base address of CPU memory that your Core Image Processor Kernel can read pixels from.
- [metalTexture](ciimageprocessorinput/metaltexture.md): A MTLTexture object that can be bound for input using Metal.
- [pixelBuffer](ciimageprocessorinput/pixelbuffer.md): An input pixel buffer object that your Core Image Processor Kernel can read from.
- [surface](ciimageprocessorinput/surface.md): An input surface object that your Core Image Processor Kernel can read from.

### Getting Supplemental Information for Image Processing

- [region](ciimageprocessorinput/region.md): The rectangular region of the input image that your Core Image Processor Kernel can use to provide the output.
- [bytesPerRow](ciimageprocessorinput/bytesperrow.md): The bytes per row of the CPU memory that your Core Image Processor Kernel can read pixelsfrom.
- [format](ciimageprocessorinput/format.md): The pixel format of the CPU memory that your Core Image Processor Kernel can read pixels from.

### Instance Properties

- [digest](ciimageprocessorinput/digest.md): A 64-bit digest that uniquely describes the contents of the input to a processor.
- [roiTileCount](ciimageprocessorinput/roitilecount.md): This property tells a tiled-input processor how many input tiles will be processed.
- [roiTileIndex](ciimageprocessorinput/roitileindex.md): This property tells a tiled-input processor which input tile index is being processed.

## See Also

### Custom Image Processors

- [CIImageProcessorKernel](ciimageprocessorkernel.md): The abstract class you extend to create custom image processors that can integrate with Core Image workflows.
- [CIImageProcessorOutput](ciimageprocessoroutput.md): A container for writing image data and information produced by a custom image processor.
