# kaleidoscope() (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Image  
**Kind:** Type Method  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 13.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

Creates a 12-way kaleidoscopic image from an image.

## Declaration

```swift
class func kaleidoscope() -> any CIFilter & CIKaleidoscope
```

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

The tiled image.

## Discussion

This method applies the kaleidoscope tile filter to an image. The effect produces a complex 12-way symmetrical reflected pattern from the input image.

The kaleidoscope tile filter uses the following properties:

- **`inputImage`**: An image with the type [CIImage](../ciimage.md).
- **`center`**: A set of coordinates marking the center of the image as a [CGPoint](../../corefoundation/cgpoint.md).
- **`angle`**: A `float` representing the direction of distortion, in radians as an [NSNumber](../../foundation/nsnumber.md).
- **`count`**: A `float` representing the number of reflections in the pattern as an [NSNumber](../../foundation/nsnumber.md).

The following code creates a filter that results in the creation of a kaleidoscope effect from the input image:

```swift
func kaleidoscope(inputImage: CIImage) -> CIImage {
    let kaleidoscopeEffect = CIFilter.kaleidoscope()
    kaleidoscopeEffect.inputImage = inputImage
    kaleidoscopeEffect.count = 6
    kaleidoscopeEffect.center = CGPoint(x: 150, y: 150)
    kaleidoscopeEffect.angle = 0
    return kaleidoscopeEffect.outputImage!
}
```
