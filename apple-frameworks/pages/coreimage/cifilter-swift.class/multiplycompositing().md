## Discussion

This method applies the multiply compositing filter to an image. The effect calculates the color value of the output image by multiplying the color values from the input image and the background image.

The multiply compositing filter uses the following properties:

- **`inputImage`**: An image with the type [CIImage](../ciimage.md).
- **`backgroundImage`**: An image with the type [CIImage](../ciimage.md).

The following code creates a filter that results in the image becoming darker with more saturation:

```swift
func multiplyCompositing(inputImage: CIImage, backgroundImage: CIImage) -> CIImage {
    let colorBlendFilter = CIFilter.multiplyCompositing()
    colorBlendFilter.inputImage = inputImage
    colorBlendFilter.backgroundImage = backgroundImage
    return colorBlendFilter.outputImage!
}
```

The image on the right shows the output from applying a multiply compositing mode filter. The output image displays colors from both images and is darker.](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.coreimage/media-3546400@2x.png)
