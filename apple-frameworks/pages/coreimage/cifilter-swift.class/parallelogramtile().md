# parallelogramTile() (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Image  
**Kind:** Type Method  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 13.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

Warps the image to create a parallelogram and tiles the result.

## Declaration

```swift
class func parallelogramTile() -> any CIFilter & CIParallelogramTile
```

## Return Value

The tiled image.

## Discussion

This method applies the parallelogram tile filter to an image. The effect warps the input image to create a parallelogram and then tiles the result.

The parallelogram tile filter uses the following properties:

- **inputImage**: An image with the type [CIImage](../ciimage.md).
- **`center`**: A set of coordinates marking the center of the image as a [CGPoint](../../corefoundation/cgpoint.md).
- **`angle`**: A `float` representing the direction of distortion, in radians as an [NSNumber](../../foundation/nsnumber.md).
- **`width`**: A `float` representing the set width of each tile as an [NSNumber](../../foundation/nsnumber.md).
- **`acuteAngle`**: A `float` representing the primary angle for the repeating parallelogram tile.

The following code creates a filter that results in the image being cropped to a parallelogram and then tiled:

```swift
func parallelogram(inputImage: CIImage) -> CIImage {
    let parallelogramTile = CIFilter.parallelogramTile()
    parallelogramTile.inputImage = inputImage
    parallelogramTile.center = CGPoint(x: 150, y: 150)
    parallelogramTile.angle = 0
    parallelogramTile.acuteAngle = 1.57
    parallelogramTile.width = 100
    return parallelogramTile.outputImage!
}
```
