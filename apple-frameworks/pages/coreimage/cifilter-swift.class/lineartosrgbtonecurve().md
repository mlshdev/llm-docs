# linearToSRGBToneCurve() (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Image  
**Kind:** Type Method  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 13.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

Alters an image’s color intensity.

## Declaration

```swift
class func linearToSRGBToneCurve() -> any CIFilter & CILinearToSRGBToneCurve
```

## Return Value

The modified image.

## Discussion

This method applies the linear-to-sRGB tone curve filter to an image. The effect converts an image in linear color space to sRGB.

The linear-to-sRGB tone curve filter uses the following properties:

- **`inputImage`**: An image with the type [CIImage](../ciimage.md).

The following code creates a filter that adds brightness to the input image:

```swift
func linearTosRGB(inputImage: CIImage) -> CIImage {
    let linearTosRGB = CIFilter.linearToSRGBToneCurve()
    linearTosRGB.inputImage = inputImage
    return linearTosRGB.outputImage!
}
```
