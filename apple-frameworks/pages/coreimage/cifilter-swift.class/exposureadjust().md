# exposureAdjust() (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Image  
**Kind:** Type Method  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 13.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

Adjusts an image’s exposure.

## Declaration

```swift
class func exposureAdjust() -> any CIFilter & CIExposureAdjust
```

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

The modified image.

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

This method applies the exposure-adjust filter to an image. The effect uses multiplication of color values to simulate the change of exposure within the photo.

The exposure-adjust filter uses the following properties:

- **`ev`**: A `float` representing the amount to adjust the exposure as an [NSNumber](../../foundation/nsnumber.md).
- **`inputImage`**: An image with the type [CIImage](../ciimage.md).

The following code creates a filter that adds brightness to the input image:

```swift
func exposureAdjust(inputImage: CIImage) -> CIImage {
    let exposureAdjustFilter = CIFilter.exposureAdjust()
    exposureAdjustFilter.inputImage = inputImage
    exposureAdjustFilter.ev = 2
    return exposureAdjustFilter.outputImage!
}
```
