# whitePointAdjust() (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Image  
**Kind:** Type Method  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 13.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

Adjusts the image’s white-point.

## Declaration

```swift
class func whitePointAdjust() -> any CIFilter & CIWhitePointAdjust
```

## Return Value

The modified image.

## Discussion

This method applies the white-point adjust filter to an image. The effect adjusts the white-point of the input image by mapping all shades of gray to shades of the color property.

The white-point adjust filter uses the following properties:

- **`color`**: The new white point color with the type of [CIColor](../cicolor.md).
- **`inputImage`**: An image with the type [CIImage](../ciimage.md).

The following code creates a filter that adds a red hue to the input image:

```swift
func whitePoint(inputImage: CIImage) -> CIImage {
    let whitePointFilter = CIFilter.whitePointAdjust()
    whitePointFilter.inputImage = inputImage
    whitePointFilter.color = CIColor(red: 1, green: 0.6, blue: 0.6, alpha: 1)
    return whitePointFilter.outputImage!
}
```
