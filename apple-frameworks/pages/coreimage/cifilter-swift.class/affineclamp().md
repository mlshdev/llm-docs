# affineClamp() (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Image  
**Kind:** Type Method  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 13.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

Performs a transform on the image and extends the image edges to infinity.

## Declaration

```swift
class func affineClamp() -> any CIFilter & CIAffineClamp
```

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

The tiled image.

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

This method applies the affine clamp filter to an image. This effect performs similarly to the affine transform filter except that it produces an infinite image. You can use this filter when you need to blur an image but you want to avoid a soft, black fringe along the edges.

The affine clamp filter uses the following properties:

- **`inputImage`**: An image with the type [CIImage](../ciimage.md).
- **`transform`**: A [CGAffineTransform](../../corefoundation/cgaffinetransform.md) to constrain to the image.

The following code creates a filter that produces a cropped image with colored edges to fill the rest of the image:

```swift
func affineClamp(inputImage: CIImage) -> CIImage {
    let affineClamp = CIFilter.affineClamp()
    affineClamp.inputImage = inputImage
    affineClamp.transform = CGAffineTransform(a: 1.0, b: 0.0, c: 0.0, d: 1.0, tx: 0.0, ty: 0.0)
    return affineClamp.outputImage!
}
```

In the photo on the right, an affine clamp filter is applied, resulting in the edges of the image colors stretching to the edge of the photo.](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.coreimage/media-3624745@2x.png)
