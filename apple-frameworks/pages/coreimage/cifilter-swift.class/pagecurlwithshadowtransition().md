# pageCurlWithShadowTransition() (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Image  
**Kind:** Type Method  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 13.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

Simulates the curl of a page, revealing the target image with added shadow.

## Declaration

```swift
class func pageCurlWithShadowTransition() -> any CIFilter & CIPageCurlWithShadowTransition
```

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

The transition image.

## Discussion

This method applies the page curl with shadow transition filter to an image. The effect transitions from one image to another by simulating a curling page, revealing the target image as the page curls with a shadow effect from the backside image.

The page curl with shadow transition filter uses the following properties:

- **`inputImage`**: The starting image with the type [CIImage](../ciimage.md).
- **`targetImage`**: The ending image with the type [CIImage](../ciimage.md).
- **`backsideImage`**: An image used as the backside of the curl with the type [CIImage](../ciimage.md).
- **`extent`**: A [CIVector](../civector.md) representing the extent of the effect.
- **`angle`**: A `float` representing the angle of the motion, in radians as an [NSNumber](../../foundation/nsnumber.md).
- **`shadowAmount`**: A `float` representing the strength of the shadow as an [NSNumber](../../foundation/nsnumber.md).
- **`shadowExtent`**: A [CIVector](../civector.md) representing the rectangular portion of the input image that is used to create the shadow.
- **`shadowSize`**: A `float` representing the maximum amount of pixels to make up the shadow as an [NSNumber](../../foundation/nsnumber.md).
- **`time`**: A `float` representing the parametric time of the transition from start (at time 0) to end (at time 1) as an [NSNumber](../../foundation/nsnumber.md).

The following code creates a page curling back to reveal the target image with an added shadow.

```swift
func pageCurl(inputImage: CIImage, targetImage: CIImage, backsideImage: CIImage) -> CIImage {
    let pageCurlTransition = CIFilter.pageCurlWithShadowTransition()
    pageCurlTransition.inputImage = inputImage
    pageCurlTransition.targetImage = targetImage
    pageCurlTransition.backsideImage = backsideImage
    pageCurlTransition.extent = CGRect(x: 54, y: 90, width: 300, height: 300)
    pageCurlTransition.time = 0.5
    pageCurlTransition.angle = 4
    pageCurlTransition.radius = 100
    pageCurlTransition.shadowAmount = 10
    pageCurlTransition.shadowSize = 6
    pageCurlTransition.shadowExtent = CGRect(x: 32, y: 56, width: 400, height: 400)
    return pageCurlTransition.outputImage!
}
```
