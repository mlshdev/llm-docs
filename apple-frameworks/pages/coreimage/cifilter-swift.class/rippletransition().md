# rippleTransition() (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Image  
**Kind:** Type Method  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 13.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

Simulates a ripple in a pond to transiton from one image to another.

## Declaration

```swift
class func rippleTransition() -> any CIFilter & CIRippleTransition
```

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

The transition image.

## Discussion

This method applies the ripple transition filter to an image. The effect transitions from one image to another by creating a circular wave that expands from the center point, revealing the target image through the wave effect.

The ripple transition filter uses the following properties:

- **`inputImage`**: The starting image with the type [CIImage](../ciimage.md).
- **`targetImage`**: The ending image with the type [CIImage](../ciimage.md).
- **`center`**: A set of coordinates marking the center of the image as a [CGPoint](../../corefoundation/cgpoint.md).
- **`width`**: A `float` representing the width of the ripple effect as an [NSNumber](../../foundation/nsnumber.md).
- **`extent`**: A [CGRect](../../corefoundation/cgrect.md) representing the size of the ripple effect.
- **`scale`**: A `float` representing the scale of the effect as an [NSNumber](../../foundation/nsnumber.md).
- **`time`**: A `float` representing the parametric time of the transition from start (at time 0) to end (at time 1) as an [NSNumber](../../foundation/nsnumber.md).

The following code creates a filter that transitions from the input image to the target image with a water-like ripple effect.

```swift
func ripple (inputImage: CIImage, targetImage: CIImage) -> CIImage {
    let rippleTransition = CIFilter.rippleTransition()
    rippleTransition.inputImage = inputImage
    rippleTransition.targetImage = targetImage
    rippleTransition.center = CGPoint(x: 250, y: 150)
    rippleTransition.width = 100
    rippleTransition.extent = CGRect(x: 54, y: 80, width: 300, height: 300)
    rippleTransition.scale = 22
    rippleTransition.time = 0.3
    return rippleTransition.outputImage!
}
```
