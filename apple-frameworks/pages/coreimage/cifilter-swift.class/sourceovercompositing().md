Places one image over a second image.

## Declaration

```swift
class func sourceOverCompositing() -> any CIFilter & CICompositeOperation

## Discussion

This method applies the source-over compositing filter to an image. The effect creates the result by overlaying the input image over the background image. Unlike the other source compositing filters, source-over doesn’t subtract parts of the image.

The source-over compositing filter uses the following properties:

- **`inputImage`**: An image with the type [CIImage](../ciimage.md).
- **`backgroundImage`**: An image with the type [CIImage](../ciimage.md).

The following code creates a filter that results in both of the input images becoming visible with no subtraction:

```swift
func sourceOverCompositing(inputImage: CIImage, backgroundImage: CIImage) -> CIImage {
    let colorBlendFilter = CIFilter.sourceOverCompositing()
    colorBlendFilter.inputImage = inputImage
    colorBlendFilter.backgroundImage = backgroundImage
    return colorBlendFilter.outputImage!
}
```
