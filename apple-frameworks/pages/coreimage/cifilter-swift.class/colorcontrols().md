# colorControls() (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Image  
**Kind:** Type Method  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 13.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

Alters the brightness, contrast, and saturation of an image’s colors.

## Declaration

```swift
class func colorControls() -> any CIFilter & CIColorControls
```

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

The modified image.

## Discussion

This method applies the color controls filter to an image. The effect calculates saturation by linearly interpolating between a grayscale image with a saturation of `0.0` and the original image saturation of `1.0.`

The color controls filter uses the following properties:

- **`brightness`**: A `float` representing the amount of brightness applied as a [NSNumber](../../foundation/nsnumber.md).
- **`contrast`**: A `float` `r`epresenting the amount of contrast applied as a [NSNumber](../../foundation/nsnumber.md).
- **`saturation`**: A float representing the amount of saturation applied as a [NSNumber](../../foundation/nsnumber.md).
- **`inputImage`**: An image with the type [CIImage](../ciimage.md).

The following code creates a filter that results in a darker image:

```swift
func colorControls(inputImage: CIImage) -> CIImage {
    let colorControlsFilter = CIFilter.colorControls()
    colorControlsFilter.inputImage = inputImage
    colorControlsFilter.brightness = -0.4
    colorControlsFilter.contrast = 1
    colorControlsFilter.saturation = 1
    return colorControlsFilter.outputImage!
}
```
