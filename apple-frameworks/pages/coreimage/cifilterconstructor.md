# CIFilterConstructor (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Image  
**Kind:** Protocol  
**Availability:** iOS · iPadOS · Mac Catalyst · macOS · tvOS · visionOS

A general interface for objects that produce filters.

## Declaration

```swift
protocol CIFilterConstructor
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Objects implementing this protocol are called *filter constructors*—they produce new instances of [CIFilter](cifilter-swift.class.md) subclasses when filters are requested by name. You can create a filter constructor to provide new, custom filters that other Core Image clients can discover using the `CIFilter` class. Normally, you create and register custom filters by packaging them as Image Units (see [Packaging and Loading Image Units](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/GraphicsImaging/Conceptual/CoreImaging/ci_image_units/ci_image_units.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001185-CH7)), but you can use this protocol to provide new filters within your app that are compositions of existing filters.

To provide custom filters using this protocol, you must:

1. Create your custom filters as `CIFilter` subclasses.
2. Create a class that implements this protocol to vend instances of the appropriate `CIFilter` subclasses when requested.
3. Call the `CIFilter` class method [registerName(\_:constructor:classAttributes:)](cifilter-swift.class/registername%28__constructor_classattributes_%29.md) for each custom filter, providing the filter’s name, an instance of your filter constructor class, and information about the filter’s attributes.

## Topics

### Providing Filter Objects

- [filter(withName:)](cifilterconstructor/filter%28withname_%29.md): Returns a filter object specified by name.

## Relationships

### Conforming Types

- [CIFilterGenerator](cifiltergenerator.md)

### Image Units

- [CIPlugIn](ciplugin.md): The mechanism for loading image units in macOS.
- [CIFilterGenerator](cifiltergenerator.md): An object that creates and configures chains of individual image filters.
- [CIPlugInRegistration](cipluginregistration.md): The interface for loading Core Image image units.
