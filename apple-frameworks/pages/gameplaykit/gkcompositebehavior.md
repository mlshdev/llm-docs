# GKCompositeBehavior (Swift)

**Framework:** GameplayKit  
**Kind:** Class  
**Availability:** iOS 9.0+ · iPadOS 9.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.11+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

A set of behaviors, each of which is a set of goals, that together influence the movement of an agent.

## Declaration

```swift
class GKCompositeBehavior
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

By composing [GKGoal](gkgoal.md) objects into subgroups ([GKBehavior](gkbehavior.md) objects) and composing those behaviors into composite behaviors, you can control certain aspects of a [GKAgent](gkagent.md) object’s movement in concert. To assign a behavior to an agent, use its [behavior](gkagent/behavior.md) property.

For example, you might create a behavior for a set of agents to stay together as a flock (with cohesion, alignment, and separation goals) while loosely following a path. With a single [GKBehavior](gkbehavior.md) object, whenever you want to change the importance of the flocking goals relative to the path-following goals, you’d need to individually change the weight of each goal. With a composite behavior, you can adjust the relative influence of a group of goals together, as in the following code.

**Swift**

```swift
let flock = GKBehavior(goals: [
    GKGoal(toAlignWith: agents, maxDistance: 10, maxAngle: .pi/4),
    GKGoal(toCohereWith: agents, maxDistance: 10, maxAngle: .pi/4),
    GKGoal(toSeparateFrom: agents, maxDistance: 10, maxAngle: .pi/4),
])
let meanderOnPath = GKBehavior(goals: [
    GKGoal(toFollow: path, maxPredictionTime: 1, forward: true),
    GKGoal(toWander: 10)
])
let composite = GKCompositeBehavior(behaviors: [
    flock, meanderOnPath
])
```

**Objective-C**

```objc
GKBehavior *flock = [GKBehavior behaviorWithGoals:@[
    [GKGoal goalToAlignWithAgents:agents maxDistance:10 maxAngle:M_PI_4],
    [GKGoal goalToCohereWithAgents:agents maxDistance:10 maxAngle:M_PI_4],
    [GKGoal goalToSeparateFromAgents:agents maxDistance:10 maxAngle:M_PI_4]
]];
GKBehavior *meanderOnPath = [GKBehavior behaviorWithgoals:@[
    [GKGoal goalToFollowPath:path maxPredictionTime:1.0 forward:YES],
    [GKGoal goalToWander:10]
]];
GKCompositeBehavior *composite = [GKCompositeBehavior behaviorWithBehaviors:@[
    flock, meanderOnPath
]];
```

After constructing this behavior, you can use the [setWeight(\_:for:)](gkcompositebehavior/setweight%28__for_%29.md) method to increase or decrease the influence of the `flock` and `meanderOnPath` behaviors relative to one another.

## Topics

### Creating a Composite Behavior

- [init(behaviors:)](gkcompositebehavior/init%28behaviors_%29.md): Creates a composite behavior from the specified individual behaviors.
- [init(behaviors:andWeights:)](gkcompositebehavior/init%28behaviors_andweights_%29.md): Creates a behavior with the specified behaviors and weights.

### Managing the Individual Behaviors in a Composite Behavior

- [setWeight(\_:for:)](gkcompositebehavior/setweight%28__for_%29.md): Sets the weight for the specified individual behavior’s influence on agents, adding that behavior to the composite behavior if it is not already present.
- [weight(for:)](gkcompositebehavior/weight%28for_%29.md): Returns the weight for the specified individual behavior’s influence on agents.
- [remove(\_:)](gkcompositebehavior/remove%28__%29.md): Removes the specified individual behavior from the composite behavior.
- [removeAllBehaviors()](gkcompositebehavior/removeallbehaviors%28%29.md): Removes all individual behaviors from the composite behavior.
- [behaviorCount](gkcompositebehavior/behaviorcount.md): The number of individual behaviors in the composite behavior.

### Working with Behaviors Using Subscript Syntax

- [subscript(\_:)](gkcompositebehavior/subscript%28__%29-6jng9.md): Returns the weight associated with the behavior specified by subscript syntax.
- [subscript(\_:)](gkcompositebehavior/subscript%28__%29-6krdg.md): Returns the individual behavior at the specified index in the composite behavior’s list of behaviors.
