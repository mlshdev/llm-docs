# pathWithGraphNodes:radius:

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** GameplayKit  
**Kind:** Type Method  
**Availability:** iOS 9.0+ · iPadOS 9.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.11+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

Creates a path using the positions of the specified graph nodes.

## Declaration

```objectivec
+ (instancetype) pathWithGraphNodes:(NSArray<GKGraphNode *> *) graphNodes radius:(float) radius;
```

## Parameters

- `graphNodes`: An array of graph node objects containing 2D or 3D points.
- `radius`: The radius of the path.

## Discussion

Use this method to turn a list of nodes from a navigation graph (as returned by the [GKGraph](../gkgraph.md) [findPathFromNode:toNode:](../gkgraph/findpath%28from_to_%29.md) method) into a path-following goal for an agent. If the nodes are [GKGraphNode2D](../gkgraphnode2d.md) objects, this method creates a 2D path; if the nodes are [GKGraphNode3D](../gkgraphnode3d.md) objects, this method creates a 3D path.

The `radius` parameter defines the space occupied by the path—think of this space as the area created by sweeping a circle (or sphere, for 3D paths) of the specified radius along the path from vertex to vertex. Agents with path-related goals will attempt to move to or stay within this area.

To use the newly created path to constrain an agent’s behavior, create a goal with the [goalToStayOnPath:maxPredictionTime:](../gkgoal/init%28tostayon_maxpredictiontime_%29.md) or [goalToFollowPath:maxPredictionTime:forward:](../gkgoal/init%28tofollow_maxpredictiontime_forward_%29.md) method.
