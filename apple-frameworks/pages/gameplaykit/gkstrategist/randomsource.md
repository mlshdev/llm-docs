# randomSource (Swift)

**Framework:** GameplayKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 9.0+ · iPadOS 9.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.11+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

A randomizer object to be used when the strategist randomly selects a move.

## Declaration

```swift
var randomSource: (any GKRandom)? { get set }
```

## Discussion

A strategist class uses this random source when you call the [bestMoveForActivePlayer()](bestmoveforactiveplayer%28%29.md) method. Different strategist classes use randomization in different ways:

- A *deterministic* strategy, such as that of the [GKMinmaxStrategist](../gkminmaxstrategist.md) class, can reach states where multiple moves are rated the most desirable. In such cases, the strategist can randomly choose from among the best possible moves, making the behavior of a computer-controlled player appear more natural and unpredictable.

If this property is set to `nil` (the default), the [GKMinmaxStrategist](../gkminmaxstrategist.md) class method does not randomize—that is, when repeatedly presented with the same set of equally-optimal moves, the [bestMoveForActivePlayer()](bestmoveforactiveplayer%28%29.md) method always makes the same choice.

- A *probabilistic* strategy, such as that of the [GKMonteCarloStrategist](../gkmontecarlostrategist.md) class, *requires* a random source in order to randomly explore the set of possible moves.

If this property is set to `nil` (the default), the [GKMonteCarloStrategist](../gkmontecarlostrategist.md) class throws an exception when you call the [bestMoveForActivePlayer()](bestmoveforactiveplayer%28%29.md) method.

A randomizer is any object that implements the [GKRandom](../gkrandom.md) protocol, such as the [GKRandomSource](../gkrandomsource.md) and [GKRandomDistribution](../gkrandomdistribution.md) classes and their subclasses. Choosing a separate randomizer instance from that used by other systems in your game ensures that the randomization of moves is independent; that is, the strategist’s selection of moves does not depend on your game’s other uses of randomization APIs. You can also use randomizer classes to reproduce a specific sequence of random actions for debugging, and to fine-tune the randomization behavior.
