# init(randomSource:lowestValue:highestValue:) (Swift)

**Framework:** GameplayKit  
**Kind:** Initializer  
**Availability:** iOS 9.0+ · iPadOS 9.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.11+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

Initializes a Gaussian random distribution with the specified lower and upper bounds, using the specified source randomizer.

## Declaration

```swift
init(randomSource source: any GKRandom, lowestValue lowestInclusive: Int, highestValue highestInclusive: Int)
```

## Parameters

- `source`: A randomizer that produces raw random values for use by the distribution. A randomizer is any object implementing the [GKRandom](../gkrandom.md) protocol, which can be a random source algorithm such as the [GKARC4RandomSource](../gkarc4randomsource.md) class or another random distribution.
- `lowestInclusive`: The lowest value to be produced by the distribution.
- `highestInclusive`: The highest value to be produced by the distribution.

## Return Value

A new random distribution.

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

Using this initializer creates a Gaussian distribution centered within the specified range. The [mean](mean.md) property is set to the midpoint between the `lowestInclusive` and `highestInclusive` parameters (`mean = (highest + lowest) / 2`), and the [deviation](deviation.md) property is set such that the highest and lowest values are each three deviations away from the mean (`deviation = (highest - lowest) / 6`). The [mean](mean.md) and [deviation](deviation.md) properties can thus be floating-point values even if you use the distribution only to produce integers.

A random distribution works by mapping the values produced by the `source` randomizer to the range and characteristics specified by the distribution. Multiple distributions can share the same source, with the side effect that retrieving a random value through one distribution affects the sequence of random numbers produced by the source.
