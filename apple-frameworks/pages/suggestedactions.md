## Overview

When people send each other messages in your messaging app, they share information like dates, reminders, or other actionable content. To let people complete a message-related task in your messaging app with Suggested Actions, add a [SuggestedActionsView](suggestedactions/suggestedactionsview.md) below a message and provide the view with message content. To preserve user privacy, the framework analyzes the message content you provide on-device and doesn’t send it to Apple servers.

By default, the `SuggestedActionsView` doesn’t take up space or affect your layout. When you provide it with message content, Suggested Actions identifies the suggested actions that apply to the message, then shows the [SuggestedActionsView](suggestedactions/suggestedactionsview.md) inline, filled with actions a person can take. For example, Suggested Actions can detect and suggest actions such as:

- Creating an event in Calendar from a proposed meeting time
- Adding an entry in Reminders
- Opening a location in Maps

> **Note**

> To use the Suggested Actions framework, add the [Suggested Actions](bundleresources/entitlements/com.apple.developer.suggested-actions.md) entitlement to your app target.
