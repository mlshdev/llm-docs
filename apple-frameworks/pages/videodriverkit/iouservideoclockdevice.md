## Overview

[IOUserVideoClockDevice](iouservideoclockdevice.md) handles the necessary configurations to be able to run IO.

## Topics

### Creating a clock device

- [Create](iouservideoclockdevice/create.md): A static factory method that allocates and initializes a video clock device.
- [init](iouservideoclockdevice/init.md): Initializes a video clock device.
- [IOUserVideoDriver](iouservideodriver.md): A video driver.

### Freeing a clock device

- [free](iouservideoclockdevice/free.md): Frees the video clock device.

### Getting information about the class

- [GetClassID](iouservideoclockdevice/getclassid.md): Gets the class identifier of the object.
- [GetBaseClassID](iouservideoclockdevice/getbaseclassid.md): Gets the class identifier of the base class object.
- [IOUserVideoClassID](videodriverkit/iouservideoclassid.md): Video class identifiers of an video object.

### Performing I/O

- [StartIO](iouservideoclockdevice/startio.md): Tells the clock device to start IO.
- [StopIO](iouservideoclockdevice/stopio.md): Tells the clock device to stop IO.
- [IOUserVideoStartStopFlags](videodriverkit/iouservideostartstopflags.md): Flags used to indicate how I/O is starting or stopping.

### Supporting device configuration changes

- [PerformDeviceConfigurationChange](iouservideoclockdevice/performdeviceconfigurationchange.md): The host calls this method to allow the clock device to perform a configuration change that had been previously requested via a call to the host via RequestDeviceConfigChange or a change to an IO state that requires a configuration change
- [AbortDeviceConfigurationChange](iouservideoclockdevice/abortdeviceconfigurationchange.md): The host calls this method to tell the driver not to perform a configuration change that had been requested via a call to the Host method, RequestDeviceConfigurationChange().

### Supporting sample rate changes
