## Discussion

A uint32_t whose value indicates the clock domain to which the IOUserVideoClockDevice belongs. IOUserVideoClockDevices that have the same value for this property can synchronize in hardware. However, a value of 0 indicates that the clock domain for the device is unspecified; treat it as separate from every other device’s clock domain, even if they have the value of 0 as their clock domain as well.

Drivers can change the clock domain of the clock device dynamically. If successful, the clock device sends a notification to the host to update the object state.
