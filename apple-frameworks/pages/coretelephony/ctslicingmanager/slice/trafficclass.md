## Discussion

The traffic class indicates the quality of service characteristics for the slice, such as voice, video, or background data. When the network slice doesn’t have a specific traffic class restriction, this property returns [CTSlicingManager.TrafficClass.any](../trafficclass/any.md), indicating the slice can handle all types of network traffic.
