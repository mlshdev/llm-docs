# Insecure.SHA1

**Framework:** Apple CryptoKit

An implementation of SHA1 hashing.

## Declaration

```swift
struct SHA1
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

The [Insecure.SHA1](sha1.md) hash implements the [HashFunction](../hashfunction.md) protocol to produce a SHA1 digest ([Insecure.SHA1Digest](sha1digest.md)).

You can compute the digest by calling the static `hash(data:)` method once. Alternatively, if the data that you want to hash is too large to fit in memory, you can compute the digest iteratively by creating a new hash instance, calling the `update(data:)` method repeatedly with blocks of data, and then calling the [finalize()](sha1/finalize%28%29.md) method to get the result.

> **Important**

> This hash algorithm isn’t considered cryptographically secure, but is provided for backward compatibility with older services that require it. For new services, prefer one of the secure hashes, like [SHA512](../sha512.md).

## Topics

### Specifying the output type

- [Insecure.SHA1.Digest](sha1/digest.md): The digest type for a SHA1 hash function.
- [Insecure.SHA1Digest](sha1digest.md): The output of a SHA1 hash.

### Reporting the hash length

- [byteCount](sha1/bytecount.md): The number of bytes in a SHA1 digest.

### Computing a hash iteratively

- [init()](sha1/init%28%29.md): Creates a SHA1 hash function.
- [update(bufferPointer:)](sha1/update%28bufferpointer_%29.md): Incrementally updates the hash function with the contents of the buffer.
- [finalize()](sha1/finalize%28%29.md): Finalizes the hash function and returns the computed digest.

### Reporting hash function information

- [blockByteCount](sha1/blockbytecount.md): The number of bytes that represents the hash function’s internal state.
