# SharedSecret

**Framework:** Apple CryptoKit  
**Kind:** Structure  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 13.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 6.0+

A key agreement result from which you can derive a symmetric cryptographic key.

## Declaration

```swift
struct SharedSecret
```

## Overview

Generate a shared secret by calling your private key’s `sharedSecretFromKeyAgreement(publicKeyShare:)` method with the public key from another party. The other party computes the same secret by passing your public key to the the equivalent method on their own private key.

The shared secret isn’t suitable as a symmetric cryptographic key ([SymmetricKey](symmetrickey.md)) by itself. However, you use it to generate a key by calling either the [hkdfDerivedSymmetricKey(using:salt:sharedInfo:outputByteCount:)](sharedsecret/hkdfderivedsymmetrickey%28using_salt_sharedinfo_outputbytecount_%29.md) or [x963DerivedSymmetricKey(using:sharedInfo:outputByteCount:)](sharedsecret/x963derivedsymmetrickey%28using_sharedinfo_outputbytecount_%29.md) method of the shared secret. After the other party does the same, then you both share a symmetric key suitable for creating a message authentication code like [HMAC](hmac.md), or for opening and closing a sealed box with a cipher like [ChaChaPoly](chachapoly.md) or [AES](aes.md).

## Topics

### Deriving keys

- [hkdfDerivedSymmetricKey(using:salt:sharedInfo:outputByteCount:)](sharedsecret/hkdfderivedsymmetrickey%28using_salt_sharedinfo_outputbytecount_%29.md): Derives a symmetric encryption key from the secret using HKDF key derivation.
- [x963DerivedSymmetricKey(using:sharedInfo:outputByteCount:)](sharedsecret/x963derivedsymmetrickey%28using_sharedinfo_outputbytecount_%29.md): Derives a symmetric encryption key from the secret using x9.63 key derivation.

### Comparing shared secrets

- [==(\_:\_:)](sharedsecret/==%28____%29.md): Determines whether a shared secret is equivalent to a collection of contiguous bytes.
