## Discussion

Values can be from `1` to `53` and from `-1` to `-53`. This property value is valid only for recurrence rules initialized with specific weeks of the year and a frequency type of [EKRecurrenceFrequency.yearly](../ekrecurrencefrequency/yearly.md).

Negative values indicate counting backwards from the end of the year.
