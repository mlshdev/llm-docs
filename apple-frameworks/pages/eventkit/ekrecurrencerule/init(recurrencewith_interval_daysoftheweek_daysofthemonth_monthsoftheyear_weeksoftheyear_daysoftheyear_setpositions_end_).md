# init(recurrenceWith:interval:daysOfTheWeek:daysOfTheMonth:monthsOfTheYear:weeksOfTheYear:daysOfTheYear:setPositions:end:) (Swift)

**Framework:** EventKit  
**Kind:** Initializer  
**Availability:** iOS 4.0+ · iPadOS 4.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.8+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

Initializes and returns a recurrence rule with a given frequency and additional scheduling information.

## Declaration

```swift
init(recurrenceWith type: EKRecurrenceFrequency, interval: Int, daysOfTheWeek days: [EKRecurrenceDayOfWeek]?, daysOfTheMonth monthDays: [NSNumber]?, monthsOfTheYear months: [NSNumber]?, weeksOfTheYear: [NSNumber]?, daysOfTheYear: [NSNumber]?, setPositions: [NSNumber]?, end: EKRecurrenceEnd?)
```

## Parameters

- `type`: The frequency of the recurrence rule. Can be daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly.
- `interval`: The interval between instances of this recurrence. For example, a weekly recurrence rule with an interval of `2` occurs every other week. Must be greater than `0`.
- `days`: The days of the week that the event occurs, as an array of [EKRecurrenceDayOfWeek](../ekrecurrencedayofweek.md) objects.
- `monthDays`: The days of the month that the event occurs, as an array of [NSNumber](../../foundation/nsnumber.md) objects. Values can be from `1` to `31` and from `-1` to `-31`. This parameter is only valid for recurrence rules of type [EKRecurrenceFrequency.monthly](../ekrecurrencefrequency/monthly.md).
- `months`: The months of the year that the event occurs, as an array of `NSNumber` objects. Values can be from `1` to `12`. This parameter is only valid for recurrence rules of type [EKRecurrenceFrequency.yearly](../ekrecurrencefrequency/yearly.md).
- `weeksOfTheYear`: The weeks of the year that the event occurs, as an array of `NSNumber` objects. Values can be from `1` to `53` and from `-1` to `-53`. This parameter is only valid for recurrence rules of type [EKRecurrenceFrequency.yearly](../ekrecurrencefrequency/yearly.md).
- `daysOfTheYear`: The days of the year that the event occurs, as an array of `NSNumber` objects. Values can be from `1` to `366` and from `-1` to `-366`. This parameter is only valid for recurrence rules of type [EKRecurrenceFrequency.yearly](../ekrecurrencefrequency/yearly.md).
- `setPositions`: An array of ordinal numbers that filters which recurrences to include in the recurrence rule’s frequency. See [setPositions](setpositions.md) for more information.
- `end`: The end of the recurrence rule.

Negative values indicate counting backwards from the end of the recurrence rule’s frequency.

# initRecurrenceWithFrequency:interval:daysOfTheWeek:daysOfTheMonth:monthsOfTheYear:weeksOfTheYear:daysOfTheYear:setPositions:end: (Objective-C)

**Framework:** EventKit  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 4.0+ · iPadOS 4.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.8+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

Initializes and returns a recurrence rule with a given frequency and additional scheduling information.

## Declaration

```objectivec

```

## Parameters

- `type`: The frequency of the recurrence rule. Can be daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly.
- `interval`: The interval between instances of this recurrence. For example, a weekly recurrence rule with an interval of `2` occurs every other week. Must be greater than `0`.

- `monthDays`: The days of the month that the event occurs, as an array of [NSNumber](../../foundation/nsnumber.md) objects. Values can be from `1` to `31` and from `-1` to `-31`. This parameter is only valid for recurrence rules of type [EKRecurrenceFrequencyMonthly](../ekrecurrencefrequency/monthly.md).
- `months`: The months of the year that the event occurs, as an array of `NSNumber` objects. Values can be from `1` to `12`. This parameter is only valid for recurrence rules of type [EKRecurrenceFrequencyYearly](../ekrecurrencefrequency/yearly.md).
- `weeksOfTheYear`: The weeks of the year that the event occurs, as an array of `NSNumber` objects. Values can be from `1` to `53` and from `-1` to `-53`. This parameter is only valid for recurrence rules of type [EKRecurrenceFrequencyYearly](../ekrecurrencefrequency/yearly.md).
