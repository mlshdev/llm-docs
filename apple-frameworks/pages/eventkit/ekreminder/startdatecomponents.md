# startDateComponents (Swift)

**Framework:** EventKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 6.0+ · iPadOS 6.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.8+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

The start date of the task.

## Declaration

```

## Discussion

The use of date components allows the start date and its time zone to be represented in a single property. A `nil` time zone represents a floating date. Setting a date component without an hour, minute and second component will set the reminder to be an all-day reminder. If this property is set, the calendar must be set to `NSGregorianCalendar`; otherwise an exception is raised.

The start date components’s `timeZone` property corresponds to the [timeZone](../ekcalendaritem/timezone.md) property on `EKCalendarItem`. A change in one value will cause a change in the other. Setting the time zone directly on the components does not guarantee that your changes will be saved; instead, pull this property from the reminder, set the time zone on it, and assign it back to the reminder:

```objc
NSDateComponents *start = myEKReminder.startDateComponents;
start.timeZone = myNSTimeZone;
myEKReminder.startDateComponents = start;
```
