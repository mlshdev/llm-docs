# Creating a recurring event (Swift)

**Framework:** EventKit  
**Kind:** Article

Set up an event or reminder that repeats.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Recurring events repeat over a specified interval of time. To make an event recurring, assign it a recurrence rule that describes when the event occurs. Recurrence rules are represented by instances of the [EKRecurrenceRule](ekrecurrencerule.md) class.

Recurrence is applicable to both calendar events and reminders. Unlike with recurring events, only the first incomplete reminder of a recurring set is obtainable. This is true with EventKit as well as the Reminders app. When the reminder is completed, the next reminder in the recurrence set becomes available.

### Create a Basic Rule

You can create a recurrence rule with a simple daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly pattern using the [init(recurrenceWith:interval:end:)](ekrecurrencerule/init%28recurrencewith_interval_end_%29.md) method. You provide three values to this method:

- **The recurrence frequency.** This is a value of type [EKRecurrenceFrequency](ekrecurrencefrequency.md) that indicates whether the recurrence rule is daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly.
- **The recurrence interval.** This is an integer greater than `0` that specifies how often a pattern repeats. For example, if the recurrence rule is a weekly recurrence rule and its interval is `1`, then the pattern repeats every week. If the recurrence rule is a monthly recurrence rule and its interval is `3`, then the pattern repeats every three months.
- **The recurrence end.** This optional parameter is an instance of the [EKRecurrenceEnd](ekrecurrenceend.md) class, which indicates when the recurrence rule ends. The recurrence end can be based on a specific end date or on an amount of occurrences. If you don’t want to specify an end for the recurrence rule, pass `nil`.

### Create a Complex Rule

You can create a recurrence rule with a complex pattern using the [init(recurrenceWith:interval:daysOfTheWeek:daysOfTheMonth:monthsOfTheYear:weeksOfTheYear:daysOfTheYear:setPositions:end:)](ekrecurrencerule/init%28recurrencewith_interval_daysoftheweek_daysofthemonth_monthsoftheyear_weeksoftheyear_daysoftheyear_setpositions_end_%29.md) method. As for a basic recurrence rule, you provide a frequency, interval, and optional end for the recurring event. In addition, you can provide a combination of optional values describing a custom rule, as listed in the table below.

| Parameter name | Accepted values | Can be combined with | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `days` | An array of [EKRecurrenceDayOfWeek](ekrecurrencedayofweek.md) objects. | All recurrence rules except for daily recurrence rules. | An array containing [EKTuesday](ekweekday/ektuesday.md) and [EKFriday](ekweekday/ekfriday.md) objects will create a recurrence that occurs every Tuesday and Friday. |
| `monthDays` | An array of nonzero [NSNumber](../foundation/nsnumber.md) objects ranging from `–31` to `31`. Negative values indicate counting backward from the end of the month. | Monthly recurrence rules only. | An array containing the values `1` and `–1` will create a recurrence that occurs on the first and last day of every month. |
| `months` | An array of [NSNumber](../foundation/nsnumber.md) objects with values ranging from 1 to 12, corresponding to Gregorian calendar months. | Yearly recurrence rules only. | If your originating event occurs on January 10, you can provide an array containing the values `1` and `2` to create a recurrence that occurs every January 10 and February 10. |
| `weeksOfTheYear` | An array of nonzero [NSNumber](../foundation/nsnumber.md) objects ranging from `–53` to `53`. Negative values indicate counting backward from the end of the year. | Yearly recurrence rules only. | If your originating event occurs on a Wednesday, you can provide an array containing the values `1` and `–1` to create a recurrence that occurs on the Wednesday of the first and last weeks of every year. If a specified week does not contain a Wednesday in the current year, as can be the case for the first or last week of a year, the event does not occur. |
| `daysOfTheYear` | An array of nonzero [NSNumber](../foundation/nsnumber.md) objects ranging from `–366` to `366`. Negative values indicate counting backward from the end of the year. | Yearly recurrence rules only. | You can provide an array containing the values `1` and `–1` to create a recurrence that occurs on the first and last day of every year. |
| `setPositions` | An array of nonzero [NSNumber](../foundation/nsnumber.md) objects ranging from `–366` to `366`. Negative values indicate counting backward from the end of the list of occurrences. | All recurrence rules except for daily recurrence rules. | If you provide an array containing the values `1` and `–1` to a yearly recurrence rule that has specified Monday through Friday as its value for days of the week, the recurrence occurs only on the first and last weekday of every year. |

You can provide values for any number of the parameters in the table. Parameters that don’t apply to a particular recurrence rule are ignored. If you provide a value for more than one of the parameters, the recurrence occurs only on days that apply to all provided values.

Once you have created a recurrence rule, you can apply it to a calendar event or reminder with the [addRecurrenceRule(\_:)](ekcalendaritem/addrecurrencerule%28__%29.md) method of [EKCalendarItem](ekcalendaritem.md).

### Create a Complex Rule

You can create a recurrence rule with a complex pattern using the [initRecurrenceWithFrequency:interval:daysOfTheWeek:daysOfTheMonth:monthsOfTheYear:weeksOfTheYear:daysOfTheYear:setPositions:end:](ekrecurrencerule/init%28recurrencewith_interval_daysoftheweek_daysofthemonth_monthsoftheyear_weeksoftheyear_daysoftheyear_setpositions_end_%29.md) method. As for a basic recurrence rule, you provide a frequency, interval, and optional end for the recurring event. In addition, you can provide a combination of optional values describing a custom rule, as listed in the table below.

| Parameter name | Accepted values | Can be combined with | Example |

Negative values indicate counting backward from the end of the year. | Yearly recurrence rules only. | If your originating event occurs on a Wednesday, you can provide an array containing the values `1` and `–1` to create a recurrence that occurs on the Wednesday of the first and last weeks of every year. If a specified week does not contain a Wednesday in the current year, as can be the case for the first or last week of a year, the event does not occur. |

You can provide values for any number of the parameters in the table. Parameters that don’t apply to a particular recurrence rule are ignored. If you provide a value for more than one of the parameters, the recurrence occurs only on days that apply to all provided values.

Once you have created a recurrence rule, you can apply it to a calendar event or reminder with the [addRecurrenceRule:](ekcalendaritem/addrecurrencerule%28__%29.md) method of [EKCalendarItem](ekcalendaritem.md).
