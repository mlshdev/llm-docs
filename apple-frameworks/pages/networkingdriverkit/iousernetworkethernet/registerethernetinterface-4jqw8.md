# RegisterEthernetInterface

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** NetworkingDriverKit  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** DriverKit

Registers your driver with the networking stack.

## Declaration

```objectivec
virtual kern_return_t RegisterEthernetInterface(IOUserNetworkMACAddress macAddress, IOUserNetworkPacketBufferPool *pool, IOUserNetworkPacketQueue **queues, uint32_t queueCount);
```

## Parameters

- `macAddress`: The MAC address of the hardware your driver supports.
- `pool`: The buffer pool you use to store incoming and outgoing packets.
- `queues`: An array containing the four queues you use to process incoming and outgoing network packets. This array must contain one queue each of types [IOUserNetworkRxSubmissionQueue](../iousernetworkrxsubmissionqueue.md), [IOUserNetworkRxCompletionQueue](../iousernetworkrxcompletionqueue.md), [IOUserNetworkTxSubmissionQueue](../iousernetworktxsubmissionqueue.md), and [IOUserNetworkTxCompletionQueue](../iousernetworktxcompletionqueue.md). The order of the queues in the array doesn’t matter.
- `queueCount`: The number of queues in the `queues` parameter. The `queues` parameter must contain 4 items.

## Discussion

Call this method toward the end of your [Start](../../driverkit/ioservice/start.md) method when your driver is ready to begin processing incoming and outgoing network packets.
