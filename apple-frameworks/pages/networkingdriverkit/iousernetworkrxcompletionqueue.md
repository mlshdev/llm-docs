# IOUserNetworkRxCompletionQueue

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** NetworkingDriverKit  
**Kind:** Class  
**Availability:** DriverKit

The queue you use to store packets that you successfully transferred to the networking stack.

## Declaration

```objectivec
class IOUserNetworkRxCompletionQueue;
```

## Overview

Create an [IOUserNetworkRxCompletionQueue](iousernetworkrxcompletionqueue.md) object and use it to deliver packets from your hardware device to the networking stack. As data arrives from your hardware, place the data into empty packets that you dequeued from an [IOUserNetworkRxSubmissionQueue](iousernetworkrxsubmissionqueue.md) object. Deliver the resulting packets to the system by enqueueing them on your [IOUserNetworkRxCompletionQueue](iousernetworkrxcompletionqueue.md) object. After you enqueue the packets, the system transfers the packet data to the networking stack, recycles the packets, and places the packets back in your submission queue.

## Topics
