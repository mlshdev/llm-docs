# IOUserNetworkPacketBufferPool

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** NetworkingDriverKit  
**Kind:** Class  
**Availability:** DriverKit

An object that manages the storage space for packets coming into and out of your driver.

## Declaration

```objectivec
class IOUserNetworkPacketBufferPool;
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Create an [IOUserNetworkPacketBufferPool](iousernetworkpacketbufferpool.md) during the initial setup of your driver and use it to store the packets that your driver transmits or receives. Every driver must have a packet buffer pool large enough to hold all of the packets in its transmit and receive queues. You allocate this pool early in the [Start](../driverkit/ioservice/start.md) method of your [IOUserNetworkEthernet](iousernetworkethernet.md) service, and you deallocate that pool only after your service stops.

## Topics

### Creating a Buffer Pool

- [Create](iousernetworkpacketbufferpool/create.md): Deprecated. Creates a new packet buffer pool object and allocates space for the specified number of packets.
- [init](iousernetworkpacketbufferpool/init.md): Initializes the network packet buffer pool object.
- [free](iousernetworkpacketbufferpool/free.md): Releases the resources owned by the network packet buffer pool object.

### Getting Pool Information

- [GetBufferCount](iousernetworkpacketbufferpool/getbuffercount.md): Returns the number of buffers associated with the network packet buffer pool.
- [GetPacketCount](iousernetworkpacketbufferpool/getpacketcount.md): Returns the number of network packets that the pool is capable of storing.

### Deallocating Packets

- [DeallocatePacket](iousernetworkpacketbufferpool/deallocatepacket-3i02n.md): Deprecated. Disposes of any resources associated with the packet and makes the packet available for reuse.
- [DeallocatePackets](iousernetworkpacketbufferpool/deallocatepackets-186ya.md): Deprecated. Disposes of any resources associated with the specified packets and makes them available for reuse.

### Getting the Memory Block

- [CopyMemoryDescriptor](iousernetworkpacketbufferpool/copymemorydescriptor.md): Returns a memory descriptor for the buffer pool’s contents.
