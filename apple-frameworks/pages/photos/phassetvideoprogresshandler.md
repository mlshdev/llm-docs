# PHAssetVideoProgressHandler (Swift)

**Framework:** Photos  
**Kind:** Type Alias  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ · iPadOS 8.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 10.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

The signature for a block that Photos calls while downloading asset data from iCloud. Used by the [progressHandler](phvideorequestoptions/progresshandler.md) property.

## Declaration

```swift
typealias PHAssetVideoProgressHandler = (Double, (any Error)?, UnsafeMutablePointer<ObjCBool>, [AnyHashable : Any]?) -> Void
```

## Discussion

If you request a video asset whose data is not on the local device, and you have enabled downloading with the [isNetworkAccessAllowed](phvideorequestoptions/isnetworkaccessallowed.md) property, Photos calls your block periodically to report progress and allow canceling the download.

> **Note**

>  Because Photos calls this block in an arbitrary serial queue, it may not execute on the main thread.

The block takes the following parameters:

- **progress**: A floating-point value indicating the progress of the download. A value of `0.0` indicates the download has just started, and a value of `1.0` indicates the download is complete.
- **error**: An `NSError` object describing an error that occurred when attempting to download the video, or `nil` if no errors have occurred.
- **stop**: A pointer to a Boolean value. To cancel the download, set `*stop` to `true` inside the block.
- **info**: A dictionary providing additional information about the status of the video request. See Image Result Info Keys for possible keys and values.
