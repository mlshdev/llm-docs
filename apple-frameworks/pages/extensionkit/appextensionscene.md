## Overview

When your app extension provides custom UI, use this type to define a specific scene for that UI. An app extension can define multiple scene types in coordination with the host app. When the host app displays the app extension’s UI, it provides a unique string identifier for the scene it wants to display. The app extension responds by providing an instance of this type that contains that scene’s contents.

When defining a scene, provide the body of that scene using the [PrimitiveAppExtensionScene](primitiveappextensionscene.md) type. This type contains the unique identifier of the scene and the content to display. The following code shows an implementation of a scene capable of displaying content you supply at initialization time using a closure. The scene’s [body](appextensionscene/body-swift.property.md) property repackages that content inside the [PrimitiveAppExtensionScene](primitiveappextensionscene.md) structure. You can also use this type to accept a scene-specific XPC connection, which you might use to communicate custom data related to managing UI-related interactions.

```
struct MyScene<Content: View>: AppExtensionScene {

    public init(content: @escaping () ->  Content) {
        self.content = content
    }

    private let content: () -> Content

    public var body: some AppExtensionScene {
        PrimitiveAppExtensionScene(id: “MyScene”) {
            content()
        } onConnection: { connection in
            // TODO: Configure the XPC connection and return true
            return false
        }
    }
}
```
