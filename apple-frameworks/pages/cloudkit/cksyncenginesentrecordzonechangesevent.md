## Overview

If a record save succeeded, you should encode the system fields of this record to use the next time you save. See [encodeSystemFieldsWithCoder:](ckrecord/encodesystemfields%28with_%29.md).

If a record deletion succeeded, you should remove any local system fields for that record.

If the record change failed, try to resolve the issue causing the error and save the record again if necessary.

## Topics
