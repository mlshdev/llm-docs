## Discussion

This property is a closure that returns no value and has the following parameter:

- A [Result](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/result) that contains either:

  - A successful `Result`, or
  - An error that contains information about a problem encountered retrieving the records.

The fetch operation executes this closure only once. The closure executes after all of the individual progress closures, but before the operation’s completion closure. The closure executes serially with respect to the other progress closures of the operation.

If you intend to use this closure to process results, set it before you execute the operation or submit the operation to a queue.
