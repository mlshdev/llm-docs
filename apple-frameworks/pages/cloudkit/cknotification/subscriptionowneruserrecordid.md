# subscriptionOwnerUserRecordID (Swift)

**Framework:** CloudKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 13.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 6.0+

```

## Discussion

On a system that supports multiple users, such as tvOS, use this identifier to check whether the pending content is for the current user. If your app always fetches data from CloudKit on launch, you may improve efficiency by disregarding notifications for other users.
