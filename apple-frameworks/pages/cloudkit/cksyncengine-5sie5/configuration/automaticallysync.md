```

## Discussion

By default, the sync engine uses the system scheduler to automatically schedule both send and fetch operations. If an operation fails due to a recoverable error, such as a network failure or when the server is enforcing request limits, the engine reschedules those operations as necessary. Unless you have a specific need, prefer to use the default behavior in your app.

If you set this property’s value to `false`, use [fetchChanges(\_:)](../fetchchanges%28__%29.md) and [sendChanges(\_:)](../sendchanges%28__%29.md) to invoke immediate sync operations, allowing for more control over when your app syncs its records. For example, you may want to sync at a specific time of day or deterministically simulate certain conditions in your unit tests.

The default value is `true`.
