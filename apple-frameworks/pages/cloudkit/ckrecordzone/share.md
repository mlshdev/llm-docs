# share (Swift)

**Framework:** CloudKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 15.0+ · iPadOS 15.0+ · Mac Catalyst 15.0+ · macOS 12.0+ · tvOS 15.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 8.0+

## Discussion

CloudKit sets this property only for fetched record zones that contain a share record; otherwise, it’s `nil`.

To share a record zone, create a share record using the [init(recordZoneID:)](../ckshare/init%28recordzoneid_%29.md) method and then save it to the server. Shared record zones must have the [zoneWideSharing](capabilities-swift.struct/zonewidesharing.md) capability, which CloudKit enables by default for new custom record zones in the user’s private database.

A record zone, and the records it contains, can take part in only a single share. CloudKit returns an error if you attempt to share an already-shared record zone, or if that record zone contains previously shared records.

Record zone sharing errors include the following:

- [CKError.Code.serverRecordChanged](../ckerror/code/serverrecordchanged.md), which CloudKit returns if you try to share an already-shared record zone.
- [CKError.Code.serverRejectedRequest](../ckerror/code/serverrejectedrequest.md), which CloudKit returns if you try to share a record hierarchy from an already-shared record zone.
- [CKError.Code.invalidArguments](../ckerror/code/invalidarguments.md), which CloudKit returns if you try to share a record zone that contains one or more shared hierarchies.

CloudKit sets this property only for fetched record zones that contain a share record; otherwise, it’s `nil`.

To share a record zone, create a share record using the [initWithRecordZoneID:](../ckshare/init%28recordzoneid_%29.md) method and then save it to the server.
