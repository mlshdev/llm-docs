# CKRecordZone.EncryptionScope.perZone (Swift)

**Framework:** CloudKit  
**Kind:** Case  
**Availability:** iOS 26.0+ · iPadOS 26.0+ · Mac Catalyst 26.0+ · macOS 26.0+ · tvOS 26.0+ · visionOS 26.0+ · watchOS 26.0+

Zone uses per-zone encryption keys for encrypted values across all records and the zone-wide share, if present.

## Declaration

```swift
case perZone
```

## Discussion

This is an optional optimization that can reduce the overall storage used by encryption keys in a zone. Note that:

- Record zones using per-zone encryption only support zone-wide sharing.
- Encryption scope can only be assigned at zone creation and cannot be changed for the lifetime of the zone.
- The server does not return zones using per-zone encryption to device OS versions older than the corresponding API availability version.
- An older OS trying to overwrite an existing zone using per-zone encryption due to a naming collision results in a `.serverRejectedRequest` error.
- On device OS upgrade, your application is responsible for fetching database changes via `CKFetchDatabaseChangesOperation` with a nil sync token to verify it has received all the zones available to it from the server.
