Modifies the specified subscriptions and returns the results to an awaiting caller.

## Declaration

```swift
func modifySubscriptions(saving subscriptionsToSave: [CKSubscription], deleting subscriptionIDsToDelete: [CKSubscription.ID]) async throws -> (saveResults: [CKSubscription.ID : Result<CKSubscription, any Error>], deleteResults: [CKSubscription.ID : Result<Void, any Error>])
```

## Parameters

- `subscriptionIDsToDelete`: The identifiers of the subscriptions to permanently delete.

## Return Value

A tuple with the following named elements:

- **`saveResults`**: A dictionary of saved subscriptions. The dictionary uses the identifiers of the subscriptions you specify in `subscriptionsToSave` as its keys. The value of each key is a [Result](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/result) that contains either the corresponding modified subscription (as it appears on the server), or an error that describes why CloudKit can’t modify that subscription.
- **`deleteResults`**: A dictionary of deleted subscriptions. The dictionary uses the identifiers you specify in `subscriptionIDsToDelete` as its keys. The value of each key is a [Result](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/result) that contains either [Void](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/void) to indicate a successful deletion, or an error that describes why CloudKit can’t delete that subscription.

## Discussion

This method throws an error if the request fails, such as when the network is unavailable or the device doesn’t have an active iCloud account; otherwise, the returned tuple includes any individual subscription errors.
