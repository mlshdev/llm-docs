# CKSyncEngineWillFetchChangesEvent

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** CloudKit  
**Kind:** Class  
**Availability:** iOS 17.0+ · iPadOS 17.0+ · Mac Catalyst 17.0+ · macOS 14.0+ · tvOS 17.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 10.0+

The sync engine is about to fetch changes from the server.

## Declaration

```objectivec
@interface CKSyncEngineWillFetchChangesEvent : CKSyncEngineEvent
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

The sync engine delivers the changes themselves via [CKSyncEngineFetchedDatabaseChangesEvent](cksyncenginefetcheddatabasechangesevent.md) and [CKSyncEngineFetchedRecordZoneChangesEvent](cksyncenginefetchedrecordzonechangesevent.md).

Note that this event might not always occur every time you call [fetchChangesWithCompletionHandler:](cksyncengine-4b4w9/fetchchangeswithcompletionhandler_.md). For example, if you call [fetchChangesWithCompletionHandler:](cksyncengine-4b4w9/fetchchangeswithcompletionhandler_.md) concurrently while the engine is already fetching changes, this event might not be sent. Similarly, if there’s no logged-in account, the engine might short-circuit the call to `fetchChanges`, and this event won’t be sent.
