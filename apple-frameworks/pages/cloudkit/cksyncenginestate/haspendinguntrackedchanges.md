## Discussion

Use this property to inform the sync engine that there are pending changes other than those available in [pendingRecordZoneChanges](pendingrecordzonechanges.md). After you set this property, the sync engine automatically schedules a send operation and, when that operation executes, asks your delegate to provide those changes by invoking the [syncEngine:nextRecordZoneChangeBatchForContext:](../cksyncenginedelegate-3c38p/syncengine_nextrecordzonechangebatchforcontext_.md) method.

Using this property is optional and is necessary only if you track pending changes manually, outside of the sync engine’s state.
