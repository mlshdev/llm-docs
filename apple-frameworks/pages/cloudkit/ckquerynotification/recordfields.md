## Discussion

For record updates and creations, this property contains the subscription’s desired keys. When you configure the notification info of a subscription, you specify the names of one or more fields in the [desiredKeys](../cksubscription/notificationinfo-swift.class/desiredkeys.md) property. When a push notification triggers, CloudKit retrieves the values for each of those keys from the record and includes them in the notification’s payload.

For query notifications that you fetch from a container, all keys and values are present. For query notifications that you create from push notifications, one or more keys and values may be missing. Push notification payloads have a size limit, and CloudKit can exclude record fields when a payload exceeds that limit. For information about the order, see the overview of this class.
