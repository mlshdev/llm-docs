## Discussion

By default, the sync engine uses the system scheduler to automatically schedule both send and fetch operations. If an operation fails due to a recoverable error, such as a network failure, or when the server is enforcing request limits, the engine reschedules those operations as necessary. Unless you have a specific need, prefer to use the default behavior in your app.

If you set this property’s value to [false](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false), use [fetchChangesWithCompletionHandler:](../cksyncengine-4b4w9/fetchchangeswithcompletionhandler_.md) and [sendChangesWithCompletionHandler:](../cksyncengine-4b4w9/sendchangeswithcompletionhandler_.md) to invoke immediate sync operations, allowing for more control over when your app syncs its records. For example, you may want to sync at a specific time of day, or deterministically simulate certain conditions in your unit tests.

The default value is [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true).
