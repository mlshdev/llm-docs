## Discussion

This property contains an array of strings, each of which corresponds to the name of a field in the record that triggers the notification. When the system receives a notification, it includes the keys and their corresponding values. You can request a maximum of three keys.

For the keys you specify, the allowable types are [NSString](../../../foundation/nsstring.md), [NSNumber](../../../foundation/nsnumber.md), [CLLocation](../../../corelocation/cllocation.md), [NSDate](../../../foundation/nsdate.md), and [CKRecord.Reference](../../ckrecord/reference.md). You can’t specify keys with values that contain other data types. CloudKit may truncate strings that are more than 100 characters when it adds them to the notification’s payload.
