# Managing iCloud Containers with CloudKit Database App (Swift)

**Framework:** CloudKit

Inspect and modify the schema and data for your app’s iCloud container.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

The CloudKit Database app is a web-based tool for developers to manage their iCloud containers. You can sign in to the CloudKit Database app through the Apple Developer web portal or through the CloudKit Console at [https://icloud.developer.apple.com/](https://icloud.developer.apple.com/).

With the CloudKit Database app, you can:

- See all the containers for your account.
- View and edit your development schema, and view your production schema.
- View and edit your test data during development or debugging.
- View logs and metrics for your containers.
- Deploy your schema to production. See [Deploying an iCloud Container’s Schema](deploying-an-icloud-container-s-schema.md).
- Obtain API tokens for use with CloudKit web services and [CloudKit JS](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/cloudkitjs). See [Obtaining an API Token for an iCloud Container](obtaining-an-api-token-for-an-icloud-container.md).

A schema defines record types and the possible relationships between them. You can use CloudKit Database Console or code to create your app’s schema. If you use code to create a just-in-time schema, the CloudKit Database app can help you verify the schema is correct.

To navigate to the iCloud container’s schema management page:

1. Sign in to CloudKit Console at [https://icloud.developer.apple.com/](https://icloud.developer.apple.com/).
2. Select the CloudKit Database from the app list.
3. From the container selection drop-down at the top of the page, choose your app’s container.
4. Click the Record Types menu item in the Schema section to open the container’s schema management page.

After you select the container you want to manage, you can access information about the schema quickly by using the menu items. See [Inspecting and Editing an iCloud Container’s Schema](inspecting-and-editing-an-icloud-container-s-schema.md) for more details.

### Navigate to an iCloud container’s data management page

You can use the CloudKit Database app to inspect data within the public database of an iCloud container. If you develop using the same iCloud account to store private data, you can also use the CloudKit Database app to inspect and edit private data.

Don’t use the CloudKit Database app as a general data editor. Although you can create, modify, and delete records using CloudKit Dashboard, the intent of this functionality is to help you debug your schema during the design phase.

To navigate to the iCloud container’s data management page:

1. Sign in to CloudKit Console at [https://icloud.developer.apple.com/](https://icloud.developer.apple.com/).
2. Select the CloudKit Database from the app list.
3. From the container selection drop-down at the top of the page, choose your app’s container.
4. Click the Records menu item in the Data section to open the container’s data management page.
