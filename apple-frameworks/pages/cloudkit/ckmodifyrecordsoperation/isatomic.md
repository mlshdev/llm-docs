# isAtomic (Swift)

**Framework:** CloudKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ · iPadOS 8.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.10+ · tvOS · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 3.0+

A Boolean value that indicates whether the entire operation fails when CloudKit can’t update one or more records in a record zone.

## Declaration

```swift
var isAtomic: Bool { get set }
```

## Discussion

Modifying records atomically prevents you from updating your data in a way that leaves it in an inconsistent state. You use atomic updates when you want to write multiple records to the same record zone. If there’s a failure to modify any of the records in a zone, CloudKit doesn’t change the other records in that same zone. The record zone must have the [atomic](../ckrecordzone/capabilities-swift.struct/atomic.md) capability for this behavior to apply. If a record zone doesn’t support the atomic capability, setting this property has no effect.

The default value of this property is [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true), which causes all modifications within a single record zone to occur atomically. If your operation contains records in multiple record zones, a failure in one zone doesn’t prevent modifications to records in a different zone. Changing the value of this property to [false](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false) causes CloudKit to modify records individually, regardless of whether the record zone supports atomic modifications.
