## Return Value

## Discussion

CloudKit can translate any valid email address into a share participant. If the email address doesn’t correspond to a known iCloud account, then at share-accept-time, CloudKit offers the accepting participant a vetting process. The accepting participant uses this vetting process to link the email address to an iCloud account.

This method searches for the share participant asynchronously and with a low priority. If you want the task to execute with a higher priority, create an instance of [CKFetchShareParticipantsOperation](../ckfetchshareparticipantsoperation.md) and configure it to use the necessary priority.
