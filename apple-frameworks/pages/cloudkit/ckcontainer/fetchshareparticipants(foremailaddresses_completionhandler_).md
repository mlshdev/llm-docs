## Discussion

The closure doesn’t return a value and takes the following parameters:

- A dictionary of fetched share participants. The dictionary uses the email addresses you specify in `emails` as its keys. The value of each key is a [Result](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/result) that contains either the corresponding fetched share participant, or an error that describes why CloudKit can’t fetch that share participant.

CloudKit can translate any valid email address into a share participant. If the email address doesn’t correspond to a known iCloud account, then at share-accept-time, CloudKit offers the accepting participant a vetting process. The accepting participant uses this vetting process to link the email address to an iCloud account.

This method searches for share participants asynchronously and with a low priority. If you want the task to execute with a higher priority, create an instance of [CKFetchShareParticipantsOperation](../ckfetchshareparticipantsoperation.md) and configure it to use the necessary priority.
