# BlockStorageDeviceDriverKit

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** BlockStorageDeviceDriverKit  
**Kind:** Framework  
**Availability:** DriverKit 21.0+

Develop drivers for custom storage devices that communicate with the driver using custom protocols.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Use `BlockStorageDeviceDriverKit` in conjunction with frameworks like [PCIDriverKit](pcidriverkit.md) to create drivers that can communicate with their hardware using custom storage interconnect protocols.

Develop your driver by subclassing [IOUserBlockStorageDevice](blockstoragedevicedriverkit/iouserblockstoragedevice.md) and overriding all methods the framework declares as C++ pure virtual. Then package your driver in an app that uses the [System Extensions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/systemextensions) framework to install and upgrade the driver on the user’s Mac.

> **Note**

>  BlockStorageDeviceDriverKit is available on macOS.

## Topics

### Essentials

- [com.apple.developer.driverkit.family.block-storage-device](bundleresources/entitlements/com.apple.developer.driverkit.family.block-storage-device.md): A Boolean value that indicates whether to match the driver against block storage devices that use custom drivers.

### Driver Interfaces

- [IOUserBlockStorageDevice](blockstoragedevicedriverkit/iouserblockstoragedevice.md): A DriverKit provider object that manages communications with a block storage device.

### Macros
