# Nonreplicated File Provider extension (Swift)

**Framework:** File Provider  
**Kind:** API Collection

Build a File Provider extension that hosts and manages the user’s local files.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

A nonreplicated File Provider extension must perform all of the following tasks:

- Create placeholders for remote files that you download only as needed.
- Intercept coordinated reads from the host app, so that your file provider can download or update the file with data from the remote server before the read occurs.
- Trigger a notification after coordinated writes from the host app, so that the extension can upload the changes to the remote server as needed.
- Enumerate the stored documents and folders.
- Execute actions—such as importing, moving, renaming, or deleting items—on the stored documents and folders.

Your File Provider extension can add custom actions to the file browser’s context menu using the [File Provider UI](../fileproviderui.md) framework. You can also define custom services to communicate with the host app using [NSFileProviderService](../foundation/nsfileproviderservice.md). Use these interfaces to add features that aren’t provided by the base API.

### Support drag and drop

If your application acts as a drag source for remote documents, override your [NSItemProvider](../foundation/nsitemprovider.md) subclass’s [registerFileRepresentation(forTypeIdentifier:fileOptions:visibility:loadHandler:)](../foundation/nsitemprovider/registerfilerepresentation%28fortypeidentifier_fileoptions_visibility_loadhandler_%29.md) method, and return the URL for the dragged item. This URL is the value returned by your extension’s [urlForItem(withPersistentIdentifier:)](nsfileproviderextension/urlforitem%28withpersistentidentifier_%29.md) method. The URL may refer to a local file or, if you don’t have a local copy, to the file’s placeholder.

If the URL points to a placeholder, the system calls your File Provider extension’s [startProvidingItem(at:completionHandler:)](nsfileproviderextension/startprovidingitem%28at_completionhandler_%29.md) method, giving you the opportunity to download the file.
