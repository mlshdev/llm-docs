# Tracking Your File Provider’s Changes (Swift)

**Framework:** File Provider

Create an enumerator to track changes to your file provider’s content.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

While an enumerator is active, it also tracks any changes to its contents. The system only tracks changes to a document or folder while it has an active enumerator for that item (for example, while a document is open or a folder is being browsed).

> **Note**

>  The system always tracks changes to the working set. If it doesn’t have an active enumerator for the working set, it creates a new one.

When your file provider app or extension identifies a change to its content:

- Call the [NSFileProviderManager](nsfileprovidermanager.md) class’s [signalEnumerator(for:completionHandler:)](nsfileprovidermanager/signalenumerator%28for_completionhandler_%29.md) method to notify the system of the change. Pass the item’s identifier as the `containerItemIdentifier` property.
- If the change affects the working set, call [signalEnumerator(for:completionHandler:)](nsfileprovidermanager/signalenumerator%28for_completionhandler_%29.md) a second time. Pass the [workingSet](nsfileprovideritemidentifier/workingset.md) constant as the `containerItemIdentifier` property. This tells the system to update the working set.

After the system is alerted to the change, it calls [enumerateChanges(for:from:)](nsfileproviderenumerator/enumeratechanges%28for_from_%29.md) on any affected, active enumerations and updates the browser’s user interface as needed. This method is asynchronous. When it’s called, the enumerator gathers information about the items (perhaps from a remote server) in the background, and returns the results to the specified observer (an object that adopts the [NSFileProviderChangeObserver](nsfileproviderchangeobserver.md) protocol).

### Tracking Document Changes

- [Tracking Changes to Documents](tracking-changes-to-documents.md): Track and report changes to open documents.

### Signaling Changes with Push Notifications

- [Using push notifications to signal changes](using-push-notifications-to-signal-changes.md): Send push notifications to a device to signal changes from your server.

### Change Tracking

- [NSFileProviderChangeObserver](nsfileproviderchangeobserver.md): An observer that receives changes and deletions during enumeration.
- [NSFileProviderSyncAnchor](nsfileprovidersyncanchor.md): A synchronization point that represents the last batch of changes returned by the enumerator.

When your file provider app or extension identifies a change to its content:

- Call the [NSFileProviderManager](nsfileprovidermanager.md) class’s [signalEnumeratorForContainerItemIdentifier:completionHandler:](nsfileprovidermanager/signalenumerator%28for_completionhandler_%29.md) method to notify the system of the change. Pass the item’s identifier as the `containerItemIdentifier` property.
- If the change affects the working set, call [signalEnumeratorForContainerItemIdentifier:completionHandler:](nsfileprovidermanager/signalenumerator%28for_completionhandler_%29.md) a second time. Pass the [NSFileProviderWorkingSetContainerItemIdentifier](nsfileprovideritemidentifier/workingset.md) constant as the `containerItemIdentifier` property. This tells the system to update the working set.

After the system is alerted to the change, it calls [enumerateChangesForObserver:fromSyncAnchor:](nsfileproviderenumerator/enumeratechanges%28for_from_%29.md) on any affected, active enumerations and updates the browser’s user interface as needed. This method is asynchronous. When it’s called, the enumerator gathers information about the items (perhaps from a remote server) in the background, and returns the results to the specified observer (an object that adopts the [NSFileProviderChangeObserver](nsfileproviderchangeobserver.md) protocol).
