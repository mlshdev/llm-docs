# saveCurrentTurn(withMatch:completionHandler:) (Swift)

**Framework:** GameKit  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 6.0+ · iPadOS 6.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.8+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 3.0+

Saves your match data in Game Center without ending the turn.

## Declaration

```swift
func saveCurrentTurn(withMatch matchData: Data, completionHandler: (@Sendable ((any Error)?) -> Void)? = nil)
```

```swift
func saveCurrentTurn(withMatch matchData: Data) async throws
```

## Parameters

- `matchData`: Your game-specific data representing the match state. For example, include the current participant’s activity while taking their turn in this object. Don’t pass `nil` as this parameter.
- `completionHandler`: The block that GameKit calls when it completes the request.

  The block receives the following parameter:

  - ***error***: Describes an error if it occurs, or `nil` if the operation completes.

## Discussion

Invoke this method only when the local player is the current participant. To receive turn-based events that this method generates, register a listener that conforms to the [GKTurnBasedEventListener](../gkturnbasedeventlistener.md) protocol with the local player. See [Starting turn-based matches and passing turns between players](../starting-turn-based-matches-and-passing-turns-between-players.md).
