## Discussion

When the player completes the achievement, you can display this image as a placeholder until GameKit downloads the achievement’s image that you upload to App Store Connect.

In macOS versions earlier than macOS 11, this class method returns an [NSImage](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsimage) object but otherwise works the same as in iOS, Mac Catalyst, and tvOS.

Starting with iOS 14, macOS 11, and tvOS 14, this method returns a symbol image. To match your game’s appearance, make adjustments to the symbol image as described in [Configuring and displaying symbol images in your UI](../../uikit/configuring-and-displaying-symbol-images-in-your-ui.md).
