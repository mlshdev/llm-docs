# GKTurnBasedEventHandler (Swift)

**Framework:** GameKit  
**Kind:** Class  
**Availability:** iOS 5.0+ (deprecated in 7.0) · iPadOS 5.0+ (deprecated in 7.0) · Mac Catalyst 5.0+ (deprecated in 7.0) · macOS 10.8+ (deprecated in 10.10) · visionOS 1.0+ (deprecated in 1.0) · watchOS 3.0+ (deprecated in 3.0)

The [GKTurnBasedEventHandler](gkturnbasedeventhandler.md) class is used to respond to important messages related to turn-based matches. To use it, call the [shared()](gkturnbasedeventhandler/shared%28%29.md) class method to get the singleton instance and assign an object that implements the [GKTurnBasedEventHandlerDelegate](gkturnbasedeventhandlerdelegate.md) protocol to its [delegate](gkturnbasedeventhandler/delegate.md) property. All methods are called on the main thread.

## Declaration

```swift
class GKTurnBasedEventHandler
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

> **Important**

>  Your game must initialize a local player before you can use any Game Center classes. If there is no initialized player, your game receives a [GKError.Code.notAuthenticated](gkerror/code/notauthenticated.md) error. For more information, see [Authenticating a player](authenticating-a-player.md).

This framework has been deprecated in iOS 7. Use [GKTurnBasedEventListener](gkturnbasedeventlistener.md).
