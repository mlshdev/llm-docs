# report(completionHandler:) (Swift)

**Framework:** GameKit  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 4.1+ (deprecated in 7.0) · iPadOS 4.1+ (deprecated in 7.0) · Mac Catalyst 4.1+ (deprecated in 7.0) · macOS 10.8+ (deprecated in 10.10) · visionOS 1.0+ (deprecated in 1.0) · watchOS 3.0+ (deprecated in 3.0)

Reports a score to Game Center.

## Declaration

```swift
func report(completionHandler: (@Sendable ((any Error)?) -> Void)? = nil)
```

```swift
func report() async throws
```

## Parameters

- `completionHandler`: A block to be called after the score is reported.

  The block receives the following parameter:

  - ***error***: If an error occurred, this parameter holds an error object that describes the problem. If the score was successfully reported, this parameter’s value is `nil`.

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

The `value` property must be set before calling this method.

When this method is called, it creates a new background task to handle the request. The method then returns control to your game. Later, when the task is complete, GameKit calls your completion handler. The completion handler is always called on the main thread.
