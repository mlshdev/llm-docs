## Discussion

When [isAvailable](isavailable.md) is [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true), the session is visible to other peers based on its [sessionMode](sessionmode.md) property. When [isAvailable](isavailable.md) is set to [false](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false), it remains connected to peers, but is no longer visible to nonconnected peers. The default is [false](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false).

Typically, your application configures the session object with a delegate and data receiver, and then sets [isAvailable](isavailable.md) to [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true). When the delegate finishes connecting to peers, it should set the session’s [isAvailable](isavailable.md) property to [false](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false).
