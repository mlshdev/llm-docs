## Overview

Adopt the [GKLocalPlayerListener](gklocalplayerlistener.md) protocol to listen for and handle a variety of Game Center events for player accounts instead of the individual [GKChallengeListener](gkchallengelistener.md), [GKInviteEventListener](gkinviteeventlistener.md), [GKSavedGameListener](gksavedgamelistener.md), and [GKTurnBasedEventListener](gkturnbasedeventlistener.md) protocols.
