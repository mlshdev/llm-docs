# action (Swift)

**Framework:** PDFKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 11.0+ · iPadOS 11.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.5+ · tvOS 11.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

Returns the action performed when users click the outline.

## Declaration

```swift
var action: PDFAction? { get set }
```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

The root outline serves only as a container for the outlines it owns; it does not have an action. Note that a `PDFOutline` object can have either an action or a destination, not both.

If the `PDFOutline` object has a destination, instead of an action,  `action` returns a [PDFActionGoTo](../pdfactiongoto.md) object (this is equivalent to calling [destination](destination.md) on the `PDFOutline` object). For other action types, `action` returns the appropriate PDF Kit action type object, such as [PDFActionURL](../pdfactionurl.md).
