# GLKMatrix4InvertAndTranspose(\_:\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** GLKit  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** iOS 5.0+ · iPadOS 5.0+ · macOS 10.8+ · tvOS 9.0+

Returns the inverse transpose of a matrix.

## Declaration

```swift
func GLKMatrix4InvertAndTranspose(_ matrix: GLKMatrix4, _ isInvertible: UnsafeMutablePointer<Bool>?) -> GLKMatrix4
```

## Parameters

- `matrix`: A `4x4` matrix.
- `isInvertible`: On return, this holds [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true) if the matrix was inverted or [false](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false) if the matrix is not invertible.

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

If `isInvertible` was set to [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true), this holds an inverted and transposed matrix. Otherwise, the identity matrix is returned.
