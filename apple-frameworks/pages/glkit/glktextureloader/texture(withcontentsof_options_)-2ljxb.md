# texture(withContentsOf:options:) (Swift)

**Framework:** GLKit  
**Kind:** Type Method  
**Availability:** iOS 5.0+ (deprecated in 12.0) · iPadOS 5.0+ (deprecated in 12.0) · macOS 10.8+ (deprecated in 10.14) · tvOS 9.0+ (deprecated in 12.0)

Loads a 2D texture image from a memory range and creates a new texture from the data.

> OpenGLES API deprecated. (Define GLES_SILENCE_DEPRECATION to silence these warnings)

## Declaration

```swift
class func texture(withContentsOf data: Data, options: [String : NSNumber]? = nil) throws -> GLKTextureInfo
```

## Parameters

- `data`: The memory range to load as a texture.
- `options`: A dictionary that describes any additional steps you want the texture loader to take when loading the texture. See [Texture Loading Options](../texture-loading-options.md).

## Return Value

A texture info object that describes the loaded texture or `nil` if an error occurred.

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

This class method loads the texture into the sharegroup attached to the current context for the thread this method is called on.

> **Handling Errors in Swift**

>  In Swift, this method returns a nonoptional result and is marked with the `throws` keyword to indicate that it throws an error in cases of failure.
>
> You call this method in a `try` expression and handle any errors in the `catch` clauses of a `do` statement, as described in [Error Handling](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/ErrorHandling.html) in [The Swift Programming Language](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/) and `About Imported Cocoa Error Parameters`.
