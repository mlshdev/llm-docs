# Modern rendering with Metal

**Interface languages:** Swift, Objective-C

**Framework:** Metal  
**Kind:** Sample Code  
**Availability:** iOS 17.0+ · iPadOS 17.0+ · Mac Catalyst 17.0+ · macOS 14.0+ · Xcode 26.3+

Use advanced Metal features such as indirect command buffers, sparse textures, and variable rate rasterization to implement complex rendering techniques.

### Configure the sample code project

Because this sample app uses indirect command buffers, you can’t run this sample in the Simulator — you need to run it on a device. To run this sample, use one of the following:

- A Mac from mid-2016 and later with macOS 11 and later
- An iPad with A11 Bionic and later using iPadOS 14.1 and later
- An iOS device with A11 Bionic and later using iOS 14.1 and later
- Xcode 12 and later
