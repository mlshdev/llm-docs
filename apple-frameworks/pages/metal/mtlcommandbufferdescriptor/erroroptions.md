# errorOptions (Swift)

**Framework:** Metal  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 14.0+ · iPadOS 14.0+ · Mac Catalyst 14.0+ · macOS 11.0+ · tvOS 14.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

The reporting configuration that indicates which information the GPU driver stores in a command buffer’s error property.

## Declaration

```swift
var errorOptions: MTLCommandBufferErrorOption { get set }
```

## Discussion

By default, a GPU driver doesn’t report additional error information.

To create a command buffer that saves additional GPU runtime error information, add the [encoderExecutionStatus](../mtlcommandbuffererroroption/encoderexecutionstatus.md) option to this property. If the GPU encounters an error as it runs the command buffer, you can retrieve the additional information from the command buffer’s [error](../mtlcommandbuffer/error.md) property.

> **Note**

>  Enabling the [encoderExecutionStatus](../mtlcommandbuffererroroption/encoderexecutionstatus.md) option can slightly reduce your app’s CPU runtime performance.

- [logState](logstate.md): The shader logging configuration that the command buffer uses.
- [retainedReferences](retainedreferences.md): A Boolean value that indicates whether the command buffer the descriptor creates maintains strong references to the resources it uses.
- [MTLCommandBufferErrorOption](../mtlcommandbuffererroroption.md): Options for reporting errors from a command buffer.
