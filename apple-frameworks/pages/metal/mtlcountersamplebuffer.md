## Overview

Create a counter sample buffer by calling an [MTLDevice](mtldevice.md) instance’s [makeCounterSampleBuffer(descriptor:)](mtldevice/makecountersamplebuffer%28descriptor_%29.md) method. See [Creating a counter sample buffer to store a GPU’s counter data during a pass](creating-a-counter-sample-buffer-to-store-a-gpus-counter-data-during-a-pass.md).

You can store a GPU device’s counter set data only with an [MTLCounterSampleBuffer](mtlcountersamplebuffer.md) instance that you create from the same device. See [Sampling GPU data into counter sample buffers](sampling-gpu-data-into-counter-sample-buffers.md) for information about storing counter sample data in a counter sample buffer.

## Topics

### Resolving the counter sample buffer’s data

- [resolveCounterRange(\_:)](mtlcountersamplebuffer/resolvecounterrange%28__%29.md): Transforms samples of a GPU’s counter set from the driver’s internal format to a standard Metal data structure.

### Inspecting the counter sample buffer’s configuration

- [label](mtlcountersamplebuffer/label.md): A string that identifies the counter sample buffer.
- [device](mtlcountersamplebuffer/device.md): The GPU device instance that owns the counter sample buffer.
- [sampleCount](mtlcountersamplebuffer/samplecount.md): The number of samples in the buffer.

## Relationships

### Counter sample buffers

- [Creating a counter sample buffer to store a GPU’s counter data during a pass](creating-a-counter-sample-buffer-to-store-a-gpus-counter-data-during-a-pass.md): Make a buffer that provides a place for a GPU to save its runtime performance metrics as it runs a pass.
- [MTLCounterSampleBufferDescriptor](mtlcountersamplebufferdescriptor.md): A group of properties that configures the counter sample buffers you create with it.
- [Sampling GPU data into counter sample buffers](sampling-gpu-data-into-counter-sample-buffers.md): Retrieve a GPU’s counter data at a time the GPU supports.
- [MTLCounterDontSample](mtlcounterdontsample.md): A sentinel value that instructs an encoder to skip sampling a counter as the GPU runs the encoder’s pass.
