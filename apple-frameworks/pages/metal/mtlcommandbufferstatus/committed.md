# MTLCommandBufferStatus.committed (Swift)

**Framework:** Metal  
**Kind:** Case  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ · iPadOS 8.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.11+ · tvOS · visionOS 1.0+

A command buffer’s third state, which indicates the command queue is preparing to schedule the command buffer by resolving its dependencies.

## Declaration

```swift
case committed
```

### Command buffer states

- [MTLCommandBufferStatus.notEnqueued](notenqueued.md): A command buffer’s initial state, which indicates its command queue isn’t reserving a place for it.
- [MTLCommandBufferStatus.enqueued](enqueued.md): A command buffer’s second state, which indicates its command queue is reserving a place for it.
- [MTLCommandBufferStatus.scheduled](scheduled.md): A command buffer’s fourth state, which indicates the command buffer has its resources ready and is waiting for the GPU to run its commands.
- [MTLCommandBufferStatus.completed](completed.md): A command buffer’s successful, final state, which indicates the GPU finished running the command buffer’s commands without any problems.
- [MTLCommandBufferStatus.error](error.md): A command buffer’s unsuccessful, final state, which indicates the GPU stopped running the buffer’s commands because of a runtime issue.
