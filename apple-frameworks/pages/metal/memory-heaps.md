# Memory heaps (Swift)

**Framework:** Metal  
**Kind:** API Collection

Take control of your app’s GPU memory management by creating a large memory allocation for various buffers, textures, and other resources.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Use an [MTLHeap](mtlheap.md) to quickly create and destroy GPU resources. Heaps can also help your apps save memory by aliasing portions of it in multiple places.

Create a heap by calling an [MTLDevice](mtldevice.md) instance’s [makeHeap(descriptor:)](mtldevice/makeheap%28descriptor_%29.md) method.

> **Note**

>  Metal only synchronizes resources that you create from a Metal heap and that have the [hazardTrackingMode](mtlheap/hazardtrackingmode.md) property set to [MTLHazardTrackingMode.tracked](mtlhazardtrackingmode/tracked.md).

## Topics

### Resource memory allocation and management

- [Using argument buffers with resource heaps](using-argument-buffers-with-resource-heaps.md): Reduce CPU overhead by using arrays inside argument buffers and combining them with resource heaps.
- [Implementing a multistage image filter using heaps and events](implementing-a-multistage-image-filter-using-heaps-and-events.md): Use events to synchronize access to resources allocated on a heap.
- [Implementing a multistage image filter using heaps and fences](implementing-a-multistage-image-filter-using-heaps-and-fences.md): Use fences to synchronize access to resources allocated on a heap.
- [MTLHeap](mtlheap.md): A memory pool from which you can suballocate resources.
- [MTLHeapDescriptor](mtlheapdescriptor.md): A configuration that customizes the behavior for a Metal memory heap.
- [MTLHeapType](mtlheaptype.md): The options you use to choose the heap type.
- [MTLSizeAndAlign](mtlsizeandalign.md): The size and alignment of a resource, in bytes.

### Resources

- [Resource fundamentals](resource-fundamentals.md): Control the common attributes of all Metal memory resources, including buffers and textures, and how to configure their underlying memory.
- [Buffers](buffers.md): Create and manage untyped data your app uses to exchange information with its shader functions.
- [Textures](textures.md): Create and manage typed data your app uses to exchange information with its shader functions.
- [Resource loading](resource-loading.md): Load assets in your games and apps quickly by running a dedicated input/output queue alongside your GPU tasks.
- [Resource synchronization](resource-synchronization.md): Prevent multiple commands that can access the same resources simultaneously by coordinating those reads and writes with barriers, fences, or events.
