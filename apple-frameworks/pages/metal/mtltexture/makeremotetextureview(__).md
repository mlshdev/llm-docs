# makeRemoteTextureView(\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Metal  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** macOS 10.15+ (deprecated in 27.0)

Creates a remote texture view for another GPU in the same peer group.

> Not applicable on Apple Silicon

## Declaration

```swift
func makeRemoteTextureView(_ device: any MTLDevice) -> (any MTLTexture)?
```

## Discussion

The device instance that created this texture and the device instance passed into this method need to have the same nonzero peer group identifier ([peerGroupID](../mtldevice/peergroupid.md)). This texture needs to either use the private storage mode ([MTLStorageMode.private](../mtlstoragemode/private.md)) or be backed by an [IOSurface](../../iosurface/iosurface.md).

A remote view doesn’t allocate any storage for the new texture; it references the memory allocated for the original texture. You can use remote views only as a source for copy commands encoded by an [MTLBlitCommandEncoder](../mtlblitcommandencoder.md). For more information, see [Transferring data between connected GPUs](../transferring-data-between-connected-gpus.md).
