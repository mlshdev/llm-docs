# setComputePipelineState(\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Metal  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ · iPadOS 8.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.11+ · tvOS · visionOS 1.0+

Configures the compute encoder with a pipeline state for subsequent kernel calls.

## Declaration

```swift
func setComputePipelineState(_ state: any MTLComputePipelineState)
```

## Parameters

- `state`: An [MTLComputePipelineState](../mtlcomputepipelinestate.md) instance.

## Discussion

> **Important**

>  Set a compute encoder’s pipeline state before encoding any commands. Encoding commands without an available pipeline state causes an error.

Create your pipeline state through one of the [MTLDevice](../mtldevice.md) methods in Creating Compute Pipeline States.

A compute pipeline state provides information Metal uses to compile and run encoded commands. You can change the pipeline state at any time, allowing you to encode multiple kernel calls in a single command buffer. Changing the pipeline state doesn’t affect any previously encoded commands.
