# useResource(\_:usage:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Metal  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 11.0+ · iPadOS 11.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.13+ · tvOS 11.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

Ensures kernel calls that the system encodes in subsequent commands have access to a resource.

## Declaration

```swift
func useResource(_ resource: any MTLResource, usage: MTLResourceUsage)
```

## Parameters

- `resource`: An [MTLResource](../mtlresource.md) instance used in an argument buffer.
- `usage`: How the compute pass can access data, including [read](../mtlresourceusage/read.md) and [write](../mtlresourceusage/write.md) permission.

  For applicable resources, you may be able to prevent the GPU from unnecessarily decompressing color attachments on some devices by setting `usage` to [read](../mtlresourceusage/read.md).

## Mentioned In

- [Simplifying GPU resource management with residency sets](../simplifying-gpu-resource-management-with-residency-sets.md)
- [Tracking the resource residency of argument buffers](../tracking-the-resource-residency-of-argument-buffers.md)

## Discussion

You can make a resource *resident* (available in GPU memory) for the remaining duration of the compute pass by calling this method. Call the method before encoding function calls that may access the `resource` through an argument buffer. The method ensures the resource is in a format that’s compatible with the kernels that depend on it.

> **Note**

>  You don’t need to call this method if you bind a resource for compute kernels to access.

The method also informs Metal when to apply hazard tracking for a resource you create with [MTLHazardTrackingMode.tracked](../mtlhazardtrackingmode/tracked.md). For a resource you create with [MTLHazardTrackingMode.untracked](../mtlhazardtrackingmode/untracked.md), you need to apply an [MTLFence](../mtlfence.md) or an [MTLEvent](../mtlevent.md) to account for potential reading and writing hazards.

You can reconfigure an individual resource’s `usage` options for subsequent draw calls in the same render pass by calling this method again.

Apps typically call this method for a resource in an argument buffer as a part of their *bindless* implementation. For more information about argument buffers and bindless implementations, see [Improving CPU performance by using argument buffers](../improving-cpu-performance-by-using-argument-buffers.md) and [Go bindless with Metal 3](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10101/), respectively.

- [useResources(\_:usage:)](useresources%28__usage_%29.md): Ensures kernel calls that the system encodes in subsequent commands have access to multiple resources.
