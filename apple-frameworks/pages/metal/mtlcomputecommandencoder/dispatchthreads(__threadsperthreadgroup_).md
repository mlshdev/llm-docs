# dispatchThreads(\_:threadsPerThreadgroup:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Metal  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 11.0+ · iPadOS 11.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.13+ · tvOS 14.5+ · visionOS 1.0+

Encodes a compute command using an arbitrarily sized grid.

## Declaration

```swift
func dispatchThreads(_ threadsPerGrid: MTLSize, threadsPerThreadgroup: MTLSize)
```

## Parameters

- `threadsPerGrid`: The number of threads in the grid, in each dimension.
- `threadsPerThreadgroup`: The number of threads in one threadgroup, in each dimension.

## Mentioned In

## Discussion

> **Warning**

>  Use this method only if the device your app is running on supports nonuniform threadgroup sizes. Check for device capabilities with [supportsFamily(\_:)](../mtldevice/supportsfamily%28__%29.md) on the device providing your compute command encoder. See [Metal Feature Set Tables (PDF)](https://developer.apple.com/metal/Metal-Feature-Set-Tables.pdf) for device support information.

This method encodes a call that uses an arbitrary number of threads in its execution grid. Metal calculates the number of threadgroups needed, providing partial threadgroups if necessary. Prefer this method to [dispatchThreadgroups(\_:threadsPerThreadgroup:)](dispatchthreadgroups%28__threadsperthreadgroup_%29.md) if your app requires bounds checking or you need extra data allocations to saturate a uniform grid.
