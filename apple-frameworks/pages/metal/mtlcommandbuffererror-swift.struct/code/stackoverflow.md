# MTLCommandBufferError.Code.stackOverflow (Swift)

**Framework:** Metal  
**Kind:** Case  
**Availability:** iOS 15.0+ · iPadOS 15.0+ · Mac Catalyst 15.0+ · macOS 12.0+ · tvOS 15.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

An error code that indicates the GPU terminated the command buffer because a kernel function of tile shader used too many stack frames.

## Declaration

```swift
case stackOverflow
```

## Discussion

You can set the largest number of stack frames your pipelines by configuring these properties:

- [MTLComputePipelineDescriptor](../../mtlcomputepipelinedescriptor.md)`.`[maxCallStackDepth](../../mtlcomputepipelinedescriptor/maxcallstackdepth.md) for kernel functions
- [MTLTileRenderPipelineDescriptor](../../mtltilerenderpipelinedescriptor.md)`.`[maxCallStackDepth](../../mtltilerenderpipelinedescriptor/maxcallstackdepth.md) for tile shaders

### Error codes

- [MTLCommandBufferError.Code.none](none.md): An error code that represents the absence of any problems.
- [MTLCommandBufferError.Code.timeout](timeout.md): An error code that indicates the system interrupted and terminated the command buffer before it finished running.
- [MTLCommandBufferError.Code.pageFault](pagefault.md): An error code that indicates the command buffer generated a page fault the GPU can’t service.
- [MTLCommandBufferError.Code.notPermitted](notpermitted.md): An error code that indicates a process doesn’t have access to a GPU device.
- [MTLCommandBufferError.Code.outOfMemory](outofmemory.md): An error code that indicates the GPU device doesn’t have sufficient memory to execute a command buffer.
- [MTLCommandBufferError.Code.invalidResource](invalidresource.md): An error code that indicates the command buffer has an invalid reference to resource.
- [MTLCommandBufferError.Code.memoryless](memoryless.md): An error code that indicates the GPU ran out of one or more of its internal resources that support memoryless render pass attachments.
- [MTLCommandBufferError.Code.deviceRemoved](deviceremoved.md): Deprecated. An error code that indicates a person physically removed the GPU device before the command buffer finished running.
- [accessRevoked](accessrevoked.md): An error code that indicates the system has revoked the Metal device’s access because it’s responsible for too many timeouts or hangs.
- [MTLCommandBufferError.Code.internal](internal.md): An error code that indicates the Metal framework has an internal problem.
