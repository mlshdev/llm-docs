Encodes a command that copies image data from a slice of a texture instance to a buffer, with options for special texture formats.

## Declaration

```swift
func copy(sourceTexture: any MTLTexture, sourceSlice: Int, sourceLevel: Int, sourceOrigin: MTLOrigin, sourceSize: MTLSize, destinationBuffer: any MTLBuffer, destinationOffset: Int, destinationBytesPerRow: Int, destinationBytesPerImage: Int, options: MTLBlitOption = [])
```

## Parameters

- `sourceTexture`: An [MTLTexture](../mtltexture.md) texture that the command copies data from. To read the source texture contents, you need to set its [isFramebufferOnly](../mtltexture/isframebufferonly.md) property to [false](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false) prior to drawing into it.
- `sourceSlice`: A slice within `sourceTexture` the command uses as a starting point to copy data from. Set this to `0` if `sourceTexture` isn’t a texture array or a cube texture.
- `sourceLevel`: A mipmap level within `sourceTexture`.
- `sourceOrigin`: An [MTLOrigin](../mtlorigin.md) instance that represents a location within `sourceTexture` that the command begins copying data from. Assign `0` to each dimension that’s not relevant to `sourceTexture`.
- `sourceSize`: An [MTLSize](../mtlsize.md) instance that represents the size of the region, in pixels, that the command copies from `sourceTexture`, starting at `sourceOrigin`. Assign `1` to each dimension that’s not relevant to `sourceTexture`. If `sourceTexture` uses a compressed pixel format, set `sourceSize` to a multiple of the `sourceTexture's` [pixelFormat](../mtltexture/pixelformat.md) block size. If the block extends outside the bounds of the texture, clamp `sourceSize` to the edge of the texture.
- `destinationBuffer`: An [MTLBuffer](../mtlbuffer.md) instance the command copies data to.
- `destinationOffset`: A byte offset within `destinationBuffer` the command copies to. The value you provide as this argument needs to be a multiple of `sourceTexture's` pixel size, in bytes.
- `destinationBytesPerRow`: The number of bytes between adjacent rows of pixels in `destinationBuffer`. This value must be a multiple of `sourceTexture's` pixel size, in bytes, and less than or equal to the product of `sourceTexture's` pixel size, in bytes, and the largest pixel width `sourceTexture’s` type allows. If `sourceTexture` uses a compressed pixel format, set `destinationBytesPerRow` to the number of bytes between the starts of two row blocks.
- `destinationBytesPerImage`: The number of bytes between each 2D image of a 3D texture. This value must be a multiple of `sourceTexture's` pixel size, in bytes. Set this value to `0` if `sourceSize's` [depth](../mtlsize/depth.md) value is `1`.
- `options`: A [MTLBlitOption](../mtlblitoption.md) value that applies to textures with applicable pixel formats, such as combined depth/stencil or PVRTC formats. If `sourceTexture's` [pixelFormat](../mtltexture/pixelformat.md) is a combined depth/stencil format, set `options` to either [depthFromDepthStencil](../mtlblitoption/depthfromdepthstencil.md) or [stencilFromDepthStencil](../mtlblitoption/stencilfromdepthstencil.md), but not both. If `sourceTexture's` [pixelFormat](../mtltexture/pixelformat.md) is a PVRTC format, set `options` to [rowLinearPVRTC](../mtlblitoption/rowlinearpvrtc.md).
