# writeTimestamp(granularity:counterHeap:index:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Metal  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 26.0+ · iPadOS 26.0+ · Mac Catalyst 26.0+ · macOS 26.0+ · tvOS 26.0+ · visionOS 26.0+

Writes a GPU timestamp into a heap.

## Declaration

```swift
func writeTimestamp(granularity: MTL4TimestampGranularity, counterHeap: any MTL4CounterHeap, index: Int)
```

## Parameters

- `granularity`: [MTL4TimestampGranularity](../mtl4timestampgranularity.md) hint to Metal about acceptable the level of precision.
- `counterHeap`: [MTL4CounterHeap](../mtl4counterheap.md) to write timestamps into.
- `index`: The index value into which Metal writes the timestamp.

## Discussion

The method ensures that any prior work finishes, but doesn’t delay any subsequent work.

You can alter this command’s behavior through the `granularity` parameter.

- Pass [MTL4TimestampGranularity.relaxed](../mtl4timestampgranularity/relaxed.md) to allow Metal to provide timestamps with minimal impact to runtime performance, but with less detail. For example, the command may group all timestamps for a pass together.
- Pass [MTL4TimestampGranularity.precise](../mtl4timestampgranularity/precise.md) to request that Metal provides timestamps with the most detail. This can affect runtime performance.

# writeTimestampWithGranularity:intoHeap:atIndex: (Objective-C)

**Framework:** Metal  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 26.0+ · iPadOS 26.0+ · Mac Catalyst 26.0+ · macOS 26.0+ · tvOS 26.0+ · visionOS 26.0+

Writes a GPU timestamp into a heap.

## Declaration

```objectivec
- (void) writeTimestampWithGranularity:(MTL4TimestampGranularity) granularity intoHeap:(id<MTL4CounterHeap>) counterHeap atIndex:(NSUInteger) index;
```

## Parameters

- `granularity`: [MTL4TimestampGranularity](../mtl4timestampgranularity.md) hint to Metal about acceptable the level of precision.
- `counterHeap`: [MTL4CounterHeap](../mtl4counterheap.md) to write timestamps into.
- `index`: The index value into which Metal writes the timestamp.

The method ensures that any prior work finishes, but doesn’t delay any subsequent work.

You can alter this command’s behavior through the `granularity` parameter.

- Pass [MTL4TimestampGranularityRelaxed](../mtl4timestampgranularity/relaxed.md) to allow Metal to provide timestamps with minimal impact to runtime performance, but with less detail. For example, the command may group all timestamps for a pass together.
- Pass [MTL4TimestampGranularityPrecise](../mtl4timestampgranularity/precise.md) to request that Metal provides timestamps with the most detail. This can affect runtime performance.
