# minLOD (Swift)

**Framework:** Metal  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 27.0+ · iPadOS 27.0+ · Mac Catalyst 27.0+ · macOS 27.0+ · tvOS 27.0+ · visionOS 27.0+

The minimum level of detail for texture views you create with the descriptor.

## Declaration

```swift
var minLOD: Float { get set }
```

## Discussion

The property configures the lower limit of the level-of-detail (LOD) range that texture operations access for texture views you create with the descriptor. When the GPU calculates a mipmap level, it applies the value of this property as the final step, after clamping the sampler LOD and applying the texture view level range offsets. The default value is `0.0`.

Each of the following texture operations has a requirement for the `minLOD` value.

| Operation | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Read | `floor(minLOD)` ≤ mip level |
| Gather | `floor(minLOD)` ≤ `levelRange.location` |
| Sample | `minLOD` ≤ `levelRange.location` \+ `levelRange.length` |

Each operation returns an out-of-bounds value if a parameter doesn’t meet a requirement.

> **Note**

> For the specific out-of-bounds value for each operation, see the *Texture Functions* section of the [Metal Shading Language Specification (PDF)](https://developer.apple.com/metal/Metal-Shading-Language-Specification.pdf).
