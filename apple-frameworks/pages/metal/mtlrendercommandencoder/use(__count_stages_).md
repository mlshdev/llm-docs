# use(\_:count:stages:)

**Framework:** Metal

Ensures the shaders in the render pass’s subsequent draw commands have access to the resources you allocate from multiple heaps.

> Call [useHeaps(\_:stages:)](useheaps%28__stages_%29.md) instead.

## Declaration

```swift
func use(_ heaps: UnsafePointer<any MTLHeap>, count: Int, stages: MTLRenderStages)
```

## Parameters

- `heaps`: A pointer to a C array of [MTLHeap](../mtlheap.md) instances with resources that subsequent draw commands depend on.
- `count`: The number of elements in `heaps`.
- `stages`: All the render stages that depend on resources within `heaps`, including [object](../mtlrenderstages/object.md), [mesh](../mtlrenderstages/mesh.md), [vertex](../mtlrenderstages/vertex.md), [fragment](../mtlrenderstages/fragment.md), and [tile](../mtlrenderstages/tile.md).

## Discussion

You can make the resources in `heaps` *resident* (available in GPU memory) for the remaining duration of the render pass by calling this method. Call the method before encoding draw calls that may access resources within `heaps` through an argument buffer. The method ensures each resource is in a format that’s compatible with the shaders that depend on it.

The method’s applies the [read](../mtlresourceusage/read.md) resource usage option to all of the resources within `heaps`, except for textures. The method ignores any texture that has [renderTarget](../mtltextureusage/rendertarget.md), [shaderWrite](../mtltextureusage/shaderwrite.md), or both in its [usage](../mtltexture/usage.md) property. For all other textures in `heaps`, the method optimizes each texture’s memory layout for rendering with a sampler. However, your shaders can’t read from those textures by calling this method because the texture needs a different memory layout that’s suitable for reading.

> **Important**

>  You can instruct Metal to allow a shader to read from texture or write to other resources in heap, by calling [useResource(\_:usage:stages:)](useresource%28__usage_stages_%29.md).

Methods that apply a usage option for resources (see [Argument buffer resource preparation commands](../argument-buffer-resource-preparation-commands.md)) override any previous calls that apply to a resource. For example, you can change the usage option for a buffer to [write](../mtlresourceusage/write.md) by passing it to [useResource(\_:usage:stages:)](useresource%28__usage_stages_%29.md) after calling this method. However, you can’t reverse the call order because this method resets the usage for all resources within `heaps` to [read](../mtlresourceusage/read.md), overriding previous calls to [useResource(\_:usage:stages:)](useresource%28__usage_stages_%29.md).

The method instructs Metal to apply hazard tracking for resources you allocate from a heap that you create with [MTLHazardTrackingMode.tracked](../mtlhazardtrackingmode/tracked.md). However, for untracked resources — which come from heaps you create with [MTLHazardTrackingMode.untracked](../mtlhazardtrackingmode/untracked.md) — you need to account for hazards by applying [MTLFence](../mtlfence.md) or [MTLEvent](../mtlevent.md) instances.

> **Note**

>  The [hazardTrackingMode](../mtlheapdescriptor/hazardtrackingmode.md) property of a new [MTLHeapDescriptor](../mtlheapdescriptor.md) instance is [MTLHazardTrackingMode.default](../mtlhazardtrackingmode/default.md), which is equivalent to [MTLHazardTrackingMode.untracked](../mtlhazardtrackingmode/untracked.md) because heaps don’t track resources by default.

Apps typically call the method for heaps that have resources in argument buffers for a *bindless* implementation. For more information about argument buffers and bindless implementations, see [Improving CPU performance by using argument buffers](../improving-cpu-performance-by-using-argument-buffers.md) and [Go bindless with Metal 3](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10101/), respectively.
