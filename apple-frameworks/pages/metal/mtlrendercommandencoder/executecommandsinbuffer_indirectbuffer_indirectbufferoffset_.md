# executeCommandsInBuffer:indirectBuffer:indirectBufferOffset:

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** Metal  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.14+ · tvOS 13.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

Encodes a command that runs an indirect range of commands from an indirect command buffer (ICB).

## Declaration

```objectivec
- (void) executeCommandsInBuffer:(id<MTLIndirectCommandBuffer>) indirectCommandbuffer indirectBuffer:(id<MTLBuffer>) indirectRangeBuffer indirectBufferOffset:(NSUInteger) indirectBufferOffset;
```

## Parameters

- `indirectCommandbuffer`: An [MTLIndirectCommandBuffer](../mtlindirectcommandbuffer.md) instance that contains other commands the current command runs.
- `indirectRangeBuffer`: An [MTLBuffer](../mtlbuffer.md) instance with data that matches the layout of the [MTLIndirectCommandBufferExecutionRange](../mtlindirectcommandbufferexecutionrange.md) structure.

  The [length](../mtlindirectcommandbufferexecutionrange/length.md) property of that structure needs to be less than or equal to `0x4000` (`16,384`).
- `indirectBufferOffset`: An integer that represents the location, in bytes, from the start of `indirectRangeBuffer` where the execution range structure begins.

  See the [Metal feature set tables (PDF)](https://developer.apple.com/metal/Metal-Feature-Set-Tables.pdf) to check for offset alignment requirements for buffers in `device` and `constant` address space.
