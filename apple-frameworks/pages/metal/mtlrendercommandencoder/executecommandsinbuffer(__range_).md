# executeCommandsInBuffer(\_:range:)

**Framework:** Metal  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 12.0+ · iPadOS 12.0+ · Mac Catalyst 12.0+ · macOS 10.14+ · tvOS 12.0+ · visionOS

Encodes a command that runs a range of commands from an indirect command buffer (ICB).

## Declaration

```swift
func executeCommandsInBuffer(_ buffer: any MTLIndirectCommandBuffer, range: Range<Int>)
```

## Parameters

- `buffer`: An [MTLIndirectCommandBuffer](../mtlindirectcommandbuffer.md) instance that contains other commands the current command runs.
- `range`: A span of integers that represent the command entries in `buffer` the current command runs. When running on Metal devices that belong to the [MTLGPUFamily.mac2](../mtlgpufamily/mac2.md) GPU family, the number of commands needs to be less than or equal to 0x4000 (16,384). Metal devices that belong to an Apple silicon family, such as [MTLGPUFamily.apple10](../mtlgpufamily/apple10.md), don’t have this limitation.
