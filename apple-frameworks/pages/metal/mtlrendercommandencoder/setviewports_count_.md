# setViewports:count:

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** Metal  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 12.0+ · iPadOS 12.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.13+ · tvOS 14.5+ · visionOS 1.0+

Configures the render pipeline with multiple viewports that apply transformations and clipping rectangles.

## Declaration

```objectivec
- (void) setViewports:(const MTLViewport[]) viewports count:(NSUInteger) count;
```

## Parameters

- `viewports`: An array of [MTLViewport](../mtlviewport.md) instances the command applies to the render pipeline for transformations and clipping.
- `count`: The number of elements in the `viewports` array.

## Discussion

Use this method to configure multiple active viewports and corresponding scissor rectangles. Multiple viewports give your app the ability to draw into separate areas of an image with a single draw call. You can either set a single scissor rectangle for all viewports with the [setScissorRect:](setscissorrect%28__%29.md) method, or set each viewport’s rectangle with the [setScissorRects(\_:)](setscissorrects%28__%29.md) method.

> **Important**

>  The number of scissor rectangles you pass to [setScissorRects(\_:)](setscissorrects%28__%29.md) needs to match the number of viewports you configure with this method.

The maximum number of viewports and scissor rectangles a GPU supports varies by device family. For more information, see [MTLGPUFamily](../mtlgpufamily.md) and [Detecting GPU features and Metal software versions](../detecting-gpu-features-and-metal-software-versions.md).

The rendering pipeline sends each primitive to a single viewport and its associated scissor rectangle. You can select which viewport each primitive uses in your vertex shader by adding the `[[viewport_array_index]]` attribute to an output value.

The render pipeline linearly maps vertex positions from normalized device coordinates to viewport coordinates by applying a viewport during the rasterization stage. It applies the transform first and then rasterizes the primitive while clipping any fragments outside the scissor rectangle (see [setScissorRect:](setscissorrect%28__%29.md)) or the render target’s extents.

The viewport’s [originX](../mtlviewport/originx.md) and [originY](../mtlviewport/originy.md) properties, which default to `0.0`, represent the number of pixels from the top-left corner of the render target. Positive [originX](../mtlviewport/originx.md) values go to the right and positive [originY](../mtlviewport/originy.md) values go downward. The default values for its [width](../mtlviewport/width.md) and [height](../mtlviewport/height.md) properties are the render target’s width and height, respectively. The default values for its [znear](../mtlviewport/znear.md) and [zfar](../mtlviewport/zfar.md) properties are `0.0` and `1.0`, respectively, which you can flip.

> **Note**

>  You can change the render pass’s viewport configuration by calling this method again or by calling the [setViewport:](setviewport%28__%29.md) method.

The [setViewport:](setviewport%28__%29.md) method is equivalent to calling this method with a single viewport element in the `viewports` array.
