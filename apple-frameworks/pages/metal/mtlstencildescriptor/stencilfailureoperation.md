# stencilFailureOperation (Swift)

**Framework:** Metal  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ · iPadOS 8.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.11+ · tvOS · visionOS 1.0+

The operation that is performed to update the values in the stencil attachment when the stencil test fails.

## Declaration

```swift
var stencilFailureOperation: MTLStencilOperation { get set }
```

<a id="discussion"></a>

## Discussion

The default value is [MTLStencilOperation.keep](../mtlstenciloperation/keep.md), which does not change the current stencil value. For more information on possible values, see [MTLStencilOperation](../mtlstenciloperation.md).

When the stencil test fails for a pixel, its incoming color, depth, or stencil values are discarded.

### Configuring stencil functions and operations

- [depthFailureOperation](depthfailureoperation.md): The operation that is performed to update the values in the stencil attachment when the stencil test passes, but the depth test fails.
- [depthStencilPassOperation](depthstencilpassoperation.md): The operation that is performed to update the values in the stencil attachment when both the stencil test and the depth test pass.
- [stencilCompareFunction](stencilcomparefunction.md): The comparison that is performed between the masked reference value and a masked value in the stencil attachment.
- [MTLStencilOperation](../mtlstenciloperation.md): The operation performed on a currently stored stencil value when a comparison test passes or fails.
