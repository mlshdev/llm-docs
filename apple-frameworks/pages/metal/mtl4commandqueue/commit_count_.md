## Discussion

The order in which you sort the command buffers in the array is meaningful, especially when it contains suspending/resuming render passes. A suspending/resuming render pass is a render pass you create by calling [renderCommandEncoderWithDescriptor:options:](../mtl4commandbuffer/makerendercommandencoder%28descriptor_options_%29.md), and provide `MTL4RenderEncoderOptionSuspending` or `MTL4RenderEncoderOptionResuming` for the `options` parameter.

If your command buffers contain suspend/resume render passes, ensure that the first command buffer only suspends, and the last one only resumes. Additionally, make sure that all intermediate command buffers are both suspending and resuming.
