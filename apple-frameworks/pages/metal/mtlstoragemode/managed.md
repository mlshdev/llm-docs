# MTLStorageMode.managed (Swift)

**Framework:** Metal  
**Kind:** Case  
**Availability:** Mac Catalyst 13.0+ (deprecated in 27.0) · macOS 10.11+ (deprecated in 27.0)

The CPU and GPU may maintain separate copies of the resource, and any changes need to be explicitly synchronized.

> Managed storage has no effect on Apple Silicon, use Shared storage instead

## Declaration

```swift
case managed
```

## Discussion

On Intel-based Mac computers, this is the default storage mode for [MTLTexture](../mtltexture.md) objects. In iOS and tvOS, the managed storage mode isn’t available. With managed storage, you synchronize changes between the CPU and GPU manually. For instructions and examples of resource synchronization, see [Synchronizing a managed resource in macOS](../synchronizing-a-managed-resource-in-macos.md).

For more guidance on how to choose storage modes, see [Setting resource storage modes](../setting-resource-storage-modes.md).

### Storage mode options

- [MTLStorageMode.shared](shared.md): The CPU and GPU share access to the resource, allocated in system memory.
- [MTLStorageMode.private](private.md): The resource is only available to the GPU.
- [MTLStorageMode.memoryless](memoryless.md): The resource’s contents are only available to the GPU, and only exist temporarily during a render pass.
