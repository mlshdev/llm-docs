# MTLPrimitiveType.line (Swift)

**Framework:** Metal  
**Kind:** Case  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ · iPadOS 8.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.11+ · tvOS · visionOS 1.0+

Rasterize a line between each separate pair of vertices, resulting in a series of unconnected lines. If there are an odd number of vertices, the last vertex is ignored.

## Declaration

```swift
case line
```

### Geometric primitive types

- [MTLPrimitiveType.point](point.md): Rasterize a point at each vertex. The vertex shader needs to provide `[[point_size]]`, or the point size is undefined.
- [MTLPrimitiveType.lineStrip](linestrip.md): Rasterize a line between each pair of adjacent vertices, resulting in a series of connected lines (also called a polyline).
- [MTLPrimitiveType.triangle](triangle.md): For every separate set of three vertices, rasterize a triangle. If the number of vertices is not a multiple of three, either one or two vertices is ignored.
- [MTLPrimitiveType.triangleStrip](trianglestrip.md): For every three adjacent vertices, rasterize a triangle.
