# neighborsForVector:maximumCount:distanceType:

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** Natural Language  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 13.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 6.0+

Retrieves a limited number of strings near a location in the vocabulary space.

## Declaration

```objectivec
- (NSArray<NSString *> *) neighborsForVector:(NSArray<NSNumber *> *) vector maximumCount:(NSUInteger) maxCount distanceType:(NLDistanceType) distanceType;
```

## Parameters

- `vector`: A location in the vocabulary space.
- `maxCount`: The largest number of neighboring strings that the method can return in an array.
- `distanceType`: A means of calculating distance that determines which formula the method uses to evaluate a neighbor’s distance from `vector`.

## Return Value

An array of tuples that contain neighboring strings and their distances. In Objective-C, this returns an array of neighboring strings.
