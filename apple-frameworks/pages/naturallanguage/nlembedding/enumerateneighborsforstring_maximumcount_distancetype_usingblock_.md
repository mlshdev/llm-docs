# enumerateNeighborsForString:maximumCount:distanceType:usingBlock:

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** Natural Language  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 13.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 6.0+

Passes the nearest strings of a string in the vocabulary to a block.

## Declaration

```objectivec
- (void) enumerateNeighborsForString:(NSString *) string maximumCount:(NSUInteger) maxCount distanceType:(NLDistanceType) distanceType usingBlock:(void (^)(NSString *neighbor, NLDistance distance, BOOL *stop)) block;
```

## Parameters

- `string`: A location in the vocabulary space.
- `maxCount`: The largest number of times the method calls `block`.
- `distanceType`: A means of calculating distance that determines which formula the method uses to evaluate a neighbor’s distance from `string`.
- `block`: A block with the following parameters:

  - **`neighbor`**: A neighboring string.
  - **`distance`**: The distance from `string` to the neighboring string.
  - **`stop`**: A Boolean that indicates whether to stop enumerating neighbors.
