# CTRunGetPositions(\_:\_:\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Text  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** iOS 3.2+ · iPadOS 3.2+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.5+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

Copies a range of glyph positions into a user-provided buffer.

## Declaration

```swift
func CTRunGetPositions(_ run: CTRun, _ range: CFRange, _ buffer: UnsafeMutablePointer<CGPoint>)
```

## Parameters

- `run`: The run from which to copy glyph positions.
- `range`: The range of glyph positions to copy. If the length of the range is set to `0`, then the copy operation will continue from the start index of the range to the end of the run.
- `buffer`: The buffer to which the glyph positions are copied. The buffer must be allocated to at least the value specified by the range’s length.
