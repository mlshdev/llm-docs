# ConditionalComponentStyle

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** Apple News Format  
**Kind:** Object  
**Availability:** Apple News Format 1.9+

The object for defining conditional properties for a component style, and when the conditional properties are in effect.

## Declaration

```
object ConditionalComponentStyle
```

## Properties

- `conditions` — `(Condition | [Condition])` (required): An instance or array of conditions that, when met, cause the conditional component style properties to take effect.
  **Allowed types:** `Condition`, `[Condition]`
- `backgroundColor` — `(Color | string("none"))`: The component’s background color. This value defaults to transparent.

  To remove a previously set condition, use `none`.  
  **Allowed types:** `Color`, `string("none")`
- `border` — `(Border | string("none"))`: The border for the component. Because the border is inside the component, it affects the size of the content within the component. The bigger the border, the less available space for content.

  To remove a previously set condition, use `none`.  
  **Allowed types:** `Border`, `string("none")`
- `fill` — `(Fill | string("none"))`: A fill object, such as an [ImageFill](imagefill.md), that Apple News applies on top of the specified `backgroundColor`.

  By default, Apply News doesn’t   apply any fill.

  To remove a previously set condition, use `none`.  
  **Allowed types:** `Fill`, `string("none")`
- `mask` — `(CornerMask | string("none"))`: A mask that clips the contents of the component to the specified masking behavior.

  To remove a previously set condition, use `none`.  
  **Allowed types:** `CornerMask`, `string("none")`
- `opacity` — `number`: The opacity of the component, set as a `float` value between `0` (completely transparent) and `1` (completely opaque). All child components inherit the effects of the component’s opacity.  See [Nesting Components in an Article](../applenews/nesting-components-in-an-article.md).
  **Default:** `1`
- `tableStyle` — `(TableStyle | string("none"))`: The styling for the rows, columns, and cells of the component, if it’s a [DataTable](datatable.md) or [HTMLTable](htmltable.md) component.

  To remove a previously set condition, use `none`.  
  **Allowed types:** `TableStyle`, `string("none")`
- `shadow` — `ComponentShadow`: The object for creating a component shadow.

## Discussion

Use the `ConditionalComponentStyle` object to define an array of conditional component style properties and the conditions under which to apply them. When a condition is met, the value of a property in `ConditionalComponentStyle` overrides the value of the same property if you define it in the parent `ComponentStyle` object. See [ComponentStyle](componentstyle.md).

### Example

```json
{
  "components": [
    {
      "role": "body",
      "text": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.",
      "style": "exampleStyle"
    }
  ],
  "componentStyles": {
    "exampleStyle": {
      "backgroundColor": "#e3e3e3",
      "conditional": [
        {
          "backgroundColor": "goldenrod",
          "conditions": [
            {
              "verticalSizeClass": "compact"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
