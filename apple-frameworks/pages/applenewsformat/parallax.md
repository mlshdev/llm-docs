# Parallax

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** Apple News Format  
**Kind:** Object  
**Availability:** Apple News Format 1.7+

The behavior whereby a component moves at a speed different from the scroll speed.

## Declaration

```
object Parallax
```

## Properties

- `type` — `string` (required): This behavior always has the type `parallax`.
  **Allowed values:** `parallax`
- `factor` — `number`: The speed of the component, as a factor of the scroll speed. Use a value of factor between `0.5` and `2.0`. Values outside this range are reset to the minimum or maximum value.

  The parallax factor `1.0` is equal to the scroll speed.

  A factor lower than `1.0` makes the component move more slowly than the scrolling speed.

  A factor higher than `1.0` makes the component move more quickly than the scrolling speed.  
  **Default:** `0.9`  
  **Minimum:** `0.5`  
  **Maximum:** `2`

## Discussion

When you apply the `Parallax` behavior to a component, the component moves at a different speed than the scroll speed. Use the `factor` property to set the speed of the component. [This video](https://developer.apple.com/apple-news/videos/parallax.mp4) shows an example of the `parallax` behavior.

> **Tip**

>  When you use parallax behavior, you might notice text becoming illegible as it covers an image. You can fix this easily, and create a cleaner, more legible article, by adding a background color.
