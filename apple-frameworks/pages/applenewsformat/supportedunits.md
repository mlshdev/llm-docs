## Discussion

You can define units for setting dimensions in Apple News Format. If you don’t define the units to use, Apple News Format interprets the dimensions in points (`pt`).

The following are the supported units in Apple News Format:

- `vw`. Defines a size or margin based on the viewport width.
- `vh`. Defines a size or margin based on the viewport height.
- `vmin`. Defines a size or margin based on the shortest side of the viewport (height or width, whichever is shorter).
- `vmax`. Defines a size or margin based on the longest side of the viewport (height or width, whichever is longer).
- `dg`. Defines a size or margin based on the document gutter. See [Layout](layout.md).
- `dm`. Defines a size or margin based on the document margin. See [Layout](layout.md).
- `cw`. Defines a size based on the component’s width. Note that you can only use this unit for sizing the component itself.
- `pw`. Defines the component width based on the parent component width.
- `pt`. Defines a unit of measure in points (the default).
