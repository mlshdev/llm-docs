## Discussion

You can define the following Apple domain links for the `URL` property in [Aside](aside.md), [Chapter](chapter.md), [Container](container.md), [Logo](logo.md), [Image](image.md), and [Section](section.md) objects:

- A link to an Apple News article. Begin each link with `https://apple.news/`. To link within the document, use an anchor link starting with `#`, followed by the component identifier to which you want to link. To link to a component in another article, you must include an Apple News URL with the `#` and component identifier after it; for example, `https://apple.news/A5vHgPPmQSvuIxPjeXLTdGQ#TextComponent-1`.
- A canonical link element associated with an Apple News article by its `canonicalURL` in [Metadata](metadata.md).
- A link to the iTunes Store, the App Store, Apple Books, Apple Music, or Apple Podcasts you create using a [link generator](https://tools.applemediaservices.com/app-store).
- A link to a ticker symbol in the Stocks app, using the URL format `stocks://?symbol=`*ticker symbol*; `f`or example, `stocks://?symbol=AAPL`.
- A link to a hosted calendar, using `webcal://</value>`.
