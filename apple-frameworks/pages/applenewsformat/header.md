# Header

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** Apple News Format  
**Kind:** Object  
**Availability:** Apple News Format 1.7+

The component for defining the top area of an article, chapter, or section.

## Declaration

```
object Header
```

## Properties

- `role` — `string` (required): Always `header` for this component.
  **Allowed values:** `header`
- `additions` — `[ComponentLink]`: An array of `ComponentLink` objects you can use to create a ComponentLink, allowing a link to anywhere in News.

  You can add a link to a [Container](container.md) component to make the entire component tappable. Any links used in its child components are not interactable.
- `allowAutoplacedAds` — `boolean`: A Boolean value that allows the placement of ad banners between components. Nested components inherit the value of the outermost container that explicitly sets `allowAutoplacedAds`. The default value is `true`.
  **Default:** `true`
- `anchor` — `Anchor`: An object that defines vertical alignment with another component.
- `animation` — `(ComponentAnimation | string("none"))`: An object that defines an animation you apply to the component.

  Use the `none` value for conditional design elements. Adding it here has no effect.  
  **Allowed types:** `ComponentAnimation`, `string("none")`
- `behavior` — `(Behavior | string("none"))`: An object that defines behavior for a component, like [Parallax](parallax.md) or [Springy](springy.md).

  The `none` value is used for conditional design elements. Adding it here has no effect.  
  **Allowed types:** `Behavior`, `string("none")`
- `components` — `[Component]`: An array of components to display as child components. Child components are positioned and rendered relative to their parent component.
- `conditional` — `(ConditionalContainer | [ConditionalContainer])`: An instance or array of container properties that can be applied conditionally, and the conditions that cause them to be applied.
  **Allowed types:** `ConditionalContainer`, `[ConditionalContainer]`
- `contentDisplay` — `(CollectionDisplay | HorizontalStackDisplay | string("none"))`: An object that defines how to position child components within this `container` component. A [HorizontalStackDisplay](horizontalstackdisplay.md), for example, allows for displaying child components side by side.

  In versions of News prior to iOS 11, child components are positioned as if `contentDisplay` were not defined.

  The `none` value is used for conditional design elements. Adding it here has no effect.  
  **Allowed types:** `CollectionDisplay`, `HorizontalStackDisplay`, `string("none")`
- `hidden` — `boolean`: A Boolean value that determines whether the component is hidden.
  **Default:** `false`
- `identifier` — `string`: An optional unique identifier for this component. If used, this `identifier` must be unique across the entire document. You will need an `identifier` for your component if you want to anchor other components to it. See [Anchor](anchor.md).
- `layout` — `(ComponentLayout | string)`: An inline `ComponentLayout` object that contains layout information, or a string reference to a `ComponentLayout` object that is defined at the top level of the document.

  If `layout` is not defined, size and position are be based on various factors, such as the device type, the length of the content, and the `role` of this component.  
  **Allowed types:** `ComponentLayout`, `string`
- `style` — `(ComponentStyle | string | string("none"))`: An inline `ComponentStyle` object that defines the appearance of this component, or a string reference to a `ComponentStyle` object that is defined at the top level of the document.

  The `none` value is used for conditional design elements. Adding it here has no effect.  
  **Allowed types:** `ComponentStyle`, `string`, `string("none")`

## Discussion

A header is a structural component used to define the top area of an article or the top part of a [Section](section.md) or [Chapter](chapter.md) component. A header can contain child components—such as a [Title](title.md) or [Heading](heading.md)—and is often used to layer titles and headings over a background image. (You specify the image in the `style` property with an [ImageFill](imagefill.md) style.) The minimum size of a header component is determined by the size of its child components.
