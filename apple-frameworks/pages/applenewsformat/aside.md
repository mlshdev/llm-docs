# Aside

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** Apple News Format  
**Kind:** Object  
**Availability:** Apple News Format 1.7+

The component for setting apart content that is not directly related to the article, such as promotional content.

## Declaration

```
object Aside
```

## Properties

- `role` — `string` (required): Always `aside` for this component.
  **Allowed values:** `aside`
- `additions` — `[ComponentLink]`: An array of `ComponentLink` objects you can use to create a ComponentLink, allowing a link to anywhere in News.

  You can add a link to a [Container](container.md) component to make the entire component tappable. Any links used in its child components are not interactable.
- `allowAutoplacedAds` — `boolean`: A Boolean value that allows the placement of ad banners between components. Nested components inherit the value of the outermost container that explicitly sets `allowAutoplacedAds`. The default value is `false`.
  **Default:** `false`
- `anchor` — `Anchor`: An object that defines vertical alignment with another component.
- `animation` — `(ComponentAnimation | string("none"))`: An object that defines an animation you apply to the component.

  Use the `none` value for conditional design elements. Adding it here has no effect.  
  **Allowed types:** `ComponentAnimation`, `string("none")`
- `behavior` — `(Behavior | string("none"))`: An object that defines behavior for a component, like [Parallax](parallax.md) or [Springy](springy.md).

  The `none` value is used for conditional design elements. Adding it here has no effect.  
  **Allowed types:** `Behavior`, `string("none")`
- `components` — `[Component]`: An array of components to display as child components. Child components are positioned and rendered relative to their parent component.
- `conditional` — `(ConditionalContainer | [ConditionalContainer])`: An instance or array of container properties that can be applied conditionally,  and the conditions that cause Apple News Format to apply them.
  **Allowed types:** `ConditionalContainer`, `[ConditionalContainer]`
- `contentDisplay` — `(CollectionDisplay | HorizontalStackDisplay | string("none"))`: An object that defines how to position child components within this `aside` component. A [HorizontalStackDisplay](horizontalstackdisplay.md), for example, allows for displaying child components side by side.

  In versions of News prior to iOS 11, child components are positioned as if `contentDisplay` were not defined.

  The `none` value is used for conditional design elements. Adding it here has no effect.  
  **Allowed types:** `CollectionDisplay`, `HorizontalStackDisplay`, `string("none")`
- `hidden` — `boolean`: A Boolean value that determines whether the component is hidden.
  **Default:** `false`
- `identifier` — `string`: An optional unique identifier for this component. If used, this `identifier` must be unique across the entire document. You will need an `identifier` for your component if you want to anchor other components to it.
- `layout` — `(ComponentLayout | string)`: An inline `ComponentLayout` object that contains layout information, or a string reference to a `ComponentLayout` object that is defined at the top level of the document.

  If `layout` is not defined, size and position are based on various factors, such as the device type, the length of the content, and the `role` of this component.  
  **Allowed types:** `ComponentLayout`, `string`
- `style` — `(ComponentStyle | string | string("none"))`: An inline `ComponentStyle` object that defines the appearance of this component, or a string reference to a `ComponentStyle` object that is defined at the top level of the document.

  The `none` value is used for conditional design elements. Adding it here has no effect.  
  **Allowed types:** `ComponentStyle`, `string`, `string("none")`

## Discussion

Use an `aside` component to hold information not directly related to your article. Use an `aside` to help Siri make the most informed content recommendations to people using Apple News and to provide better accuracy for placing your content within feeds, such as the Today feed, channel feeds, and topic feeds.

When News recommends content, it ignores any content in the `aside` component, so you can put content there that is not directly related to the article, such as promotional content, links to other articles, or author biographies.
