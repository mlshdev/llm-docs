# ReplicaAdvertisement

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** Apple News Format  
**Kind:** Object  
**Availability:** Apple News Format 1.9.1+

The component for delivering digital versions of print advertisements.

## Declaration

```
object ReplicaAdvertisement
```

## Properties

- `role` — `string` (required): Always `replica_advertisement` for this component.
  **Allowed values:** `replica_advertisement`
- `URL` — `uri` (required): The URL of the digital version of the print advertisement.

  The URL can begin with `http://`, `https://`, or `bundle://`. If it begins with `bundle://`, the digital version of the print advertisement file must be in the same directory as the document.

  Encode image filenames as `URLs`.

  Digital version of the print advertisement filenames should be properly encoded as URLs.

  See [Preparing Image, Video, Audio, Music, and ARKit Assets](../applenews/preparing-image-video-audio-music-and-arkit-assets.md).
- `accessibilityCaption` — `string`: A caption that describes the image.  VoiceOver uses this text. For more information about VoiceOver, see the [Vision](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/vision/) page in Accessibility. If you don’t provide `accessibilityCaption`, VoiceOver uses the `caption` value.
- `additions` — `[ComponentLink]`: An array of `ComponentLink` objects you can use to create a `ComponentLink`, allowing a link to anywhere in News.
- `anchor` — `Anchor`: An object that defines vertical alignment with another component.
- `animation` — `(ComponentAnimation | string("none"))`: An object that defines an animation you apply to the component.

  Use the `none` value for conditional design elements. Adding it here has no effect.  
  **Allowed types:** `ComponentAnimation`, `string("none")`
- `behavior` — `(Behavior | string("none"))`: An object that defines behavior for a component, like [Parallax](parallax.md) or [Springy](springy.md).

  Use the `none` value for conditional design elements. Adding it here has no effect.  
  **Allowed types:** `Behavior`, `string("none")`
- `caption` — `(CaptionDescriptor | string)`: A caption that describes the digital version of the print advertisement. The article displays this text when the digital version of the print advertisement is full screen, and VoiceOver uses this text if you don’t provide `accessibilityCaption` text. For more information about VoiceOver, see the [Vision](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/vision/) page in Accessibility. The caption text doesn’t appear in the main article view. To display a caption in the main article view, use the [Caption](caption.md) component.
  **Allowed types:** `CaptionDescriptor`, `string`
- `conditional` — `(ConditionalComponent | [ConditionalComponent])`: An instance or array of component properties that you can apply conditionally, and the conditions that cause Apple News Format to apply them.
  **Allowed types:** `ConditionalComponent`, `[ConditionalComponent]`
- `explicitContent` — `boolean`: A Boolean value that indicates the digital version of the print advertisement may contain explicit content.
- `hidden` — `boolean`: A Boolean value that determines whether the component is hidden.
  **Default:** `false`
- `identifier` — `string`: An optional unique identifier for this component. If you use     `identifier`, it must be unique across the entire document. You need an `identifier` for your component if you want to anchor other components to it.
- `layout` — `(ComponentLayout | string)`: An inline `ComponentLayout` object that contains layout information, or a string reference to a `ComponentLayout` object that is defined at the top level of the document.

  If you don’t define `layout`, size and position are based on various factors, such as the device type, the length of the content, and the `role` of this component.  
  **Allowed types:** `ComponentLayout`, `string`
- `style` — `(ComponentStyle | string | string("none"))`: An inline `ComponentStyle` object that defines the appearance of this component, or a string reference to a `ComponentStyle` object that you define at the top level of the document.

  Use the `none` value for conditional design elements. Adding it here has no effect.  
  **Allowed types:** `ComponentStyle`, `string`, `string("none")`
