# GalleryItem

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** Apple News Format  
**Kind:** Object  
**Availability:** Apple News Format 1.7+

An object used in a gallery or mosaic component for displaying an individual image.

## Declaration

```
object GalleryItem
```

## Properties

- `URL` — `uri` (required): The `URL` of an image to display in a gallery or mosaic.

  Image URLs can begin with `http://`, `https://`, or `bundle://`. If the image URL begins with `bundle://`, the image file must be in the same directory as the document.

  Encode image filenames as `URLs`.

  See [Preparing Image, Video, Audio, Music, and ARKit Assets](../applenews/preparing-image-video-audio-music-and-arkit-assets.md).
- `accessibilityCaption` — `string`: A caption that describes the image. The text is used for VoiceOver. For more information about VoiceOver, see the [Vision](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/vision/) page in Accessibility. If you don’t provide `accessibilityCaption`, VoiceOver uses the `caption` value.
- `caption` — `(CaptionDescriptor | string)`: A caption that describes the image. The article displays this text when the image is full screen, and VoiceOver uses this text if you don’t provide `accessibilityCaption` text. For more information about VoiceOver, see the [Vision](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/vision/) page in Accessibility. The caption text doesn’t appear in the main article view. To display a caption in the main article view, use the [Caption](caption.md) component.
  **Allowed types:** `CaptionDescriptor`, `string`
- `explicitContent` — `boolean`: A Boolean value that indicates the image may contain explicit content.

## Discussion

Use an array of `GalleryItem` objects to define the individual items used in a gallery or mosaic component. When the user taps an image in a gallery or mosaic to see it full-screen (as shown in the following figure), the caption from the caption descriptor property is shown. Note that this is different from the [Caption](caption.md) component.

This object can be used in [Gallery](gallery.md) and [Mosaic](mosaic.md).
