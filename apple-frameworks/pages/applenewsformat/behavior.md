# Behavior

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** Apple News Format  
**Kind:** Object  
**Availability:** Apple News Format 1.7+

Properties shared by all the behaviors you can use to affect how components react to device motion and scrolling.

## Declaration

```
object Behavior
```

## Properties

- `type` — `string` (required): The type of behavior; for example, parallax for a Parallax behavior.
  **Allowed values:** `background_motion`, `background_parallax`, `motion`, `parallax`, `springy`

## Discussion

A behavior defines the physics of a component and its context. The effect of a component behavior is persistent and occurs every time a person views the article. Compare that with an animation which happens just once each time a person views the component in your article.

> **Note**

>  You don’t use the `Behavior` object directly; instead, use the specific objects that extend it.

You can use this object in [Component](component.md).
