# Photo

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** Apple News Format  
**Kind:** Object  
**Availability:** Apple News Format 1.7+

The component for including a photograph.

## Declaration

```
object Photo
```

## Properties

- `URL` — `uri` (required): The URL of an image file.

  Image URLs can begin with `http://`, `https://`, or `bundle://`. If the image URL begins with `bundle://`, the image file must be in the same directory as the document.

  Encode image filenames as URLs.

  See [Preparing Image, Video, Audio, Music, and ARKit Assets](../applenews/preparing-image-video-audio-music-and-arkit-assets.md).
- `role` — `string` (required): Always `photo` for this component.
  **Allowed values:** `photo`
- `accessibilityCaption` — `string`: A caption that describes the photo.  VoiceOver uses this text. For more information about VoiceOver, see the [Vision](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/vision/) page in Accessibility. If you don’t provide `accessibilityCaption`, VoiceOver uses the `caption` value.
- `additions` — `[ComponentLink]`: An array of `ComponentLink` objects you can use to create a `ComponentLink`, allowing a link to anywhere in News.
- `anchor` — `Anchor`: An object that defines vertical alignment with another component.
- `animation` — `(ComponentAnimation | string("none"))`: An object that defines an animation you apply to the component.

  Use the `none` value for conditional design elements. Adding it here has no effect.  
  **Allowed types:** `ComponentAnimation`, `string("none")`
- `behavior` — `(Behavior | string("none"))`: An object that defines behavior for a component, like [Parallax](parallax.md) or [Springy](springy.md).

  Use the `none` value for conditional design elements. Adding it here has no effect.  
  **Allowed types:** `Behavior`, `string("none")`
- `caption` — `(CaptionDescriptor | string)`: A caption that describes the image. The article displays this text when the image is full screen, and VoiceOver uses this text if you don’t provide `accessibilityCaption` text. For more information about VoiceOver, see the [Vision](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/vision/) page in Accessibility. The caption text doesn’t appear in the main article view. To display a caption in the main article view, use the [Caption](caption.md) component.
  **Allowed types:** `CaptionDescriptor`, `string`
- `conditional` — `(ConditionalComponent | [ConditionalComponent])`: An instance or array of component properties that you can apply conditionally, and the conditions that cause Apple News Format to apply them.
  **Allowed types:** `ConditionalComponent`, `[ConditionalComponent]`
- `explicitContent` — `boolean`: A Boolean value that indicates the image may contain explicit content.
- `hidden` — `boolean`: A Boolean value that determines whether the component is hidden.
  **Default:** `false`
- `identifier` — `string`: An optional unique identifier for this component. If you use     `identifier`, it must be unique across the entire document. You need an `identifier` for your component if you want to anchor other components to it.
- `layout` — `(ComponentLayout | string)`: An inline `ComponentLayout` object that contains layout information, or a string reference to a `ComponentLayout` object that you define at the top level of the document.

  If you don’t define `layout`, size and position are based on various factors, such as the device type, the length of the content, and the `role` of this component.  
  **Allowed types:** `ComponentLayout`, `string`
- `style` — `(ComponentStyle | string | string("none"))`: An inline `ComponentStyle` object that defines the appearance of this component, or a string reference to a `ComponentStyle` object that you define at the top level of the document.

  Use the `none` value for conditional design elements. Adding it here has no effect.  
  **Allowed types:** `ComponentStyle`, `string`, `string("none")`

## Discussion

Use the `photo` component to display a photograph in an article. A `photo` component is optimized for displaying photographs. Other components are available for other types of images, such as [Figure](figure.md), [Portrait](portrait.md), and [Logo](logo.md).

See [Preparing Image, Video, Audio, Music, and ARKit Assets](../applenews/preparing-image-video-audio-music-and-arkit-assets.md).
