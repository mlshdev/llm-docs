# Horizontal text (Swift)

**Framework:** Accessibility  
**Kind:** API Collection

Lay out vertical text horizontally in your app when people turn on the Prefer Horizontal Text setting.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

People use the Prefer Horizontal Text setting to specify a preference for laying out text horizontally in languages that support vertical text. By default, the setting is off, which allows languages that support vertical text to lay out text vertically. A person can turn on the setting to indicate that they prefer a horizontal text layout where possible.

In your app, handle changes to the Prefer Horizontal Text setting to create an enjoyable experience for people who choose to opt in to a horizontal text layout. Register for the notification [prefersHorizontalTextLayoutDidChangeNotification](accessibilitysettings/prefershorizontaltextlayoutdidchangenotification.md) to respond to changes in this setting:

```swift
import Accessibility

NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self,
    selector: #selector(prefersHorizontalTextChanged),
    name: NSNotification.Name.prefersHorizontalTextLayoutDidChangeNotification,
    object: nil)
```

When the Prefer Horizontal Text setting changes, perform changes to your UI to update how you lay out text:

```swift
@objc 
func prefersHorizontalTextChanged(_ notification: Notification) {
    if AccessibilitySettings.prefersHorizontalTextLayout {
        // The setting is on. Use a horizontal layout for text where possible.
    } else {
        // The setting is off. Use a vertical layout for languages that support vertical text.
    }
}
```

Check the value of the Prefer Horizontal Text setting at any time by using [prefersHorizontalTextLayout](accessibilitysettings/prefershorizontaltextlayout.md).
