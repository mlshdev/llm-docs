## Discussion

Some app behaviors depend on a person turning on a specific Accessibility setting on their device. You can use this method to open the Settings app to a specific Accessibility setting to help people turn it on more quickly, as shown in the following code example.

```swift
ContentView()
    .alert(
        "Use Personal Voice",
        isPresented: $showAlert
    ) {
        Button("Open Accessibility Settings") {
            Task {
                do {
                    try await AccessibilitySettings.openSettings(for: .personalVoiceAllowAppsToRequestToUse)
                } catch {
                    print("Error: \(error)")
                }
            }
        }
        Button("Cancel", role: .cancel) { }
    } message: {
        Text("To use this feature, turn on the Personal Voice > Allow Apps to Request to Use setting.")
    }
```
