## Overview

Accessibility notifications provide a unified, multiplatform way for your app to convey information to someone using an assistive app. Your app can post these types of notifications:

- *Announcement* to convey an announcement to an assistive app
- *Layout change* to indicate when the layout of a screen changes
- *Screen change* to indicate when a new view appears that occupies a major portion of the screen
- *Page scroll* to indicate when a scroll action completes

For announcement notifications, you can set a priority to specify the announcement’s importance relative to other announcements that are in the queue for an assistive app to speak. For more information, see [AccessibilityNotification.Announcement](accessibilitynotification/announcement.md).
