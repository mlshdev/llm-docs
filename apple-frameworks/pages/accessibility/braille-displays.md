## Overview

A refreshable braille display is a hardware device that shows rows of pins that can raise and lower. People who are blind or deafblind use these devices to read digital content through interaction with a screenreader, such as VoiceOver. For information about connecting a braille display to an Apple device, read [Use a braille display with VoiceOver on iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/use-a-braille-display-iph73b8c43/ios).

A two-dimensional refreshable braille display has a grid of evenly spaced pins that you can use to represent images, charts, and other visual data to VoiceOver users so they can experience your content through touch.
