# latestTransaction

**Framework:** StoreKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 15.0+ · iPadOS 15.0+ · Mac Catalyst 15.0+ · macOS 12.0+ · tvOS 15.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 8.0+

The most recent transaction for the product.

## Declaration

```swift
var latestTransaction: VerificationResult<Transaction>? { get async }
```

## Discussion

This value is `nil` if the customer has never purchased this product. The following code example illustrates requesting the most recent transaction for a product to determine whether the customer has purchased the product:

```swift
guard let resultingTransaction = await product.latestTransaction else {
    // The customer hasn't purchased this product.
    return
}
guard case .verified(let transaction) = resultingTransaction else {
    // Ignore unverified transactions.
    return
}
// Update your app based on the details from the most recent transaction.
```

By default, when the [SKIncludeConsumableInAppPurchaseHistory](../../bundleresources/information-property-list/skincludeconsumableinapppurchasehistory.md) property list key is `false`, this value excludes finished consumable in-app purchases unless they are refunded or revoked.

If you set the [SKIncludeConsumableInAppPurchaseHistory](../../bundleresources/information-property-list/skincludeconsumableinapppurchasehistory.md) property list key to `true`, this value returns all transactions, including consumable in-app purchases that your app marked as finished ([finish()](../transaction/finish%28%29.md)).
