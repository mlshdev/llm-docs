## Discussion

If you offer multiple auto-renewable subscriptions with different price tiers, you can assign each to a level in App Store Connect. Ranking your subscriptions determines the upgrade, downgrade, and crossgrade paths available.

Subscriptions with the highest level of service within a subscription group have a [groupLevel](grouplevel.md) value of `1`. Subscriptions with lower levels of service or content have [groupLevel](grouplevel.md) values of `2` or greater. For example, when comparing two subscriptions, moving from a subscription with a [groupLevel](grouplevel.md) of `2` to a subscription with a [groupLevel](grouplevel.md) of `1` represents an upgrade.

For more information on ranking, see [Ranking subscriptions within the group](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/subscriptions/#ranking). For information on assigning subscription levels in App Store Connect, see [Assign subscription levels](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-subscriptions/offer-auto-renewable-subscriptions/#assign-subscription-levels).

> **Note**

>  On systems earlier than iOS 17, macOS 14, tvOS 17, and watchOS 10, this property returns a sentinel value of `0` when you test your app using StoreKit Testing in Xcode or if there’s an unexpected server error.
