## Discussion

StoreKit provides several APIs you can use to enable customers to initiate a purchase. Before using [purchase(options:)](purchase%28options_%29.md) consider the following APIs and choose the one that best suits your app’s implementation:

- Use [PurchaseAction](../purchaseaction.md) for apps that use [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui) on any platform, including multi-scene apps for visionOS.
- Use [purchase(confirmIn:options:)](purchase%28confirmin_options_%29-6dj6y.md) for apps that use [UIKit](../../uikit.md).
- Use [purchase(confirmIn:options:)](purchase%28confirmin_options_%29-8eai6.md) for apps that run on macOS and use [AppKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit).
- Use [purchase(options:)](purchase%28options_%29.md) for apps that runs on watchOS.

> **Important**

>  If you use StoreKit views such as [ProductView](../productview.md), [StoreView](../storeview.md), or [SubscriptionStoreView](../subscriptionstoreview.md) you don’t need to call any other API to initiate a purchase. StoreKit manages the purchase action automatically, including presenting the purchase confirmation UI. For more information, see [StoreKit views](../storekit-views.md).

### Use the purchase API

Call the [purchase(options:)](purchase%28options_%29.md) method when a customer initiates a purchase, either within your app or after selecting a promoted in-app purchase on the App Store. This method brings up the system-confirmation sheet. The user can confirm to complete the transaction or cancel it.

Include the purchase options to provide additional information about the purchase, such as:

- [appAccountToken(\_:)](purchaseoption/appaccounttoken%28__%29.md) to associate the purchase with the resulting transaction
- [promotionalOffer(offerID:keyID:nonce:signature:timestamp:)](purchaseoption/promotionaloffer%28offerid_keyid_nonce_signature_timestamp_%29.md), if the customer is redeeming a promotional offer for an auto-renewable subscription
- [quantity(\_:)](purchaseoption/quantity%28__%29.md), if the customer is purchasing more than one of the product

The following example illustrates calling [purchase(options:)](purchase%28options_%29.md) using the `options` parameter to provide an app account token:

```swift
let appAccountToken = <# Generate an app account token. #>
let purchaseResult = try await product.purchase(options: [
    .appAccountToken(appAccountToken)
])
```

If you’re testing your app in the sandbox environment, test an Ask to Buy scenario by setting the [simulatesAskToBuyInSandbox(\_:)](purchaseoption/simulatesasktobuyinsandbox%28__%29.md) purchase option to `true`. For more information about Ask to Buy, see [Approve what kids buy with Ask to Buy](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201089).

This method may throw a [Product.PurchaseError](purchaseerror.md) or [StoreKitError](../storekiterror.md).

For more information about purchases that users initiate on the App Store, see [Promoting In-App Purchases](../promoting-in-app-purchases.md).
