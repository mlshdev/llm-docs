## Discussion

This asynchronous array returns a list of [Product.PromotionInfo](../promotioninfo.md) objects in the custom order they appear in on the device.

> **Note**

>  This list is empty if you don’t override the order, and the App Store displays the products in their default order.

For information about setting the default order using App Store Connect, see [Promote Apple In-App Purchases](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/configure-in-app-purchase-settings/promote-in-app-purchases).
