## Overview

Use the visibility states to set the [visibility](visibility-swift.property.md) of a promoted in-app purchase. Call [update()](update%28%29.md) to save your changes.

The visibility states have the following effects on the user’s device:

- [Product.PromotionInfo.Visibility.visible](visibility-swift.enum/visible.md) makes the promoted Apple In-App Purchase visible in the App Store.
- [Product.PromotionInfo.Visibility.hidden](visibility-swift.enum/hidden.md) hides the promoted Apple In-App Purchase in the App Store.
- [Product.PromotionInfo.Visibility.appStoreConnectDefault](visibility-swift.enum/appstoreconnectdefault.md) let’s you control the visibility using settings in App Store Connect. For more information, see [Promote Apple In-App Purchases](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/configure-in-app-purchase-settings/promote-in-app-purchases).
