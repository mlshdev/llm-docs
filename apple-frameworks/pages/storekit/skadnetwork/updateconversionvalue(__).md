# updateConversionValue(\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** StoreKit  
**Kind:** Type Method  
**Availability:** iOS 14.0+ (deprecated in 15.4) · iPadOS 14.0+ (deprecated in 15.4) · Mac Catalyst 14.0+ (deprecated in 15.4)

Updates the conversion value and verifies the first launch of an app installed as a result of an ad.

> Use [updatePostbackConversionValue(\_:coarseValue:lockWindow:completionHandler:)](updatepostbackconversionvalue%28__coarsevalue_lockwindow_completionhandler_%29.md) instead.

## Declaration

```swift
class func updateConversionValue(_ conversionValue: Int)
```

## Parameters

- `conversionValue`: An unsigned 6-bit value (`>=0` and `<=63`). The app or the ad network determines the meaning of the value. The default value is `0`.

## Mentioned In

## Discussion

Apps that ad networks advertise call [updateConversionValue(\_:)](updateconversionvalue%28__%29.md) or [registerAppForAdNetworkAttribution()](registerappforadnetworkattribution%28%29.md) when the app first launches, to register the attribution.

> **Important**

>  Provide a valid conversion value within the range of `>=0` and `<=63` when calling [updateConversionValue(\_:)](updateconversionvalue%28__%29.md) to register the attribution. Invalid conversion values cause the method to fail, and the conversion to fail to register.

Apps may call [updateConversionValue(\_:)](updateconversionvalue%28__%29.md) again within a rolling 24-hour period to update the conversion value. Calling this method serves two purposes:

- It registers the attribution by generating an install notification — the cryptographically signed data that confirms that a user installed and launched this app as a result of an ad.
- It enables the app to provide and update a conversion value.

Conversion values are a 6-bit value that the ad network or the app defines. The app decides when to update the value, which it can do any number of times before a rolling 24-hour timer expires. The 24-hour timer restarts each time the app calls this method with a valid conversion value greater than the previous value. When the timer expires, the conversion value is final and subsequent calls to [updateConversionValue(\_:)](updateconversionvalue%28__%29.md) have no effect.

The device sends the install notification postback to the ad network’s URL within 0-24 hours after the timer expires. The postback only contains the final conversion value if sending the data meets Apple’s privacy threshold. Only postbacks with an ad attribution can contain a conversion value; non-winning postbacks don’t include a conversion value. For more information, see [Receiving ad attributions and postbacks](../receiving-ad-attributions-and-postbacks.md).

Ad networks must verify the postback after receiving it. See [Verifying an install-validation postback](../verifying-an-install-validation-postback.md) for more information.
