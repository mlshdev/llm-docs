# Managing Price Increases for Auto-Renewable Subscriptions (Swift)

**Framework:** StoreKit  
**Kind:** Article

Identify the price increase status for auto-renewable subscriptions in your app and on your server.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

If you increase the price of an auto-renewable subscription in App Store Connect, the [priceIncreaseStatus](product/subscriptioninfo/renewalinfo/priceincreasestatus-swift.property.md) in the [renewalInfo](product/subscriptioninfo/status-swift.struct/renewalinfo.md) object indicates if the subscription is subject to the price increase. Auto-renewable subscriptions have two types of price increases: those that require customer consent, and those that don’t require customer consent.

For price increases that require customer consent, look for the following status values in your app:

| [Product.SubscriptionInfo.RenewalInfo.PriceIncreaseStatus.noIncreasePending](product/subscriptioninfo/renewalinfo/priceincreasestatus-swift.enum/noincreasepending.md) | Indicates there’s no price increase for this auto-renewable subscription. |
| --- | --- |
| [Product.SubscriptionInfo.RenewalInfo.PriceIncreaseStatus.pending](product/subscriptioninfo/renewalinfo/priceincreasestatus-swift.enum/pending.md) | Indicates there’s a pending price increase for the auto-renewable subscription that requires customer consent, and the customer hasn’t yet consented.  ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.storekit/spacer.png) If the customer doesn’t consent, the auto-renewable subscription expires at the end of the billing cycle. When it expires, your app gets a status update in [updates](product/subscriptioninfo/status-swift.struct/updates.md) with an [expirationReason](product/subscriptioninfo/renewalinfo/expirationreason-swift.property.md) of [didNotConsentToPriceIncrease](product/subscriptioninfo/renewalinfo/expirationreason-swift.struct/didnotconsenttopriceincrease.md). |
| [Product.SubscriptionInfo.RenewalInfo.PriceIncreaseStatus.agreed](product/subscriptioninfo/renewalinfo/priceincreasestatus-swift.enum/agreed.md) | Indicates that the customer consented to a price increase for the auto-renewable subscription. |

For price increases that don’t require customer consent, look for the following status values in your app:

| [Product.SubscriptionInfo.RenewalInfo.PriceIncreaseStatus.noIncreasePending](product/subscriptioninfo/renewalinfo/priceincreasestatus-swift.enum/noincreasepending.md) | Doesn’t apply. |
| --- | --- |
| [Product.SubscriptionInfo.RenewalInfo.PriceIncreaseStatus.pending](product/subscriptioninfo/renewalinfo/priceincreasestatus-swift.enum/pending.md) | Doesn’t apply. |
| [Product.SubscriptionInfo.RenewalInfo.PriceIncreaseStatus.agreed](product/subscriptioninfo/renewalinfo/priceincreasestatus-swift.enum/agreed.md) | Indicates that the App Store informed the customer of the price increase for the auto-renewable subscription, and the subscription is subject to the price increase. ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.storekit/spacer.png) If the customer cancels the auto-renewable subscription, your app gets a status update in [updates](product/subscriptioninfo/status-swift.struct/updates.md) with an [expirationReason](product/subscriptioninfo/renewalinfo/expirationreason-swift.property.md) of [autoRenewDisabled](product/subscriptioninfo/renewalinfo/expirationreason-swift.struct/autorenewdisabled.md). |

### Receive Notifications for Price Increase Status Events

If you’ve enabled [App Store Server Notifications V2](../appstoreservernotifications/app-store-server-notifications-v2.md), your server receives notifications for events related to auto-renewable subscription price increases.

For auto-renewable subscription price increases that require customer consent, look for the following notifications:

| Notification type | Subtype | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PRICE_INCREASE` ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.storekit/spacer.png) | `PENDING` | Indicates that the App Store informed the customer of the price increase for the auto-renewable subscription, and the customer hasn’t yet responded. |
| `PRICE_INCREASE` | `ACCEPTED` | Indicates that the customer consented to the price increase for the auto-renewable subscription. |
| `EXPIRED` | `PRICE_INCREASE` | Indicates that the auto-renewable subscription expired because the customer didn’t consent to the price increase, and allowed the subscription to expire. |
| `EXPIRED` | `VOLUNTARY` | Indicates that the customer voluntarily canceled the auto-renewable subscription. (Note: This notification type and subtype isn’t specific to price increases.) |

For auto-renewable subscription price increases that don’t require customer consent, look for the following notifications:

| Notification type | Subtype | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PRICE_INCREASE` | `ACCEPTED` | Indicates that the App Store informed the customer of the auto-renewable subscription price increase, and the subscription is subject to the price increase. |
| `EXPIRED` | `VOLUNTARY` | Indicates that the customer voluntarily canceled the auto-renewable subscription. (Note: This notification type and subtype isn’t specific to price increases.) |

If you increase the price of an auto-renewable subscription in App Store Connect, the [priceIncreaseStatus](product/subscriptioninfo/renewalinfo/priceincreasestatus-swift.property.md) in the [renewalInfo](product/subscriptioninfo/status-swift.struct/renewalinfo.md) object indicates if the subscription is subject to the price increase. Auto-renewable subscriptions have two types of price increases: those that require customer consent, and those that don’t require customer consent.

For price increases that require customer consent, look for the following status values in your app:

When it expires, your app gets a status update in [updates](product/subscriptioninfo/status-swift.struct/updates.md) with an [expirationReason](product/subscriptioninfo/renewalinfo/expirationreason-swift.property.md) of [didNotConsentToPriceIncrease](product/subscriptioninfo/renewalinfo/expirationreason-swift.struct/didnotconsenttopriceincrease.md). |
| [Product.SubscriptionInfo.RenewalInfo.PriceIncreaseStatus.agreed](product/subscriptioninfo/renewalinfo/priceincreasestatus-swift.enum/agreed.md) | Indicates that the customer consented to a price increase for the auto-renewable subscription. |

For price increases that don’t require customer consent, look for the following status values in your app:
