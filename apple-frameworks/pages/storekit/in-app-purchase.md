# Apple In-App Purchase (Swift)

**Framework:** StoreKit  
**Kind:** API Collection

Offer content and services in your app across Apple platforms using a Swift-based interface.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

With the Apple In-App Purchase API, you can offer customers the opportunity to purchase digital content and services in your app. Customers can make the purchases within your app, and find your promoted products on the App Store.

The StoreKit framework connects to the App Store on your app’s behalf to prompt for, and securely process, payments. The framework then notifies your app, making the transactions for Apple In-App Purchases available to your app on all of the customer’s devices. For each transaction that represents a current purchase, your app delivers the purchased products. To validate purchases, you can verify transactions on your server, or rely on StoreKit’s verification.

![A diagram of the interactions between StoreKit, your app, the App Store, and your server that occur during a transaction.](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.storekit/media-4447232@2x.png)

The App Store can also communicate with your server. It notifies your server of transactions and auto-renewable subscription events through [App Store Server Notifications](../appstoreservernotifications.md), and provides the same transaction information, and more, through the [App Store Server API](../appstoreserverapi.md).

To learn how adding Apple In-App Purchases fits in an overall app development workflow for the App Store, see [App Store Pathway](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/pathway/). For an overview of Apple In-App Purchases and its features, including its configuration, testing capabilities, marketing for your products, and more, see [Simple and safe Apple In-App Purchases](https://developer.apple.com/in-app-purchase/). For an overview on subscriptions, including creating subscription groups, Family Sharing, and more, see [Auto-renewable subscriptions](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/subscriptions/).

### Configure Apple In-App Purchases

To use the Apple In-App Purchase API, you first need to configure the products that your app merchandises.

- In the early stages of development, you can configure the products in the StoreKit configuration file in Xcode, and test your code without any dependency on App Store Connect. For more information, see [Setting up StoreKit Testing in Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/setting-up-storekit-testing-in-xcode).
- When you’re ready for sandbox testing and production, configure the products in App Store Connect. You can add or remove products and refine or reconfigure existing products as you develop your app. For more information, see [Configure Apple In-App Purchase settings](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/configure-in-app-purchase-settings/overview-for-configuring-in-app-purchases).

You can also offer apps and Apple In-App Purchases that run on multiple platforms as a single purchase. For more information on universal purchase, see [Add platforms](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/create-an-app-record/add-platforms/).

### Support a store in your app

The Apple In-App Purchase API takes advantage of Swift features like concurrency to simplify your Apple In-App Purchase workflows, and SwiftUI to build stores with [StoreKit views](storekit-views.md). Use the API to manage access to content and subscriptions, receive App Store-signed transaction information, get the history of all Apple In-App Purchase transactions, and more.

>  Session 10114: [Meet StoreKit 2](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10114/)

The Apple In-App Purchase API offers:

- Transaction information that’s App Store-signed in JSON Web Signature (JWS) format.
- Transaction and subscription status information that’s simple to parse in your app.
- An entitlements API, [currentEntitlements](transaction/currententitlements.md), that simplifies determining entitlements to unlock content and services for your customers.

>  Session 110404: [Implement proactive Apple In-App Purchase restore](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/110404/)

To support a store in your app, implement the following functionality:

- Listen for transaction state changes using the transaction listener, [updates](transaction/updates.md), to provide up-to-date service and content while your app is running.
- Use [StoreKit views](storekit-views.md) to merchandise your products; or request products to display from the App Store with [products(for:)](product/products%28for_%29.md) and enable purchases using [purchase(options:)](product/purchase%28options_%29.md). Unlock purchased content and services based on the purchase result, [Product.PurchaseResult](product/purchaseresult.md).
- Iterate through a customer’s purchases anytime using the transaction sequence [all](transaction/all.md), and unlock the purchased content and services.
- Optionally, validate the signed transactions and signed subscription status information that you receive from the API.
