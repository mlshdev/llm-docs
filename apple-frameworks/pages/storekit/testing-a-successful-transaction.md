# Testing a successful transaction (Swift)

**Framework:** StoreKit  
**Kind:** Article

Confirm that your app can make a successful transaction in the sandbox environment by inspecting the transaction.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Set a breakpoint in your implementation of the transaction queue observer’s [paymentQueue(\_:updatedTransactions:)](skpaymenttransactionobserver/paymentqueue%28__updatedtransactions_%29.md) method. Then sign in to the App Store with a Sandbox Apple Account, and make a purchase in your app. Inspect the transaction to verify that its status is [SKPaymentTransactionState.purchased](skpaymenttransactionstate/purchased.md).

Set a breakpoint at the point in your code where your app stores the purchase, and confirm that your code saves the data in response to a successful purchase. Inspect the user default or iCloud key-value store, to verify that your code correctly records the information. For more information on saving data in response to a successful purchase, see [Persisting a purchase](persisting-a-purchase.md).
