## Overview

A *transaction* represents a successful In-App Purchase. The App Store generates a transaction each time a customer purchases an In-App Purchase product or renews a subscription. For each transaction that represents a current purchase, your app unlocks the purchased content or service and finishes the transaction.

Use the `Transaction` type to perform these transaction-related tasks:

- Get the customer’s transaction history, latest transactions, and current entitlements to unlock content and services.
- Access transaction properties.
- Finish a transaction after your app delivers the purchased content or service.
- Access the raw JSON Web Signature (JWS) string and supporting values to verify the transaction information.
- Listen for new transactions while the app is running.
- Begin a refund request from within your app.

### Access transaction history and current entitlements

Your app doesn’t create transaction objects. Instead, StoreKit automatically makes up-to-date transactions available to your app, including when someone launches the app for the first time.

>  Session 110404: [Implement proactive in-app purchase restore](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/110404/)

You access transactions in several ways:

- Get transaction history anytime by accessing the static [all](transaction/all.md) sequence, or get just the most recent transaction for a product with the [latestTransaction](product/latesttransaction.md) property of [Product](product.md).
- Receive notifications for new transactions while your app is running when customers complete a purchase outside of the app, including on another device, through the transaction listener, [updates](transaction/updates.md).
- Access the latest transaction for a subscription group through the subscription status API, using [transaction](product/subscriptioninfo/status-swift.struct/transaction.md).
- After a successful In-App Purchase, StoreKit returns the transaction through [Product.PurchaseResult.success(\_:)](product/purchaseresult/success%28__%29.md).

The most important use of transaction information is for determining which In-App Purchases the customer has paid access to, so your app can unlock the content or service. The [currentEntitlements](transaction/currententitlements.md) API provides the information you need to unlock all of the customer’s paid content in your app. Use `currentEntitlements` to get a list of transactions for all the products the customer is currently entitled to, including non-consumable In-App Purchases and currently active subscriptions.

<a id="Verify-transactions"></a>

### Verify transactions

The App Store cryptographically signs transaction information in JWS format. StoreKit automatically validates and returns the signed information, wrapped in a [VerificationResult](verificationresult.md). When the `VerificationResult` wraps a `Transaction` value, it provides the raw JWS string in the [jwsRepresentation](verificationresult/jwsrepresentation-21vgo.md) property. If you get a transaction through [VerificationResult.verified(\_:)](verificationresult/verified%28__%29.md), the information passed validation. If you get it through [VerificationResult.unverified(\_:\_:)](verificationresult/unverified%28____%29.md), the information didn’t pass StoreKit’s automatic validation. Your app can immediately access the transaction information in the [Transaction properties](transaction-properties.md).

To perform your own validation on the device, use the verification result’s [jwsRepresentation](verificationresult/jwsrepresentation-21vgo.md) string, and use the provided convenience properties [headerData](verificationresult/headerdata-9egfp.md), [payloadData](verificationresult/payloaddata-uyle.md), and [signatureData](verificationresult/signaturedata-4pyv8.md). For added control and security, send the `jwsRepresentation` to your server to verify. Consider using the App Store Server Library to implement your verification. The library provides the functions `verifyAndDecodeTransaction` and `verifyAndDecodeRenewalInfo` in each language the library supports. For more information, see [Simplifying your implementation by using the App Store Server Library](../appstoreserverapi/simplifying-your-implementation-by-using-the-app-store-server-library.md).

> **Tip**

>  The [jwsRepresentation](verificationresult/jwsrepresentation-21vgo.md) is the same as the [JWSTransaction](../appstoreserverapi/jwstransaction.md) that the [App Store Server API](../appstoreserverapi.md) returns and to the [JWSTransaction](../appstoreservernotifications/jwstransaction.md) that you receive in [App Store Server Notifications V2](../appstoreservernotifications/app-store-server-notifications-v2.md). You can validate them on your server in the same way.

If StoreKit returns a transaction as verified, the transaction is valid for the device. For information about performing your own verification for a device, see [deviceVerification](transaction/deviceverification.md).

For more information about JWS, see the [IETF RFC 7515](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7515) specification.

### Access purchases made with the original API

All In-App Purchases that customers make are equally available to your app in this `Transaction` API, and in receipts using the [Original API for In-App Purchase](original-api-for-in-app-purchase.md), as follows:

- New purchases that customers make with the original API are available immediately using the `Transaction` API.
- Purchases that customers make with the [purchase(options:)](product/purchase%28options_%29.md) method are available in the original API when your app refreshes the receipt. For more information, see [SKReceiptRefreshRequest](skreceiptrefreshrequest.md).
