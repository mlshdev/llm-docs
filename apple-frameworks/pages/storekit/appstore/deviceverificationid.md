## Discussion

Use this property to verify whether an App Store-signed JSON Web Signature (JWS) is valid for the current device. The JWS may be one of the following:

- A [jwsRepresentation](../verificationresult/jwsrepresentation-21vgo.md) representing a signed transaction
- A [jwsRepresentation](../verificationresult/jwsrepresentation-178oj.md) representing a signed subscription renewal information
- A [jwsRepresentation](../verificationresult/jwsrepresentation-6ma59.md) representing a signed app transaction.

To verify that the JWS is valid for the current device, follow these steps:

1. Append the lowercased UUID string representation of this property, [deviceVerificationID](deviceverificationid.md), after the lowercased UUID string representation of the device verification nonce. For a transaction, the nonce is [deviceVerificationNonce](../transaction/deviceverificationnonce.md). For subscription renewal information, the nonce is [deviceVerificationNonce](../product/subscriptioninfo/renewalinfo/deviceverificationnonce.md). For an app transaction, the nonce is [deviceVerificationNonce](../apptransaction/deviceverificationnonce.md).
2. Compute the SHA-384 hash of the appended UUID strings.
3. Verify that the SHA-384 digest is equal to the device verification property. For a transaction, the device verification property is [deviceVerification](../transaction/deviceverification.md). For subscription renewal information, the device verification property is [deviceVerification](../product/subscriptioninfo/renewalinfo/deviceverification.md). For an app transaction, the device verifcation property is [deviceVerification](../apptransaction/deviceverification.md).
