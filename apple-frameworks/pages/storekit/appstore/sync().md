## Discussion

Include some mechanism in your app, such as a Restore Purchases button, to let users restore their in-app purchases. In rare cases when a user suspects the app isn’t showing all the transactions, call [sync()](sync%28%29.md). By calling [sync()](sync%28%29.md), you force the app to obtain transaction information and subscription status from the App Store.

> **Important**

>  Calling [sync()](sync%28%29.md)displays a system prompt that asks users to authenticate with their App Store credentials. Call this function only in response to an explicit user action, like tapping or clicking a button.

In regular operations, there’s no need to call [sync()](sync%28%29.md). StoreKit automatically keeps up to date transaction information and subscription status available to your app. When users reinstall your app or download it on a new device, the app automatically has all transactions available to it upon initial launch. There’s no need for users to ask your app to restore transactions — your app can immediately get the current entitlements using [currentEntitlements](../transaction/currententitlements.md) and transaction history using [all](../transaction/all.md). For more information about transactions, see [Transaction](../transaction.md).
