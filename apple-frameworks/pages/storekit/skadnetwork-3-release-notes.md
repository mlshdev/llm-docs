### New features

New features include:

- Devices can now send install-validation postbacks to multiple ad networks that sign their ads using version 3.0. One ad network receives a postback with a `did-win` parameter value of `true` for the ad impression that wins the ad attribution. Up to five other ad networks receive a postback with a `did-win` parameter value of `false` if their ad impressions qualified for, but didn’t win, the attribution.

For more information about signing ads with version 3.0, see [Signing and providing ads](signing-and-providing-ads.md). For more information about your ad’s eligibility to receive an attribution or a non-winning postback, see [Receiving ad attributions and postbacks](receiving-ad-attributions-and-postbacks.md). For details about the postback, see [Verifying an install-validation postback](verifying-an-install-validation-postback.md).
