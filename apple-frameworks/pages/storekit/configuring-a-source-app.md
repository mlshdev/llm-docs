Set up a source app to participate in ad campaigns.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

A *source app* is an app that participates in ad campaigns by displaying ads that an ad network signs. To participate in install validation, the source app needs to include ad network IDs in its `Info.plist` file. Ad networks are responsible for publishing or providing their ad network IDs to developers.

Only ads from ad networks that have an entry in the app’s `Info.plist` file are eligible for install validation. To work with multiple ad networks, include each of the ad network IDs in the source app’s `Info.plist` file, as follows:

1. Select `Info.plist` in the Project navigator in Xcode.
2. Click the Add button (+) beside a key in the property list editor and press Return.
3. Type the key name [SKAdNetworkItems](../bundleresources/information-property-list/skadnetworkitems.md).
4. Choose Array from the pop-up menu in the Type column.

Create an array that contains one dictionary for each allowed ad network, using the single key [SKAdNetworkIdentifier](../bundleresources/information-property-list/skadnetworkitems/skadnetworkidentifier.md). The string value for the key is the ad network ID.

> **Important**

>  Lowercase the ad network ID string; otherwise, the system doesn’t recognize it as valid.

The following example shows an array with two dictionaries that represent the example ad network IDs `example100.skadnetwork` and `example200.skadnetwork`:

```xml
<array>
    <dict>
        <key>SKAdNetworkIdentifier</key>
        <string>example100.skadnetwork</string>
    </dict>
    <dict>   
         <key>SKAdNetworkIdentifier</key>
         <string>example200.skadnetwork</string>
    </dict>
</array>
```
