## Overview

Auto-renewable subscriptions behave differently in the sandbox environment and the production environment.

In the sandbox environment, subscription renewals happen at an accelerated rate, and auto-renewable subscriptions renew up to 12 times after the initial purchase. This enables you to test how your app handles a subscription renewal, a subscription lapse, and a subscription history that includes gaps.

You can choose a subscription renewal speed for each Sandbox Apple Account in App Store Connect. For a complete list of subscription durations within the sandbox environment and more information, see [Manage Sandbox Apple Account settings](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/test-in-app-purchases/manage-sandbox-apple-account-settings/).

The accelerated expiration and renewal rates in the sandbox environment make it possible for subscriptions to expire before the system tries to renew them. When a subscription expires before the system tries to renew it, it results in a short lapse in the subscription period. These lapses are possible in production; verify that your app handles them appropriately.
