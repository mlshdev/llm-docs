## Discussion

Use this method to request tokens when your app uses the [ExternalPurchaseCustomLink](../externalpurchasecustomlink.md) API.

The token types you request depend on the region in which your app offers external purchases:

- For external purchases in the European Union (EU), request the `ACQUISITION` and `SERVICES` token types when your app launches, and immediately associate the tokens with a customer account on your server. You can also call this method at any other time, such as before communicating or promoting offers. The method returns a token of either token type until it expires.
- For external purchases in Brazil and Japan, request the [withinApp](tokentype/withinapp.md) or [outOfApp](tokentype/outofapp.md) token types. Request an [withinApp](tokentype/withinapp.md) token type for workflows that use an alternative payment provider inside the app. Request a [outOfApp](tokentype/outofapp.md) token type for workflows in which customers can complete transactions on a website, outside of the app. For more information, see [Payment options on the App Store in Brazil](https://developer.apple.com/support/payment-options-on-the-app-store-in-brazil) and [Payment options on the App Store in Japan](https://developer.apple.com/support/payment-options-on-the-app-store-in-japan), respectively.

The [withinApp](tokentype/withinapp.md) and [outOfApp](tokentype/outofapp.md) token types for Japan and Brazil are available in iOS 27.2 and later.

> **Tip**

> Request tokens before every potential transaction to ensure you have current tokens.

### Read and report tokens

Decode the token to read its contents, including its expiration date. For more information, see [Receiving and decoding external purchase tokens](../receiving-and-decoding-external-purchase-tokens.md). For a code example that shows requesting tokens, see [ExternalPurchaseCustomLink](../externalpurchasecustomlink.md).

Report tokens and all transactions associated with the tokens from your server, using the [External Purchase Server API](../../externalpurchaseserverapi.md).
