# Signing and providing ads (Swift)

**Framework:** StoreKit  
**Kind:** Article

Advertise apps by signing and providing StoreKit-rendered ads, view-through ads, or attributable web ads.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

SKAdNetwork supports several ways for ad networks to provide ads:

- StoreKit-rendered ads, where StoreKit displays an App Store product page as the ad impression
- View-through ads, where the ad network presents an ad in any format and reports the ad impression using the SKAdNetwork API
- Attributable web ads, where the ad network presents an ad on a Safari web page using the [SKAdNetwork for Web Ads](../skadnetworkforwebads.md) API

To differentiate StoreKit-rendered ads from view-through ads, SKAdNetwork defines a `fidelity-type` parameter, which you include in the ad signature, and receive in the install-validation postback. Use a `fidelity-type` value of `1` for StoreKit-rendered ads and attributable web ads, and `0` for view-through ads. The following table compares the ad presentation options:

| Ad presentation option | Description | Fidelity type | Availability |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| StoreKit-rendered ads | App Store product page that StoreKit renders | `1` | All SKAdNetwork versions |
| View-through ads | Custom, from the ad network | `0` | SKAdNetwork 2.2 and later |
| Attributable web ads (SKAdNetwork for Web Ads) | Custom, from the ad network | `1` | SKAdNetwork 4 and later |

For more information about availability and versions, see [SKAdNetwork release notes](skadnetwork-release-notes.md).

The `fidelity-type` can affect which ad receives attribution when the user experiences multiple ad impressions. For more information about how `fidelity-type` and the time of the ad impression affect attributions, see [Receiving ad attributions and postbacks](receiving-ad-attributions-and-postbacks.md).

Ad networks must cryptographically sign the ads. The signature contains information that includes a campaign identifier. If ads result in conversions, ad networks receive an install-validation postback that includes the campaign identifier. For more information about the postback, see [Verifying an install-validation postback](verifying-an-install-validation-postback.md).

### Provide a StoreKit-rendered ad

Follow these steps to display a StoreKit-rendered ad in your app:

1. Set [Ad network install-validation keys](ad-network-install-validation-keys.md) with values that represent the ad impression.
2. On the ad network’s server, generate the signature using those key values. Then, set the [SKStoreProductParameterAdNetworkAttributionSignature](skstoreproductparameteradnetworkattributionsignature.md) key with the signature value. For information about generating the signature, see [Generating the signature to validate StoreKit-rendered ads](generating-the-signature-to-validate-storekit-rendered-ads.md).
3. Call [loadProduct(withParameters:completionBlock:)](skstoreproductviewcontroller/loadproduct%28withparameters_completionblock_%29.md) using your ad network install-validation keys to load the ad.
4. Present the ad in your app according to your app’s design. You can use either an [SKOverlay](skoverlay.md) or an [SKStoreProductViewController](skstoreproductviewcontroller.md) to display a StoreKit-rendered ad. The `fidelity-type` value of a StoreKit-rendered ad is `1` in either case.

### Provide a view-through ad

Follow these steps to provide a view-through ad:

1. Create an [SKAdImpression](skadimpression.md) instance and set its properties to represent the ad impression.
2. On the ad network’s server, generate the signature based on those properties. Then set the [signature](skadimpression/signature.md) property in the [SKAdImpression](skadimpression.md) instance to the generated signature. For more information, see [Generating the signature to validate view-through ads](generating-the-signature-to-validate-view-through-ads.md).
3. Call [startImpression(\_:completionHandler:)](skadnetwork/startimpression%28__completionhandler_%29.md) and then present your custom ad to the user according to your app’s design.
4. Call [endImpression(\_:completionHandler:)](skadnetwork/endimpression%28__completionhandler_%29.md) when you finish presenting the ad.

### Provide an attributable web ad

Ad networks can sign attributable ads that websites can display in Safari. For more information, see [SKAdNetwork for Web Ads](../skadnetworkforwebads.md).
