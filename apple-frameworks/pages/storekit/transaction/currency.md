## Discussion

The [currency](currency.md) property represents the currency of the product’s [price](price.md) that the system records at the time of purchase.

> **Important**

>  For financial and accounting purposes, use the App Store Connect reporting tools. For more information, see [Download financial reports](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/getting-paid/download-financial-reports) and [Overview of reporting tools](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/measure-app-performance/overview-of-reporting-tools).

Don’t use [currency](currency.md) to infer the storefront. Use the [storefront](storefront.md) value in the transaction instead.

To access the transaction’s currency on systems earlier than iOS 16, iPadOS 16, macOS 13, tvOS 16, and watchOS 9, use [currencyCode](../product/subscriptioninfo/renewalinfo/currencycode.md).
