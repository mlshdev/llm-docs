# latest(for:)

**Framework:** StoreKit  
**Kind:** Type Method  
**Availability:** iOS 15.0+ · iPadOS 15.0+ · Mac Catalyst 15.0+ · macOS 12.0+ · tvOS 15.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 8.0+

Gets the customer’s most recent transaction for an In-App Purchase.

## Declaration

```swift
static func latest(for productID: String) async -> VerificationResult<Transaction>?
```

## Parameters

- `productID`: The product identifier that the method uses to look up the most recent transaction.

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

A [VerificationResult](../verificationresult.md) with a single [Transaction](../transaction.md), or `nil` if the customer hasn’t purchased the product.

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

Call this method for any type of In-App Purchase. The following code example illustrates requesting the most recent transaction to determine whether the customer purchased the product indicated by the string `productIdentifier`:

```swift
guard let verificationResult = await Transaction.latest(for: productIdentifier) else {    
    // The customer hasn't purchased this product.
    return
}

switch verificationResult {
case .verified(let transaction):
    // Check the transaction and give the customer access to purchased 
    // content as appropriate.
    ...
case .unverified(let transaction, let verificationError):
    // Handle unverified transactions based 
    // on your business model.
    ...
}
```

By default, when the [SKIncludeConsumableInAppPurchaseHistory](../../bundleresources/information-property-list/skincludeconsumableinapppurchasehistory.md) property list key is `false`, this method excludes finished consumable in-app purchases unless they are refunded or revoked.

If you set the [SKIncludeConsumableInAppPurchaseHistory](../../bundleresources/information-property-list/skincludeconsumableinapppurchasehistory.md) property list key to `true`, this method returns all transactions, including consumable In-App Purchases that your app marked as finished ([finish()](finish%28%29.md)).
