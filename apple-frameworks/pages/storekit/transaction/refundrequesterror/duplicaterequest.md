## Discussion

StoreKit returns this error if the App Store has previously received a refund request for this transaction and the refund decision is still pending, has been previously denied, or has been previously approved.

Consider checking the transaction’s [revocationDate](../revocationdate.md) or [revocationReason](../revocationreason-swift.property.md) before calling [beginRefundRequest(for:in:)](../beginrefundrequest%28for_in_%29-65tph.md) to identify whether the App Store has already refunded the transaction.
