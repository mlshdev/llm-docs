# deviceVerification

**Framework:** StoreKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 15.0+ · iPadOS 15.0+ · Mac Catalyst 15.0+ · macOS 12.0+ · tvOS 15.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 8.0+

The device verification value you use to verify whether the transaction belongs to the device.

## Declaration

```swift
let deviceVerification: Data
```

## Discussion

Whenever StoreKit returns a verified transaction, the transaction is valid for the device. To perform your own verification, compute the device verification hash as follows:

1. Get the lowercase UUID string representation of [deviceVerificationNonce](deviceverificationnonce.md).
2. Append the lowercase UUID string representation of [deviceVerificationID](../appstore/deviceverificationid.md).
3. Compute the SHA-384 hash of the ASCII representation of the combined string.

Compare the value you calculated to the transaction’s [deviceVerification](deviceverification.md) value. If the values match, the transaction is valid for the device. Otherwise, the verification fails and the transaction isn’t valid for the device. The following example illustrates validating a transaction.

```swift
guard let deviceVerificationUUID = AppStore.deviceVerificationID else {
    print("Device Verification ID isn't available.")
    return
}

// Assemble the values to hash.
let deviceVerificationIDString = deviceVerificationUUID.uuidString.lowercased()
let nonceString = transaction.deviceVerificationNonce.uuidString.lowercased()
let hashTargetString = nonceString.appending(deviceVerificationIDString)

// Compute the hash.
let hashTargetData = Data(hashTargetString.utf8)
let digest = SHA384.hash(data: hashTargetData)
let digestData = Data(digest)
if digestData == transaction.deviceVerification {
    print("Transaction is valid for this device.")
} else {
    print("Transaction isn't valid for this device.")
}
```
