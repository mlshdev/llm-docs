## Discussion

This property indicates the rounded percentage of the purchase amount that the App Store has refunded or revoked.

The value is present only for transactions with a non-reversed refund. Valid values range from 0.0 to 100.0:

- For auto-renewable subscriptions: 0.0-100.0% based on time remaining in the subscription period
- For consumables, non-consumables, and non-renewing subscriptions: 0.0-100.0% based on consumption data

If the purchase had a quantity greater than 1, this percentage applies to the full quantity. For example, if 1 of 3 items was refunded, the value would be approximately 33.333. The following table shows several examples of revocation percentages, and their milliunit equivalents:

| Percentage | Integer equivalent, in milliunits |
| --- | --- |
| 67.932% | 67932 |
| 0.015% | 15 |
| 40% | 40000 |
| 100% | 100000 |

> **Note**

> This property is not present for Advanced Commerce transactions, which use [amount](advancedcommerceinfo-swift.struct/refund/amount.md) instead.
