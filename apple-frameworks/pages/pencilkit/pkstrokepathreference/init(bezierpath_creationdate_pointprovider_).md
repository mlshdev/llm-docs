# init(bezierPath:creationDate:pointProvider:) (Swift)

**Framework:** PencilKit  
**Kind:** Initializer  
**Availability:** iOS 27.0+ · iPadOS 27.0+ · Mac Catalyst 27.0+ · macOS 27.0+ · visionOS 27.0+

Creates a stroke path recreating the specified Bézier path as a cubic uniform B-Spline.

## Declaration

```swift
convenience init(bezierPath: CGPath, creationDate: Date, pointProvider: (PKConvertedBezierPointReference) -> PKStrokePoint)
```

## Parameters

- `bezierPath`: The Bézier path to convert to a cubic uniform B-Spline.
- `creationDate`: The start time of this path.
- `pointProvider`: Block to initialize the `PKStrokePoint`s of the path. A single `PKConvertedBezierPoint` instance is shared across all converted points.

## Discussion

The count of control points of the generated spline is not guaranteed to be a specific value except when the provided path is the output of `bezierRepresentation->CGPathRef`, where it will match the original curve.

The output B-Spline will have continuous curvature and 0 curvature at the endpoints. In cases where the B-Spline cannot fully recreate the Bézier path, it will be an approximation. For example, if the given Bézier path includes `line to` elements, these will produce straight line segments in the resulting B-Spline, but if a `line to` element is adjacent to a `curve to` element, the resulting curve may not match the original.

> **Warning**

> For a Bézier path with multiple subpaths, only the first will be converted.
