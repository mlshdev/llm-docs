# inboundStreams(\_:)

**Framework:** Network  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 26.0+ · iPadOS 26.0+ · Mac Catalyst 26.0+ · macOS 26.0+ · tvOS 26.0+ · visionOS 26.0+ · watchOS 26.0+

Handle inbound streams and provide a closure on which callback handlers will be executed. When the `NetworkConnection<QUIC>` state moves to `ready`, the internal listener is registered with the system and can receive incoming streams on the multiplexing instance. `inboundStreams` should only be called once on a `NetworkConnection<QUIC>`, and multiple calls to run will throw an exception.

## Declaration

```swift
final func inboundStreams(_ handler: @escaping @isolated(any) @Sendable (QUIC.Stream<QUICStream>) async throws -> Void) async throws
```

## Discussion

If the `NetworkConnection<QUIC>` is not started at the time that `inboundStreams` is invoked, it will be started.

The closure inherits the isolation domain of the caller.
