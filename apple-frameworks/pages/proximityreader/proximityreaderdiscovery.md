## Overview

Use a [ProximityReaderDiscovery](proximityreaderdiscovery.md) object to educate people on how to read contactless credentials with their iPhone. When building a reader interface in your app, include controls to display help information. When a person taps those controls, use this type to present a view controller with information about how to use a particular feature. The system manages the presented view controller, displaying materials to teach people how the system works.

Create a [ProximityReaderDiscovery](proximityreaderdiscovery.md) object in response to requests for help from your app’s interface. Fetch a relevant help topic and present that topic using the [presentContent(\_:from:)](proximityreaderdiscovery/presentcontent%28__from_%29.md) method, as shown in the following example. Present the topic displays a new view controller with information about how to use the relevant features. This view controller remains visible until the person dismisses it, at which point control returns to your app’s current view controller.

```
let proximityReaderDiscovery = ProximityReaderDiscovery()

Task {
    do {
        let content = try await proximityReaderDiscovery.content(for: ProximityReaderDiscovery.Topic.payment(.howToTap))
        try await proximityReaderDiscovery.presentContent(content, from: myCurrentViewController)
    } catch {
        // Handle content display errors.
    }
}
```
