## Discussion

Call this method to read either a contactless payment card or a loyalty card. This method displays a system sheet with instructions on what the person needs to do. The system UI remains onscreen until the system reads the person’s card, you cancel the operation, or an error occurs. If it reads a card successfully, the method returns the card information as a result.

When the `stopOnVasResult` parameter is `true`:

- If the customer taps their loyalty card while the UI is present, the system closes the sheet and returns [VASReadResult](../vasreadresult.md) as a result.
- If the customer taps their payment card while the UI is present, the system closes the sheet and returns [PaymentCardReadResult](../paymentcardreadresult.md) as a result.

When the `stopOnVasResult` parameter is `false`:

- If the customer taps their Apple Pay Wallet, containing both a relevant loyalty card and a payment card, the system closes the sheet and returns both [PaymentCardReadResult](../paymentcardreadresult.md) and [VASReadResult](../vasreadresult.md) as a result.
- If the customer taps their Apple Pay Wallet, containing only a relevant loyalty card, the system closes the sheet and returns [VASReadResult](../vasreadresult.md) as a result.
- If the customer taps their payment card, the system closes the sheet and returns [PaymentCardReadResult](../paymentcardreadresult.md) as a result.

> **Throws**

> This method throws a [PaymentCardReaderSession.ReadError](readerror.md) if a person dismisses the sheet or the sheet fails to appear.
