## Discussion

Call this method when the payment card issuer requests a PIN for the current transaction. When you call this method, the system displays UI with instructions on what the person needs to do. This UI remains onscreen until the system reads the person’s PIN, you cancel the operation, or an error occurs.

> **Important**

> The encrypted payment card data are only kept 55 seconds after previous read if the PIN was not requested by the card. After this delay, this method will return [PaymentCardReaderSession.ReadError.pinEntryFailed](readerror/pinentryfailed.md)

> **Throws**

> This method throws a [PaymentCardReaderSession.ReadError](readerror.md) if a person dismisses the sheet or the sheet fails to appear.
