## Discussion

This method should be used after a read, when the merchant receives the [PaymentCardReadResult](../paymentcardreadresult.md) and decides to not accept the payment. It must be called within the 60 seconds allowance time window and the payment must not have been included in a batch, otherwise an error will be thrown.

> **Throws**

> This method throws a `ReadError` if no previous read was executed, if invoked after the 60 seconds allowance time window or if the payment you are trying to decline belongs to a batch.
