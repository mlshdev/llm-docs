# Rendering Gaussian splats with RealityKit

**Kind:** Sample Code  
**Availability:** visionOS 27.0+ · Xcode 27.0+

Bring a real-world scan into your app by loading splat data from a USD or PLY file.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

A Gaussian splat asset represents a scene as a large collection of colored, oriented ellipsoids instead of a mesh, so a real-world capture keeps details that are hard to model by hand, like soil texture or the fine edges of leaves. Each splat carries position, scale, rotation, opacity, and a set of spherical harmonic coefficients that let its color shift depending on the angle you view it from. This reproduces specular highlights and reflections that were present in the original capture. The capture bakes that color in, so scene lighting doesn’t change how a splat looks, and a splat won’t cast a shadow the way mesh-based content does.

This sample uses RealityKit to bring a scan of a potted plant into a mixed immersive space. The app loads the same plant from either a USD file or a PLY file, then lets the person wearing the device pick the plant up, move it, and anchor it to a nearby table or floor. A scene can only render a limited number of splat entities at once, so budget them the way you would any other GPU-heavy resource.

## Configure the sample code project

Because Gaussian splats don’t render in the Simulator, ensure your splats render properly on device.

## Load a splat from a USD file

The sample’s bundled USD asset stores its splat data in a primitive whose schema type is `ParticleField3DGaussianSplat`. This primitive isn’t defined by RealityKit or USDKit, and is instead created by the tool that authored the asset. `loadUSDEntity(assetName:)` opens the stage with [USDStage](../usdkit/usdstage.md), finds the primitive with that schema using [isSchema(\_:)](../usdkit/usdprim/isschema%28__%29.md), and reads its attributes into a `GaussianSplatBuffers`:

```swift
func loadUSDEntity(assetName: String) async throws -> Entity {
    let url = try bundleUSDURL(assetName: assetName)

    let buffers = try await Task.detached(priority: .userInitiated) {
        let stage = try USDStage.open(url)

        guard let splatPrim = stage.descendants.first(where: {
            $0.isSchema("ParticleField3DGaussianSplat")
        }) else {
            throw GaussianSplatError.invalidData("No ParticleField3DGaussianSplat prim found in \(url.lastPathComponent)")
        }

        return try buildBuffers(from: splatPrim)
    }.value

    return try makeSplatEntity(from: buffers, isLinear: true)
}
```

RealityKit expects each rotation as four contiguous floats in `w`, `x`, `y`, `z` order. [USDValue.Quatf](../usdkit/usdvalue/quatf.md) exposes its parts through the [real](../usdkit/usdvalue/quatf/real.md) and [imaginary](../usdkit/usdvalue/quatf/imaginary.md) accessors rather than as raw fields in that layout, so the loop reads each component through its accessor and writes it into the matching slot instead of copying the struct’s bytes directly:

```swift
private nonisolated func fillRotationBuffer(_ buffer: LowLevelBuffer?, quatArray: [USDValue.Quatf], count: Int) {
    buffer?.withUnsafeMutableBytes { dst in
        let out = dst.bindMemory(to: Float.self)
        for idx in 0..<count {
            let quat = quatArray[idx]
            out[idx * 4 + 0] = quat.real          // w
            out[idx * 4 + 1] = quat.imaginary.x   // x
            out[idx * 4 + 2] = quat.imaginary.y   // y
            out[idx * 4 + 3] = quat.imaginary.z   // z
        }
    }
}
```

## Load a splat from a PLY file

PLY is a generic 3D file format and its header declares the elements and properties inside the file. PLY doesn’t have a standard schema for Gaussian splat data. This sample expects a plain-text header that declares each property, followed by a binary block with one record per splat, using the property set that Gaussian splatting tools have settled on as a common convention:

| Property | Contains | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `x, y, z` | 3 floats | Sets the splat’s center in local space. |
| `f_dc_0..2` | 3 floats | Sets the splat’s base color, which looks the same from every angle. |
| `f_rest_0..N` | Varies (0, 9, 24, or 45 floats) | Adds spherical harmonic coefficients that shift the splat’s color based on the viewing angle. The file stores these coefficients as channel-major: all R values, then all G, then all B. The count depends on the SH degree the asset uses. |
| `opacity` | 1 float | Sets the splat’s opacity as an unbounded value. RealityKit maps it to 0…1 with the sigmoid function, `1 / (1 + e^-x)`. |
| `scale_0..2` | 3 floats | Sets the splat’s per-axis size, stored in log space. RealityKit converts it with `exp()`. |
| `rot_0..3` | 4 floats | Forms a quaternion, in `w`, `x`, `y`, `z` order, that sets the splat’s rotation. |

`loadPLYEntity(assetName:)` reads the file, deinterleaves those properties into a `GaussianSplatBuffers`, and calls `makeSplatEntity(from:)` without `isLinear`, so RealityKit converts the log-space scale and unbounded opacity:

```swift
func loadPLYEntity(assetName: String) async throws -> Entity {
    let url = try bundlePLYURL(assetName: assetName)
    let buffers = try await Task.detached(priority: .userInitiated) {
        let splatData = try readGaussianSplatFile(url)
        return try deinterleaveGaussianSplatData(splatData)
    }.value
    return try makeSplatEntity(from: buffers)
}
```

The `deinterleaveGaussianSplatData(_:)` method also sanitizes every value it copies, replacing any `NaN` or infinite float with `0`. RealityKit rejects a splat buffer that contains a non-finite value, so a loader reading arbitrary capture data needs to clean it up first.

<a id="Prepare-buffers-for-splat-assets"></a>

## Prepare buffers for splat assets

Whichever format the sample starts from, it fills the same GPU buffers for position, scale, rotation, opacity, and spherical harmonics. This sample defines a custom structure, `GaussianSplatBuffers`, that holds those buffers, and a helper turns a filled-in structure into something the app can add to a scene. `assembleSplatComponent(from:isLinear:)` packages the buffers into a [GaussianSplatResource.BufferResource](../realitykit/gaussiansplatresource/bufferresource-swift.struct.md), wraps that in a [GaussianSplatResource](../realitykit/gaussiansplatresource.md), and builds a [GaussianSplatComponent](../realitykit/gaussiansplatcomponent.md) from it. `assembleSplatComponent(from:isLinear:)` also sets the resource’s [scaleActivation](../realitykit/gaussiansplatresource/scaleactivation.md) and [opacityActivation](../realitykit/gaussiansplatresource/opacityactivation.md), which tell RealityKit how to interpret the raw numbers in the buffers:

```swift
func assembleSplatComponent(from buffers: GaussianSplatBuffers, isLinear: Bool = false) throws -> GaussianSplatComponent {
    guard let pos = buffers.positionBuffer,
          let scale = buffers.scaleBuffer,
          let rotation = buffers.rotationBuffer,
          let opacity = buffers.opacityBuffer,
          let shBuf = buffers.shBuffer else {
        throw GaussianSplatError.invalidData("One or more GPU buffers failed to allocate")
    }

    let degree = GaussianSplatResource.SphericalHarmonicDegree(rawValue: buffers.degreeSH) ?? .zero
    let bufferResource = try GaussianSplatResource.BufferResource(
        count: Int(buffers.splatCount),
        position: makeDescriptor(buffer: pos, format: .float3, stride: 3 * 4),
        scale: makeDescriptor(buffer: scale, format: .float3, stride: 3 * 4),
        rotation: makeDescriptor(buffer: rotation, format: .float4, stride: 4 * 4),
        opacity: makeDescriptor(buffer: opacity, format: .float, stride: 1 * 4),
        sphericalHarmonics: (makeSHDescriptor(buffer: shBuf, tupleSH: buffers.tupleSH), degree)
    )

    let splatResource = GaussianSplatResource(bufferResource)
    if isLinear {
        splatResource.scaleActivation   = .identity
        splatResource.opacityActivation = .identity
    } else {
        splatResource.scaleActivation   = .exponential
        splatResource.opacityActivation = .sigmoid
    }
    return GaussianSplatComponent(splatResource)
}
```

This sample passes `isLinear: true` for data that’s already in linear space, like the USD version of the plant asset. For the PLY asset, the sample leaves it `false`, allowing RealityKit to apply the `.exponential` and `.sigmoid` conversions for splat data.

<a id="Add-interactivity-to-a-splat-entity"></a>

## Add interactivity to a splat entity

A splat entity is an [Entity](../realitykit/entity.md) like any other, so it takes the same components. The sample adds a [GroundingShadowComponent](../realitykit/groundingshadowcomponent.md) and a [ManipulationComponent](../realitykit/manipulationcomponent.md) so a person can pick up the plant and move it.

```swift
private func configureManipulableObject(_ entity: Entity) {
    ManipulationComponent.configureEntity(
        entity,
        collisionShapes: [ShapeResource.generateBox(size: SIMD3<Float>(repeating: 0.5))]
    )
    var manipulation = entity.components[ManipulationComponent.self] ?? ManipulationComponent()

    // ...

    entity.components.set(manipulation)
    entity.components.set(GroundingShadowComponent(castsShadow: true))
}
```
