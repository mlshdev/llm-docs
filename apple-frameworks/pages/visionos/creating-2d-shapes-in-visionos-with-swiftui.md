# Creating 2D shapes with SwiftUI

**Kind:** Sample Code  
**Availability:** visionOS 2.0+ · Xcode 16.0+

Draw two-dimensional shapes in your visionOS app with SwiftUI shapes or with your custom shapes.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

This sample code project demonstrates how to create and display 2D shapes in your visionOS app, using SwiftUI views that adopt the [Shape](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/shape) protocol, including your custom types.

The following image shows the main view of the app, which draws four shapes:

- A circle
- A rectangle
- A triangle
- A dashed line

SwiftUI defines the `Circle` and `Rectangle` types, and the sample defines the custom types `Triangle` and `Line`.

### Add existing shapes from SwiftUI to a view

The app’s main view draws the outline of a circle and a rectangle by adding an instance of [Circle](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/circle) and [Rectangle](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/rectangle), respectively.

```swift
struct ShapesView: View {
    var body: some View {
        /// The gap between each shape.
        let spaceBetweenShapes: CGFloat = 30.0

        /// The width and height for the frame of each shape view.
        let shapeScale: CGFloat = 100.0

        /// A width for all the lines in each shape.
        let strokeWidth: CGFloat = 5.0

        // ...

        HStack(spacing: spaceBetweenShapes) {
            Circle()
                .stroke(lineWidth: strokeWidth)
                .frame(width: shapeScale, height: shapeScale)
            Rectangle()
                .stroke(lineWidth: strokeWidth)
                .frame(width: shapeScale, height: shapeScale)
                
            // ...
        }
    }
}
```

The [stroke(\_:lineWidth:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/shape/stroke%28_:linewidth:%29) method sets the thickness of the line that the shape uses to draw itself, and the [frame(width:height:alignment:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/frame%28width:height:alignment:%29) method puts the shape inside an invisible view.

### Create custom shape types

This sample defines custom shape types for lines and triangles that draw themselves by adopting the [Shape](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/shape) protocol and implementing a custom [Path](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/path) method.

The `Line` type stores two endpoints and draws a line between them in its `path(in:)` method.

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct Line: Shape {
    let endPoint1: CGPoint
    let endPoint2: CGPoint

    // ...
    
    func path(in bounds: CGRect) -> Path {
        /// The drawing path for the triangle shape.
        var path = Path()
        
        // Draw the line between the two endpoints.
        path.move(to: endPoint1)
        path.addLine(to: endPoint2)

        return path
    }
}
```

The `Triangle` type stores three vertices for a triangle and draws a line between each vertex in its custom `path(in:)` method.

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct Triangle: Shape {
    let vertex1: CGPoint
    let vertex2: CGPoint
    let vertex3: CGPoint

    // ...
    
    func path(in bounds: CGRect) -> Path {
        /// The drawing path for the triangle shape.
        var path = Path()

        // Start at the first vertex.
        path.move(to: vertex1)

        // Draw the triangle's first two sides.
        path.addLine(to: vertex2)
        path.addLine(to: vertex3)
        
        // Draw the triangle's third side by returning to the first vertex.
        path.closeSubpath()

        return path
    }
}
```

The shapes view adds a triangle by creating three [CGPoint](../corefoundation/cgpoint.md) instances and passing them to the `Triangle` initializer.

```swift
struct ShapesView: View {
    var body: some View {
        /// The gap between each shape.
        let spaceBetweenShapes: CGFloat = 30.0

        /// The width and height for the frame of each shape view.
        let shapeScale: CGFloat = 100.0

        /// A width for all the lines in each shape.
        let strokeWidth: CGFloat = 5.0

        /// The upper-leading corner of the triangle.
        let vertex1 = CGPoint(x: 0.0, y: 0.0)

        /// The lower-trailing corner of the triangle.
        let vertex2 = CGPoint(x: shapeScale, y: shapeScale)

        /// The lower-leading corner of the triangle.
        let vertex3 = CGPoint(x: 0.0, y: shapeScale)

        // ...

        HStack(spacing: spaceBetweenShapes) {
            // ...
            
            Triangle(vertex1, vertex2, vertex3)
                .stroke(lineWidth: strokeWidth)
                .frame(width: shapeScale, height: shapeScale)
         
            // ...
        }
    }
}
```

Each vertex uses SwiftUI coordinates. The origin of this coordinate system is in the upper-left corner, and the y-axis increases in a downward direction.

### Add customizations to shape types

To draw a line with dashes, add a `dashed(_:)` method to the `Line` type, which the sample puts in an extension.

```swift
extension Line {
    func dashed(_ width: CGFloat,
                _ dashPattern: [CGFloat]? = nil) -> some Shape {
        let pattern = dashPattern ?? [width]
        let style = StrokeStyle(lineWidth: width, dash: pattern)

        return stroke(style: style)
    }
}
```

The method creates an instance of a line, applying a stroke style to it.

The shapes view calls this method to create a dashed line based on the stroke width for all the shapes in the view.

```swift
        /// The gap between each shape.
        let spaceBetweenShapes: CGFloat = 30.0

        /// The width and height for the frame of each shape view.
        let shapeScale: CGFloat = 100.0

        /// A width for all the lines in each shape.
        let strokeWidth: CGFloat = 5.0

        // ...

        /// A pattern for the dashed line.
        let strokePattern = [3 * strokeWidth, 2 * strokeWidth]

        HStack(spacing: spaceBetweenShapes) {
            // ...
            
            Line(shapeScale)
                .dashed(strokeWidth, strokePattern)
                .frame(width: shapeScale, height: shapeScale)
        }
    }
}
```

In this sample, the view draws each line segment one-and-a-half times longer than the gaps between adjacent line segments.
