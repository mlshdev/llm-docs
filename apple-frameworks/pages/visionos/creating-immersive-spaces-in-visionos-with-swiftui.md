# Creating an immersive space in visionOS

**Kind:** Sample Code  
**Availability:** visionOS 2.0+ · Xcode 16.0+

Enhance your visionOS app by adding an immersive space using RealityKit.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

This sample code project demonstrates how to create an [ImmersiveSpace](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/immersivespace) in visionOS, showcasing a collection of rocks orbiting around a person, like the scene in the following video:

Video: sample-immersive.1-main-view.mp4

The `TurnTableSystem` runs the core functionality to manage the rotational dynamics of entities through the `TurnTableComponent`, which defines the speed and rotation axis. The `Entity` class extends with a method to populate the immersive space with 3D rock entities and then apply a random transformation to create a halo effect. The `ImmersiveView` integrates these features and showcases the potential of SwiftUI and RealityKit to build an exciting augmented reality experience.

### Create the turntable system

The sample creates a custom system and corresponding component to apply a series of random rotations to the content in the immersive environment, resulting in a collection of objects that orbit around a person.

```swift
import SwiftUI
import RealityKit

struct TurnTableComponent: Component {
    /// The duration of the orbit effect.
    var time: TimeInterval = 0
           
    /// The speed at which the entity moves over time.
    var speed: TimeInterval
           
    /// The axis that the object orbits around.
    var axis: SIMD3<Float>
           
    /// Initialize the turntable component by setting the speed and axis variables.
    init(speed: TimeInterval = 1.0, axis: SIMD3<Float> = [0, 1, 0]) {
        self.speed = speed
        self.axis = axis
    }
}
```

The `TurnTableComponent` stores the time, speed, and axis information that decides how each of the entities rotates over time.

The `TurnTableSystem` checks the current scene for any rendered content that contains a `TurnTableComponent`. If it detects the component, the system applies the value of `deltaTime` to the component’s `time` value and sets the orientation value to the component’s `axis` variable.

```swift
import SwiftUI
import RealityKit

struct TurnTableSystem: System {
    /// A value to check whether the entity has the required component.
    static let query = EntityQuery(where: .has(TurnTableComponent.self))

    /// Initialize the system with the RealityKit scene.
    init(scene: RealityKit.Scene) { }

    // Update the entities to apply the time value and orientation.
    func update(context: SceneUpdateContext) {
        // Iterate over entities that match the query and are currently rendering.
        for entity in context.entities(matching: Self.query, updatingSystemWhen: .rendering) {
            /// The variable to get the `TurnTableComponent` from the entity.
            var comp = entity.components[TurnTableComponent.self]!

            // Set the time variable to increase as time passes.
            comp.time += context.deltaTime

            // Update the component in the entity.
            entity.components[TurnTableComponent.self] = comp

            // Adjust the orientation to update the angle, speed, and axis of rotation.
            entity.setOrientation(simd_quatf(angle: Float(0.1 * comp.speed), axis: comp.axis), relativeTo: entity)
        }
    }
}
```

<a id="Extend-the-entity-class"></a>

### Extend the entity class

The sample extends the [Entity](../realitykit/entity.md) class to load a file as a model component and apply the model for the halo effect.

```swift
import RealityKit

extension Entity {
    /// The name of the 3D model resource file.
    static var fileName: String = "rock"
           
    /// The model component loads a given filename.
    static var rockModel: ModelComponent = {
        let rock = try! Entity.loadModel(named: fileName)
        return rock.model!
    }()

    //...
}
```

To create a halo effect, the sample extends the `Entity` class with a custom method called `addHalo()`. The method loops through the total number of rocks that the app creates, and makes an array of entities with random size, speed, and rotation.

```swift
import RealityKit

extension Entity {
    // ...
    
    /// Assign a series of random rotations, translations, and scales for each rock model.
    func addHalo() {
        /// The number of models to generate.
        let modelCount: Int = 50

        // Create each model and apply a random transform, scale, and time interval.
        for _ in 0..<modelCount {
            /// The dedicated entity for the model.
            let entity = Entity()

            // Assign the model as a component.
            entity.components.set(Self.rockModel)

            /// A transform that contains a random rotation along the y-axis.
            let rotate0 = Transform(rotation: simd_quatf(angle: .random(in: 0...(2 * .pi)), axis: [0, 1, 0])).matrix

            /// A transform that adjusts along the z-axis.
            let translate = Transform(translation: [0, 0, 1]).matrix

            /// A transform that contains a random rotation along the y-axis.
            let rotate1 = Transform(rotation: simd_quatf(angle: .random(in: 0...(2 * .pi)), axis: [0, 1, 0])).matrix

            /// A transform that contains a random rotation along the x-axis.
            let rotate2 = Transform(rotation: simd_quatf(angle: .random(in: (-.pi / 9)...(.pi / 9)), axis: [1, 0, 0])).matrix

            // Assign the entity a transform based on the matrix product of each rotation and translation variable.
            entity.transform = Transform(matrix: rotate1 * rotate2 * translate * rotate0)

            // Assign the entity a random scale along all axes.
            entity.setScale(SIMD3(repeating: 0.001 * .random(in: 0.5...2)), relativeTo: entity)

            // Assign the entity's `TurnTableComponent` a random speed at which to rotate along the axis.
            entity.components.set(TurnTableComponent(
                speed: .random(in: 0.001...0.1),
                axis: [
                    .random(in: -1...1),
                    .random(in: -1...1),
                    .random(in: -1...1)]
            ))

            // Add the entity as a subentity.
            self.addChild(entity)
        }
    }
}
```

The method constructs and returns a single entity that contains multiple subentities, each with a model that applies unique rotations and speed through the `TurnTableComponent`.

### Create the immersive view

The sample defines a custom view for an immersive space that creates a single entity and applies the `addHalo()` method.

```swift
import SwiftUI
import RealityKit

struct ImmersiveView: View {
    /// The average human height in meters.
    let avgHeight: Float = 1.70

    /// The rate of movement at which the rocks orbit.
    let speed: TimeInterval = 0.03

    var body: some View {
        // Initiate a `RealityView` to create a ring
        // of rocks to orbit around a person.
        RealityView { content in
            /// The entity to contain the models.
            let rootEntity = Entity()

            // Set the y-axis position to the average human height.
            rootEntity.position.y += avgHeight

            // Create the halo effect with the `addHalo` method.
            rootEntity.addHalo()

            // Set the rotation speed for the rocks.
            rootEntity.components.set(TurnTableComponent(speed: speed))

            // Register the `TurnTableSystem` to handle the rotation logic.
            TurnTableSystem.registerSystem()

            // Add the entity to the view.
            content.add(rootEntity)
        }
    }
}
```

The `rootEntity` includes a `TurnTableComponent` to enable an orbit effect similar to the collective rotation of all the rock entities.

<a id="Run-the-immersive-scene"></a>

### Run the immersive scene

The `Immersion` app structure includes an `ImmersiveSpace` entry to the scene to include in the app’s environment.

```swift
import SwiftUI

@main
struct Immersion: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            MainView()
        }
        
        // Defines an immersive space as a part of the scene.
        ImmersiveSpace(id: "ImmersiveScene") {
            ImmersiveView()
        }
    }
}
```

The sample’s main view uses the [openImmersiveSpace](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/environmentvalues/openimmersivespace) instance property to call the immersive space that the `Immersion` app structure defines.

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct MainView: View {
    /// The environment value to get the `OpenImmersiveSpaceAction` instance.
    @Environment(\.openImmersiveSpace) var openImmersiveSpace

    var body: some View {
        // Displays a line of text and
        // opens a new `ImmersiveSpace` environment.
        Text("Immersive Content Example")
            .onAppear {
                Task {
                    await openImmersiveSpace(id: "ImmersiveScene")
                }
            }
    }
}

```
