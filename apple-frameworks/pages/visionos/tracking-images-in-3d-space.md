# Tracking preregistered images in 3D space

**Kind:** Article

Place content based on the current position of a known image in a person’s surroundings.

## Overview

Use ARKit’s support for tracking 2D images to place 3D content in a space. ARKit provides updates to the image’s location as it moves relative to the person. If you supply one or more reference images in your app’s asset catalog, people can use a real-world copy of that image to place virtual 3D content in your app. For example, if you design a set of movie posters and provide those assets to people in the form of real-world environments, they can view the trailer for the movie in a fully immersive experience.

The following example tracks a set of images loaded from an app’s asset catalog:

```swift
let session = ARKitSession()
let imageInfo = ImageTrackingProvider(
    referenceImages: ReferenceImage.loadReferenceImages(inGroupNamed: "playingcard-photos")
)

if ImageTrackingProvider.isSupported {
    Task {
        try await session.run([imageInfo])
        for await update in imageInfo.anchorUpdates {
            updateImage(update.anchor)
        }
    }
}

func updateImage(_ anchor: ImageAnchor) {
    if imageAnchors[anchor.id] == nil {
        // Add a new entity to represent this image.
        let entity = ModelEntity(mesh: .generateSphere(radius: 0.05))
        entityMap[anchor.id] = entity
        rootEntity.addChild(entity)
    }
    
    if anchor.isTracked {
        entityMap[anchor.id]?.transform = Transform(matrix: anchor.originFromAnchorTransform)
    }
}
```

If you know the real-world dimensions of the images you’re tracking, use the [physicalSize](../arkit/referenceimage/physicalsize.md) property to improve tracking accuracy. The [estimatedScaleFactor](../arkit/imageanchor/estimatedscalefactor.md) property provides information about how the scale of the tracked image differs from the expected physical size you provide.
