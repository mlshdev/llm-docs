# Tracking specific points in world space

**Kind:** Sample Code  
**Availability:** visionOS 26.0+ · Xcode 26.0+

Retrieve the position and orientation of anchors your app stores in ARKit.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

Use world anchors along with an ARKit session’s [WorldTrackingProvider](../arkit/worldtrackingprovider.md) to track points of interest in the world over time, as a person moves while wearing the device, and across device usage sessions. For example, someone might place a 3D object in a specific position on their desk and expect it to come back the next time they use the device.

ARKit keeps track of a unique identifier for each world anchor your app creates and automatically places those anchors back in the space when the person returns to your app in the same location. A world tracking provider also provides the position of the device the person is wearing.

### Start an ARKit session with world tracking

Use an [ARKitSession](../arkit/arkitsession.md) configured for world tracking to start receiving updates on the world anchors your app places. The following shows updates to world anchors your app previously registered using the [addAnchor(\_:)](../arkit/worldtrackingprovider/addanchor%28__%29.md) method:

```swift
let session = ARKitSession()
let worldInfo = WorldTrackingProvider()

Task {
    try await session.run([worldInfo])
    
    for await update in worldInfo.anchorUpdates {
        switch update.event {
        case .added, .updated:
            // Update the app's understanding of this world anchor.
            print("Anchor position updated.")
        case .removed:
            // Remove content related to this anchor.
            print("Anchor position now unknown.")
    }
}
```

> **Important**

> If a person repositions the current space — for example, by holding down the Digital Crown — world anchor updates begin updating their position relative to the new world origin. For example, a world anchor placed on a table still reports information about the table’s position, but those positions are relative to the updated world origin.

### Create and add world anchors

You can create world anchors for any point of interest in your app’s world coordinate system once you’ve started a world tracking ARKit session. For example, you might track that a person placed an item at a particular offset from a desk in their space:

```swift
let anchor = WorldAnchor(originFromAnchorTransform: deskPlane.originFromAnchorTransform + offset)
try await worldInfo.addAnchor(anchor)
```

Once you add a world anchor to your app’s tracking provider using the [addAnchor(\_:)](../arkit/worldtrackingprovider/addanchor%28__%29.md) method, the [anchorUpdates](../arkit/worldtrackingprovider/anchorupdates.md) sequence in the current session and future runs of your app provides updates to the current position of that new world anchor.

### Persist world anchors across sessions

The only information ARKit persists about the world anchors in your app is their [UUID](../foundation/uuid.md) — a [WorldAnchor](../arkit/worldanchor.md) instance’s [id](../arkit/worldanchor/id.md) property — and pose in a particular space. It’s your app’s responsibility to persist additional information, such as the meaning of each anchor. For example, you might save local data about a custom 3D lamp model that a person placed on their desk.

As a person moves from town-to-town or room-to-room, your app won’t receive all of the world anchor updates from each place someone used your app. Instead, the [anchorUpdates](../arkit/worldtrackingprovider/anchorupdates.md) sequence only provides world anchors for nearby objects.

### Track the device position in the world

Use the Compositor Services framework and the [WorldTrackingProvider](../arkit/worldtrackingprovider.md) class’s [queryDeviceAnchor(atTimestamp:)](../arkit/worldtrackingprovider/querydeviceanchor%28attimestamp_%29.md) method to get low-latency information about the current and future-predicted pose of the person’s device in world space.
