# Happy Beam

**Kind:** Sample Code  
**Availability:** visionOS 2.0+ · Xcode 16.0+

Leverage a Full Space to create a fun game using ARKit.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

In visionOS, you can create fun, dynamic games and apps using several different frameworks to create new kinds of spatial experiences: RealityKit, ARKit, SwiftUI, and Group Activities. This sample introduces Happy Beam, a game where you and your friends can hop on a FaceTime call and play together.

You’ll learn the mechanics of the game where grumpy clouds float around in the space, and people play by making a heart shape with their hands to project a beam. People aim the beam at the clouds to cheer them up, and a score counter keeps track of how well each player does cheering up the clouds.

## Design the game interface in SwiftUI

Most apps in visionOS launch as a window that opens different scene types depending on the needs of the app.

Here you see how Happy Beam presents a fun interface to people by using several SwiftUI views that display a welcome screen, a coaching screen that gives instructions, a scoreboard, and a game-ending screen.

**Welcome window**

![A screenshot showing the welcome screen window. It instructs people to cheer up grumpy clouds by shining a happy beam with your heart. There are two buttons: Play Solo and Play with Friends.](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.visionOS/HB-welcome@2x.png)

**Instructions**

![A screenshot showing the two input options in the game: Make a heart with two hands, or use a pinch gesture or a compatible device.](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.visionOS/HB-instructions@2x.png)

**Scoreboard**

![A screenshot showing the in-game scoreboard window with a backdrop of a living room populated by the game's grumpy clouds. The scoreboard shows the score, a back button, a mute button, a time left indicator, and a pause button.](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.visionOS/HB-scoreboard@2x.png)

**Ending window**

![A screenshot showing the final score window. It shows some happy clouds, how many clouds you cheered up, and has options for playing again and going back to the main menu.](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.visionOS/HB-ending@2x.png)

The following shows you the primary view in the app that displays each phase of gameplay:

```swift
struct HappyBeam: View {
    @Environment(\.openImmersiveSpace) private var openImmersiveSpace
    @Environment(GameModel.self) var gameModel
    
    @State private var session: GroupSession<HeartProjection>? = nil
    @State private var timer = Timer.publish(every: 1, on: .main, in: .common).autoconnect()
    @State private var subscriptions = Set<AnyCancellable>()
    
    var body: some View {
        let gameState = GameScreen.from(state: gameModel)
        VStack {
            Spacer()
            Group {
                switch gameState {
                case .start:
                    Start()
                case .soloPlay:
                    SoloPlay()
                case .lobby:
                    Lobby()
                case .soloScore:
                    SoloScore()
                case .multiPlay:
                    MultiPlay()
                case .multiScore:
                    MultiScore()
                }
            }
            .glassBackgroundEffect(
                in: RoundedRectangle(
                    cornerRadius: 32,
                    style: .continuous
                )
            )
        }
    }
}
```

When 3D content starts to appear, the game opens an immersive space to present content outside of the main window and in a person’s surroundings.

```swift
@main
struct HappyBeamApp: App {
    @State private var gameModel = GameModel()
    @State private var immersionState: ImmersionStyle = .mixed
    
    var body: some SwiftUI.Scene {
        WindowGroup("HappyBeam", id: "happyBeamApp") {
            HappyBeam()
                .environmentObject(gameModel)
        }
        .windowStyle(.plain)
        
        ImmersiveSpace(id: "happyBeam") {
            HappyBeamSpace(gestureModel: HeartGestureModelContainer.heartGestureModel)
                .environmentObject(gameModel)
        }
        .immersionStyle(selection: $immersionState, in: .mixed)
    }
}
```

The `HappyBeam` container view declares a dependency on `openImmersiveSpace`:

```swift
@Environment(\.openImmersiveSpace) private var openImmersiveSpace
```

It later uses that dependency to open the space from the app’s declaration when it’s time to start showing 3D content:

```swift
if gameModel.countDown == 0 {
    Task {
        await openImmersiveSpace(id: "happyBeam")
    }
}
```

<a id="Detect-a-heart-gesture-with-ARKit"></a>

## Detect a heart gesture with ARKit

The Happy Beam app recognizes the central *heart-shaped hands* gesture using ARKit’s support for 3D hand tracking in visionOS. Using hand tracking requires a running session and authorization from the wearer. It uses the `NSHandsTrackingUsageDescription` user info key to explain to players why the app requests permission for hand tracking.

![A screenshot showing someone making a heart gesture with their hands. A beam projects from the center of the player's hands and extends into a living room where grumpy clouds float toward the player.](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.visionOS/HB-custom-gestures@2x.png)

```swift
Task {
    do {
        try await session.run([handTrackingProvider])
    } catch {
        print("ARKitSession error:", error)
    }
}
```

Hand-tracking data isn’t available when your app is only displaying a window or volume. Instead, it’s available when you present an immersive space, as in the previous example.

You can detect gestures using ARKit data with a level of accuracy that depends on your use case and intended experience. For example, Happy Beam could require strict positioning of finger joints to closely resemble a heart shape. Instead, however, it prompts people to make a heart shape and uses a heuristic to indicate when the gesture is close enough.

The following checks whether a person’s thumbs and index fingers are almost touching:

```swift
// Get the position of all joints in world coordinates.
let originFromLeftHandThumbKnuckleTransform = matrix_multiply(
    leftHandAnchor.originFromAnchorTransform, leftHandThumbKnuckle.anchorFromJointTransform
).columns.3.xyz
let originFromLeftHandThumbTipTransform = matrix_multiply(
    leftHandAnchor.originFromAnchorTransform, leftHandThumbTipPosition.anchorFromJointTransform
).columns.3.xyz
let originFromLeftHandIndexFingerTipTransform = matrix_multiply(
    leftHandAnchor.originFromAnchorTransform, leftHandIndexFingerTip.anchorFromJointTransform
).columns.3.xyz
let originFromRightHandThumbKnuckleTransform = matrix_multiply(
    rightHandAnchor.originFromAnchorTransform, rightHandThumbKnuckle.anchorFromJointTransform
).columns.3.xyz
let originFromRightHandThumbTipTransform = matrix_multiply(
    rightHandAnchor.originFromAnchorTransform, rightHandThumbTipPosition.anchorFromJointTransform
).columns.3.xyz
let originFromRightHandIndexFingerTipTransform = matrix_multiply(
    rightHandAnchor.originFromAnchorTransform, rightHandIndexFingerTip.anchorFromJointTransform
).columns.3.xyz

let indexFingersDistance = distance(originFromLeftHandIndexFingerTipTransform, originFromRightHandIndexFingerTipTransform)
let thumbsDistance = distance(originFromLeftHandThumbTipTransform, originFromRightHandThumbTipTransform)

// Heart gesture detection is true when the distance between the index finger tips centers
// and the distance between the thumb tip centers is each less than four centimeters.
let isHeartShapeGesture = indexFingersDistance < 0.04 && thumbsDistance < 0.04
if !isHeartShapeGesture {
    return nil
}

// Compute a position in the middle of the heart gesture.
let halfway = (originFromRightHandIndexFingerTipTransform - originFromLeftHandThumbTipTransform) / 2
let heartMidpoint = originFromRightHandIndexFingerTipTransform - halfway

// Compute the vector from left thumb knuckle to right thumb knuckle and normalize (X axis).
let xAxis = normalize(originFromRightHandThumbKnuckleTransform - originFromLeftHandThumbKnuckleTransform)

// Compute the vector from right thumb tip to right index finger tip and normalize (Y axis).
let yAxis = normalize(originFromRightHandIndexFingerTipTransform - originFromRightHandThumbTipTransform)

let zAxis = normalize(cross(xAxis, yAxis))

// Create the final transform for the heart gesture from the three axes and midpoint vector.
let heartMidpointWorldTransform = simd_matrix(
    SIMD4(xAxis.x, xAxis.y, xAxis.z, 0),
    SIMD4(yAxis.x, yAxis.y, yAxis.z, 0),
    SIMD4(zAxis.x, zAxis.y, zAxis.z, 0),
    SIMD4(heartMidpoint.x, heartMidpoint.y, heartMidpoint.z, 1)
)
return heartMidpointWorldTransform
```

<a id="Support-several-kinds-of-input"></a>

## Support several kinds of input

To support accessibility features and general user preferences, include multiple kinds of input in an app that uses hand tracking as one form of input.

Happy Beam supports several kinds of input:

![A screenshot showing someone making a heart gesture with their hands. A beam projects from the center of the player's hands and extends into a living room where grumpy clouds float toward the player.](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.visionOS/HB-interactive-hands@2x.png)

![A screenshot showing a 3D heart perched on top of a tower that holds it.](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.visionOS/HB-turret@2x.png)

![A screenshot showing someone using VoiceOver to play Happy Beam. A picture-in-picture shows someone with their hands in their lap making the VoiceOver gesture to activate an element. In the game, one of the clouds displays a cheer up animation and VoiceOver highlights that cloud in a rectangle to show that it's the focused element.](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.visionOS/HB-accessibility@2x.png)

![A screenshot showing someone using a game controller to play Happy Beam.](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.visionOS/HB-controller@2x.png)

<a id="Display-3D-content-with-RealityKit"></a>

## Display 3D content with RealityKit

The 3D content in the app comes in the form of assets that you can export from Reality Composer Pro. You place each asset in the `RealityView` that represents your immersive space.

The following shows how Happy Beam generates clouds when the game starts, as well as materials for the floor-based beam projector. Because the game uses collision detection to keep score — the beam cheers up grumpy clouds when they collide — you make collision shapes for each model that might be involved.

```swift
@MainActor
func placeCloud(start: Point3D, end: Point3D, speed: Double) async throws -> Entity {
    let cloud = await loadFromRealityComposerPro(
        named: BundleAssets.cloudEntity,
        fromSceneNamed: BundleAssets.cloudScene
    )!
        .clone(recursive: true)
    
    cloud.generateCollisionShapes(recursive: true)
    cloud.components[PhysicsBodyComponent.self] = PhysicsBodyComponent()
    
    var accessibilityComponent = AccessibilityComponent()
    accessibilityComponent.label = "Cloud"
    accessibilityComponent.value = "Grumpy"
    accessibilityComponent.isAccessibilityElement = true
    accessibilityComponent.traits = [.button, .playsSound]
    accessibilityComponent.systemActions = [.activate]
    cloud.components[AccessibilityComponent.self] = accessibilityComponent
    
    let animation = cloudMovementAnimations[cloudPathsIndex]
    
    cloud.playAnimation(animation, transitionDuration: 1.0, startsPaused: false)
    cloudAnimate(cloud, kind: .sadBlink, shouldRepeat: false)
    spaceOrigin.addChild(cloud)
    
    return cloud
}
```

<a id="Add-SharePlay-support-for-multiplayer-gaming-experiences"></a>

## Add SharePlay support for multiplayer gaming experiences

You use the Group Activities framework in visionOS to support SharePlay during a FaceTime call. Happy Beam uses Group Activities to sync the score, active players list, and the position of each player’s projected beam.

> **Note**

> Developers using the [Apple Vision Pro developer kit](https://developer.apple.com/visionos/work-with-apple/) can test spatial SharePlay experiences on-device by installing the [Persona Preview Profile](https://developer.apple.com/download/all/?q=persona).

Use a reliable channel to send information that’s important to be correct, even if it can be slightly delayed as a result. The following shows how Happy Beam updates the game model’s score state in response to a score message:

```swift
sessionInfo.reliableMessenger = GroupSessionMessenger(session: newSession, deliveryMode: .reliable)

Task {
    for await (message, sender) in sessionInfo!.reliableMessenger!.messages(of: ScoreMessage.self) {
        gameModel.clouds[message.cloudID].isHappy = true
        gameModel
            .players
            .filter { $0.name == sender.source.id.asPlayerName }
            .first!
            .score += 1
    }
}
```

Use an unreliable messenger for sending data with low-latency requirements. Because the delivery mode is unreliable, some messages might not make it. Happy Beam uses the unreliable mode to send live updates to the position of the beam when each participant in the call chooses the Spatial option in FaceTime.

```swift
sessionInfo.messenger = GroupSessionMessenger(session: newSession, deliveryMode: .unreliable)
```

The following shows how Happy Beam serializes beam data for each message:

```swift
// Send each player's beam data during FaceTime calls where players have selected the Spatial option.
func sendBeamPositionUpdate(_ pose: Pose3D) {
    if let sessionInfo = sessionInfo, let session = sessionInfo.session, let messenger = sessionInfo.messenger {
        let everyoneElse = session.activeParticipants.subtracting([session.localParticipant])
        
        if isShowingBeam, gameModel.isSpatial {
            messenger.send(BeamMessage(pose: pose), to: .only(everyoneElse)) { error in
                if let error = error { print("Message failure:", error) }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
