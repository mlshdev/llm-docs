# deferQueryRequestToNetwork(completion:) (Swift)

**Framework:** SMS and Call Reporting  
**Kind:** Instance Method

## Declaration

```swift
func deferQueryRequestToNetwork(completion: @escaping @Sendable (ILNetworkResponse?, (any Error)?) -> Void)
```

```swift
func deferQueryRequestToNetwork() async throws -> ILNetworkResponse
```

## Parameters

- `completion`: A completion block that contains either the network response to the HTTPS request or an error.

## Discussion

When your Message Filter app extension calls this method to defer a query to its associated server, the system performs an HTTPS network request to a URL specified in the app extension’s `Info.plist` file. The system returns the response to that request (or an error) asynchronously in an [ILNetworkResponse](../ilnetworkresponse.md) object.

To make a network request on behalf of a Message Filter app extension, the system uses an HTTP `POST` request formatted in JSON, similar to the request shown below.

```
POST /server-endpoint HTTP/1.1
Accept: */*
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 148
```

Payload:

```json
{
    "_version": 1,
    "query": {
        "sender": "14085550001",
        "message": {
            "text": "This is a message"
        }
    },
    "app": {
        "version": "1.1"
    }
}
```
