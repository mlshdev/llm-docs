# Setting up the HTTP endpoints for Live Caller ID Lookup (Swift)

**Framework:** SMS and Call Reporting  
**Kind:** Article

Connect the on-device system to your server.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

For the Live Caller ID Lookup extension, your client-side app needs your [serviceURL](livecalleridlookupextensioncontext/serviceurl.md) so the system can fetch information from your server. Communication between the system and the server uses protocol buffer messages over HTTP. For more information, see [Homomorphic Encryption Protobuf](https://github.com/apple/swift-homomorphic-encryption-protobuf).

Implement your server with the following HTTP endpoints:

- `/config`
- `/key`
- `/queries`

<a id="Get-configuration-and-status"></a>

### Get configuration and status

The system calls the configuration endpoint periodically to get information about the use case configuration and evaluation key status. Set up the following `/config` endpoint by posting to `/config`:

| Request | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Header | `User-Identifier` | A pseudorandom identifier for the user. |
| Header | `Authorization` | The value that contains a private access token. |
| Request body | `ConfigRequest` | A serialized protocol buffer message. |
| Response | `ConfigResponse` | A serialized protocol buffer message. The `ConfigResponse` contains the `configs` and `key_info` response fields. |
| Response field | `configs` | A field that maps from the use case names to the corresponding configuration. |
| Response field | `key_info` | A list of the `KeyStatus` objects. |

<a id="Upload-the-evaluation-key"></a>

### Upload the evaluation key

You store the evaluation key on your server. When the system detects a new evaluation key, it uses the `/key` endpoint to upload it. Set up the following `/key` endpoint to upload an evaluation key by posting to `/key`:

| Request | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Header | `User-Identifier` | A pseudorandom identifier for the user. |
| Header | `Authorization` | The value that contains a private access token. |
| Request body | `EvaluationKeys` | A serialized protocol buffer message. |

<a id="Update-PIR-requests"></a>

### Update PIR requests

The system updates your private information retrieval (PIR) request through the `/queries` endpoint. Set up the `/queries` endpoint to evaluate PIR requests.

| Request | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Header | `User-Identifier` | A pseudorandom identifier for the user. This value looks up the previously stored evaluation key and uses it to evaluate the PIR request. |
| Header | `Authorization` | The value that contains a private access token. |
| Request body | `Requests` | A serialized protocol buffer message. |
| Response | `Responses` | A serialized protocol buffer message. |
