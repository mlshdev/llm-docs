## Discussion

An interstitial object defines a point within a `MediaItem` object where you can insert another media item; for example, a short ad. Each interstitial object in the array contains two keys: `starttime` and `duration`. The `starttime` is the length of time from the beginning of a media item, in seconds. The `duration` is the length of the interstitial, in seconds. Both keys are required. A common use for these objects is to define when and where ads are to be played during a stream. [Listing 1](1627341-interstitials.md#1943545) shows a complete TVMLKit JS example for incorporating interstitials. A single interstitial is defined. In addition, an event listener is created that prevents users from fast-forwarding or rewinding during the duration of the interstitial.

interstitials.js example

```javascript
var baseURL;
 
App.onLaunch = function(options) {
    baseURL = options.BASEURL;
    var documentPath = "path to file on server/baseball.m3u8";
    var videourl = baseURL + documentPath;
 
    var singleVideo = new MediaItem('video', videourl);
    var videoInterstitials = [];
    videoInterstitials.push({
        starttime: 30,
        duration: 20
    });
    singleVideo.interstitials = videoInterstitials;
    var videoList = new Playlist();
    videoList.push(singleVideo);
    var myPlayer = new Player();
    myPlayer.playlist = videoList;
    myPlayer.addEventListener("requestSeekToTime", function(event) {
        if (event.currentTime > 30 && event.currentTime <50) {return false;} else {return true;}
        });
    myPlayer.play();
}
 
App.onExit = function() {
    console.log("exited");
}
```
