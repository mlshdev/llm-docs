# loadindexes

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** TVMLKit JS  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** tvOS 13.0+

An event type that tells the data source to load its indexes.

## Declaration

```
attribute  loadindexes;
```

<a id="discussion"></a>

## Discussion

This event gets triggered when TVMLKit recognizes that the `DataSource` needs to load more indexes. TVMLKit invokes the event when there are visible cells onscreen consisting of incomplete data segments. For example, when the `DataSource` is set up to support lazy loading of data and it begins to request uninitialized objects, this event is triggered.

The `loadIndexes` event contains its `DataSource `object` `as the target, as well as a `request` property, which is a [LoadIndexesRequest](../../loadindexesrequest.md) object.
