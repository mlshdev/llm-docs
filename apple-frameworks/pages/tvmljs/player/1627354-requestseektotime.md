<a id="discussion"></a>

## Discussion

This event is called after the left or right edge of the Siri Remote is pressed and released. Use [shouldHandleStateChange](1627428-shouldhandlestatechange.md) for press and hold events.

Only a single `requestSeekToTime` listener can be active at a time. If multiple listeners are set to listen for `requestSeekToTime`, only the last one will be updated. The listener is passed an event object with the following attributes:

- `currentTime`—The current playback time in seconds.
- `requestedTime`—The requested playback time in seconds.
- `target`—The event object, which is the [Player](../player.md) object.
- `timeStamp`—The time that the event occurred.
- `type`—The name of the event.

The listener must return one of the following values:

- `true`. The seek performed as requested.
- `false` or `null`. The seek was not performed.
- An integer value. The seek will be performed to the stated value and not the initial requested value.
