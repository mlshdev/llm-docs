# CFHostScheduleWithRunLoop(\_:\_:\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** CFNetwork  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** iOS 2.0+ (deprecated in 27.0) · iPadOS 2.0+ (deprecated in 27.0) · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ (deprecated in 27.0) · macOS 10.3+ (deprecated in 27.0) · tvOS 9.0+ (deprecated in 27.0) · visionOS 1.0+ (deprecated in 27.0)

Schedules a CFHost on a run loop.

> Use Network framework instead, see deprecation notice in \<CFNetwork/CFHost.h\>

## Declaration

```swift
func CFHostScheduleWithRunLoop(_ theHost: CFHost, _ runLoop: CFRunLoop, _ runLoopMode: CFString)
```

## Parameters

- `theHost`: The host to be schedule on a run loop. This value must not be `NULL`.
- `runLoop`: The run loop on which to schedule `theHost`. This value must not be `NULL`.
- `runLoopMode`: The mode on which to schedule `theHost`. This value must not be `NULL`.

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

Schedules `theHost` on a run loop, which causes resolutions of the host to be performed asynchronously. The caller is responsible for ensuring that at least one of the run loops on which the host is scheduled is being run.

<a id="Special-Considerations"></a>

### Special Considerations

This function is thread safe.
