# AVCaptureColorSpace (Swift)

**Framework:** AVFoundation  
**Kind:** Enumeration  
**Availability:** iOS 10.0+ · iPadOS 10.0+ · Mac Catalyst 14.0+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 17.0+

An enumeration of color spaces a device can support.

## Declaration

```swift
enum AVCaptureColorSpace
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

By default, a capture session automatically enables wide-gamut capture for supported devices and capture workflows.

## Topics

### Color spaces

- [AVCaptureColorSpace.sRGB](avcapturecolorspace/srgb.md): The standard RGB color space.
- [AVCaptureColorSpace.P3_D65](avcapturecolorspace/p3_d65.md): The P3 D65 wide color space that uses Illuminant D65 as the white point.
- [AVCaptureColorSpace.HLG_BT2020](avcapturecolorspace/hlg_bt2020.md): The BT.2020 wide color space that uses Illuminant D65 as the white point and Hybrid Log-Gamma (HLG) as the transfer function.
- [AVCaptureColorSpace.appleLog](avcapturecolorspace/applelog.md): The Apple Log Color space, which uses BT2020 as the color primaries, and an Apple-defined Log curve as a transfer function.
- [AVCaptureColorSpace.appleLog2](avcapturecolorspace/applelog2.md): The Apple Log 2 Color space, which uses Apple Gamut as the color primaries, and an Apple defined Log curve as a transfer function. When you set this as the active color space on an [AVCaptureDevice](avcapturedevice.md), any [AVCapturePhotoOutput](avcapturephotooutput.md) or [AVCaptureStillImageOutput](avcapturestillimageoutput.md) connected to the same [AVCaptureDevice](avcapturedevice.md) is made inactive (its [isActive](avcaptureconnection/isactive.md) property returns `false`).
