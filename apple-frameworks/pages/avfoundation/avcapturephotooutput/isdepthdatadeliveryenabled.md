# isDepthDataDeliveryEnabled (Swift)

**Framework:** AVFoundation  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 11.0+ · iPadOS 11.0+ · Mac Catalyst 14.0+ · tvOS 17.0+

A Boolean value that specifies whether to configure the capture pipeline for depth data capture.

## Declaration

```swift
var isDepthDataDeliveryEnabled: Bool { get set }
```

## Discussion

Depth data captures a per-pixel map of scene depth information delivered alongside the photo image and optionally embedded in image file output. Depth data can be used for purposes such as applying depth-sensitive photo filter effects (like that seen in the iOS Camera app’s Portrait mode) and performing computer vision tasks.

Capturing depth data requires that a capture session set up its internal rendering pipeline differently. If you intend to capture depth data at all, set this property to [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true) before calling the [AVCaptureSession](../avcapturesession.md) [startRunning()](../avcapturesession/startrunning%28%29.md) method. Changing this property while the session is running requires a lengthy reconfiguration of the capture render pipeline: Live Photo captures in progress will end immediately, unfulfilled photo requests will abort, and video preview will temporarily freeze.

You must enable this option before initiating a photo capture with the [isDepthDataDeliveryEnabled](../avcapturephotosettings/isdepthdatadeliveryenabled.md) property of your photo settings object set to [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true). However, after you’ve enabled this option, you are free to issue photo capture requests both with and without depth data.
