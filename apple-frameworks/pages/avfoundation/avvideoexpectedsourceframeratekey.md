# AVVideoExpectedSourceFrameRateKey (Swift)

**Framework:** AVFoundation  
**Kind:** Global Variable  
**Availability:** iOS 7.0+ · iPadOS 7.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.10+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

The expected source frame rate.

## Declaration

```swift
let AVVideoExpectedSourceFrameRateKey: String
```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

This is not used to control the frame rate; it is provided as a hint to the video encoder so that it can set up internal configuration before compression begins. The actual frame rate  depends on frame duration and may vary. This should be set if an auto level [AVVideoProfileLevelKey](avvideoprofilelevelkey.md) is used, or if the source content has a high frame rate higher than 30 fps. The encoder might have to drop frames to satisfy bit stream requirements if this key is not specified.

### Frame rate

- [AVVideoAverageNonDroppableFrameRateKey](avvideoaveragenondroppableframeratekey.md): The desired average number of non-droppable frames to be encoded for each second of video.
