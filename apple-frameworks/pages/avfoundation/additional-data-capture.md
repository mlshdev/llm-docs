# Additional data capture (Swift)

**Framework:** AVFoundation  
**Kind:** API Collection

Capture additional data including depth and metadata, and synchronize capture from multiple outputs.

## Topics

### Depth data capture

- [Capturing photos with depth](capturing-photos-with-depth.md): Get a depth map with a photo to create effects like the system camera’s Portrait mode (on compatible devices).
- [Creating auxiliary depth data manually](creating-auxiliary-depth-data-manually.md): Generate a depth image and attach it to your own image.
- [Capturing depth using the LiDAR camera](capturing-depth-using-the-lidar-camera.md): Access the LiDAR camera on supporting devices to capture precise depth data.
- [AVCamFilter: Applying filters to a capture stream](avcamfilter-applying-filters-to-a-capture-stream.md): Render a capture stream with rose-colored filtering and depth effects.
- [Streaming depth data from the TrueDepth camera](streaming-depth-data-from-the-truedepth-camera.md): Visualize depth data in 2D and 3D from the TrueDepth camera.
- [Enhancing live video by leveraging TrueDepth camera data](enhancing-live-video-by-leveraging-truedepth-camera-data.md): Apply your own background to a live capture feed streamed from the front-facing TrueDepth camera.
- [AVCaptureDepthDataOutput](avcapturedepthdataoutput.md): A capture output that records scene depth information on compatible camera devices.
- [AVDepthData](avdepthdata.md): A container for per-pixel distance or disparity information captured by compatible camera devices.
- [AVCameraCalibrationData](avcameracalibrationdata.md): Information about the camera characteristics used to capture images and depth data.

### Metadata capture

- [AVCaptureMetadataInput](avcapturemetadatainput.md): A capture input for providing timed metadata to a capture session.
- [AVCaptureMetadataOutput](avcapturemetadataoutput.md): A capture output for processing timed metadata produced by a capture session.
- [AVMetadataObject](avmetadataobject.md): The abstract superclass for objects provided by a metadata capture output.
- [Metadata types](metadata-types.md): Inspect the supported metadata object types that the framework supports.

### Synchronized capture

- [AVCaptureDataOutputSynchronizer](avcapturedataoutputsynchronizer.md): An object that coordinates time-matched delivery of data from multiple capture outputs.
- [AVCaptureSynchronizedDataCollection](avcapturesynchronizeddatacollection.md): A set of data samples collected simultaneously from multiple capture outputs.
- [AVCaptureSynchronizedSampleBufferData](avcapturesynchronizedsamplebufferdata.md): A container for video or audio samples collected using synchronized capture.
- [AVCaptureSynchronizedMetadataObjectData](avcapturesynchronizedmetadataobjectdata.md): A container for metadata objects collected using synchronized capture.
- [AVCaptureSynchronizedDepthData](avcapturesynchronizeddepthdata.md): A container for scene depth information collected using synchronized capture.
- [AVCaptureSynchronizedData](avcapturesynchronizeddata.md): The abstract superclass for media samples collected using synchronized capture.

### Capture

- [Capture setup](capture-setup.md): Configure built-in cameras and microphones, and external capture devices, for media capture.
- [Photo capture](photo-capture.md): Capture high-quality still images, Live Photos, and supporting photo data.
- [Audio and video capture](audio-and-video-capture.md): Capture audio and video directly to media files, or capture streams of media for direct access to media sample buffers.
