# switchBitrate (Swift)

**Framework:** AVFoundation  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 7.0+ · iPadOS 7.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.9+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 1.0+

The bandwidth value that causes a switch, up or down, in the item’s quality being played.

## Declaration

```swift
var switchBitrate: Double { get }
```

## Discussion

The value of the property is negative if unknown.

Corresponds to “c-switch-bitrate”.

This property is not compatible with key-value observing.
