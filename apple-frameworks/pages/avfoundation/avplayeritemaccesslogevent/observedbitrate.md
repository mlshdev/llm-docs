# observedBitrate (Swift)

**Framework:** AVFoundation  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 4.3+ · iPadOS 4.3+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.7+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 1.0+

The empirical throughput, in bits per second, across all media downloaded.

## Declaration

```swift
var observedBitrate: Double { get }
```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

The property corresponds to “c-observed-bitrate”.

The value of this property is negative if unknown.

This property is not compatible with key-value observing.
