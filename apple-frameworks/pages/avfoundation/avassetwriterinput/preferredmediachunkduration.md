# preferredMediaChunkDuration (Swift)

**Framework:** AVFoundation  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ · iPadOS 8.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.10+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

The duration to use for each chunk of sample data in the output file.

## Declaration

```swift
var preferredMediaChunkDuration: CMTime { get set }
```

## Discussion

This property supports file types that support media chunk alignment, such as QuickTime Movie files. Chunk duration can influence the granularity of the I/O the system performs when reading a media file; for example, during playback. A larger chunk duration can result in fewer reads from disk, at the potential expense of a higher memory footprint.

A chunk contains one or more samples. The total duration of the samples in a chunk is no greater than the preferred chunk duration, or the duration of a single sample if the sample’s duration is greater than this preferred chunk duration.

The default value is [invalid](../../coremedia/cmtime/invalid.md), which means that the input chooses an appropriate default value. It’s an error to set a chunk duration that’s negative or nonnumeric.

You can’t set this value after writing starts.
