# navigationMarkerGroups (Swift)

**Framework:** AVFoundation

```

## Discussion

A navigation marker group provides a set of time markers for navigating playback. The most common form of navigation marker group is a chapter list; however, you can also provide other sets of markers to allow a user to jump to significant events in the presentation. For example, a “Goals Scored” marker group might summarize key moments in a recorded sporting event. When you present a player item containing marker groups with the [AVPlayerViewController](../../avkit/avplayerviewcontroller.md) class, the user interface provides options for navigating each group.

To provide a chapter list, use the first item in the [navigationMarkerGroups](navigationmarkergroups.md) array and set its title property to `nil`. To provide additional or alternate means of navigating content, use a unique title value for each navigation marker group in the array.
