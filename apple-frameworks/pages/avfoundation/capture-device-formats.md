# Formats (Swift)

**Framework:** AVFoundation  
**Kind:** API Collection

Configure capture formats and camera frame rates.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

The following code example illustrates how to select an iOS device’s highest possible frame rate:

```swift
func configureCameraForHighestFrameRate(device: AVCaptureDevice) {
    
    var bestFormat: AVCaptureDevice.Format?
    var bestFrameRateRange: AVFrameRateRange?

    for format in device.formats {
        for range in format.videoSupportedFrameRateRanges {
            if range.maxFrameRate > bestFrameRateRange?.maxFrameRate ?? 0 {
                bestFormat = format
                bestFrameRateRange = range
            }
        }
    }
    
    if let bestFormat = bestFormat, 
       let bestFrameRateRange = bestFrameRateRange {
        do {
            try device.lockForConfiguration()
            
            // Set the device's active format.
            device.activeFormat = bestFormat
            
            // Set the device's min/max frame duration.
            let duration = bestFrameRateRange.minFrameDuration
            device.activeVideoMinFrameDuration = duration
            device.activeVideoMaxFrameDuration = duration
            
            device.unlockForConfiguration()
        } catch {
            // Handle error.
        }
    }
}
```

Most common configurations of capture settings are available through the [AVCaptureSession](avcapturesession.md) object and its available presets. However, on iOS devices, some specialized options (such as high frame rate) require directly setting a capture format on an [AVCaptureDevice](avcapturedevice.md) instance.

> **Note**

>  In iOS, directly configuring a capture device’s [activeFormat](avcapturedevice/activeformat.md) property changes the capture session’s preset to [inputPriority](avcapturesession/preset/inputpriority.md). Upon making this change, the capture session no longer automatically configures the capture format when you call the [startRunning()](avcapturesession/startrunning%28%29.md) method or call the [commitConfiguration()](avcapturesession/commitconfiguration%28%29.md) method after changing the session topology.
>
> In macOS, a capture session can still automatically configure the capture format after you make changes. To prevent automatic changes to the capture format in macOS, follow the advice listed under the [lockForConfiguration()](avcapturedevice/lockforconfiguration%28%29.md) method.

## Topics

### Configuring capture formats

- [formats](avcapturedevice/formats.md): The capture formats a device supports.
- [activeFormat](avcapturedevice/activeformat.md): The capture format in use by the device.
- [activeDepthDataFormat](avcapturedevice/activedepthdataformat.md): The currently active depth data format of the capture device.
- [AVCaptureDevice.Format](avcapturedevice/format.md): A class that defines media formats and capture settings that capture devices support.

### Configuring frame durations

- [activeVideoMinFrameDuration](avcapturedevice/activevideominframeduration.md): The currently active minimum frame duration.
- [activeVideoMaxFrameDuration](avcapturedevice/activevideomaxframeduration.md): The currently active maximum frame duration.
- [activeDepthDataMinFrameDuration](avcapturedevice/activedepthdataminframeduration.md): The minimum frame duration of depth data.

### Configuring camera hardware

- [lockForConfiguration()](avcapturedevice/lockforconfiguration%28%29.md): Requests exclusive access to configure device hardware properties.
- [unlockForConfiguration()](avcapturedevice/unlockforconfiguration%28%29.md): Releases exclusive control over device hardware properties.
- [isSubjectAreaChangeMonitoringEnabled](avcapturedevice/issubjectareachangemonitoringenabled.md): A Boolean value that indicates whether the device monitors the subject area for changes.
- [subjectAreaDidChangeNotification](avcapturedevice/subjectareadidchangenotification.md): A notification the system posts when a capture device detects a substantial change to the video subject area.
- [Focus](capture-device-focus.md): Configure the automatic focus behavior of a camera, or manually set its lens position.
- [Exposure](capture-device-exposure.md): Configure the automatic exposure behavior of a camera, or manually control its exposure settings.
- [White balance](capture-device-white-balance.md): Configure the automatic white balance behavior of a camera, or manually control white balance settings.
- [Lighting](capture-device-lighting.md): Configure the device flash, torch, and low light settings.
- [Color](capture-device-color.md): Manage HDR and color space settings for a device.
- [Zoom](capture-device-zoom.md): Configure device zooming behavior and inspect hardware capabilities.
