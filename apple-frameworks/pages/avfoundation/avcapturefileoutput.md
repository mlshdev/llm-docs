# AVCaptureFileOutput (Swift)

**Framework:** AVFoundation  
**Kind:** Class  
**Availability:** iOS 4.0+ · iPadOS 4.0+ · Mac Catalyst 14.0+ · macOS 10.7+ · tvOS 17.0+

The abstract superclass for capture outputs that can record captured data to a file.

## Declaration

```swift
class AVCaptureFileOutput
```

## Topics

### Setting file output properties

- [delegate](avcapturefileoutput/delegate.md): The delegate object for the capture file output.
- [maxRecordedDuration](avcapturefileoutput/maxrecordedduration.md): The longest duration allowed for the recording.
- [maxRecordedFileSize](avcapturefileoutput/maxrecordedfilesize.md): The maximum size, in bytes, of the data that should be recorded by the receiver.
- [minFreeDiskSpaceLimit](avcapturefileoutput/minfreediskspacelimit.md): The minimum amount of free space, in bytes, required for recording to continue on a given volume.
- [outputFileURL](avcapturefileoutput/outputfileurl.md): The URL to which output is directed.
- [recordedDuration](avcapturefileoutput/recordedduration.md): Indicates the duration of the media recorded to the current output file.
- [recordedFileSize](avcapturefileoutput/recordedfilesize.md): Indicates the size, in bytes, of the data recorded to the current output file.
- [isRecording](avcapturefileoutput/isrecording.md): Indicates whether recording is in progress.
- [isRecordingPaused](avcapturefileoutput/isrecordingpaused.md): Indicates whether recording to the current output file is paused.

### Managing recording

- [startRecording(to:recordingDelegate:)](avcapturefileoutput/startrecording%28to_recordingdelegate_%29.md): Starts recording media to the specified output URL.
- [stopRecording()](avcapturefileoutput/stoprecording%28%29.md): Tells the receiver to stop recording to the current file.
- [pauseRecording()](avcapturefileoutput/pauserecording%28%29.md): Pauses recording to the current output file.
- [resumeRecording()](avcapturefileoutput/resumerecording%28%29.md): Resumes recording to the current output file after it was previously paused using [pauseRecording()](avcapturefileoutput/pauserecording%28%29.md).
