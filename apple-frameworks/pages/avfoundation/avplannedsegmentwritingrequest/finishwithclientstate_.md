### Managing client state

- [clientStateToRestore](clientstatetorestore.md): The client state persisted from the previous segment, if any. Specifically, this is the NSData provided to the previous segment’s finishWithClientState: method. The client is responsible to restore its client state before writing the current segment. For example, clients such as compositors with a temporal element may need some processing history of previous samples in order to generate an output sample at time N. This will be nil for algorithms that are stateless.
