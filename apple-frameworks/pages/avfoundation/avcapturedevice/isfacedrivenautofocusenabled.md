# isFaceDrivenAutoFocusEnabled (Swift)

**Framework:** AVFoundation  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 15.4+ · iPadOS 15.4+ · Mac Catalyst 15.4+ · tvOS 17.0+

A Boolean value that indicates whether the device has face-driven autofocus enabled.

## Declaration

```swift
var isFaceDrivenAutoFocusEnabled: Bool { get set }
```

## Discussion

Face-driven auto focus takes a subject’s face into account when adjusting auto focus. For apps that link against iOS 15.4 or later, the value of this property defaults to [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true) for devices that support auto focus.

Before setting a value for this property, perform the following:

- Obtain exclusive access to the device by calling its [lockForConfiguration()](lockforconfiguration%28%29.md) method.
- Set the value of the device’s [automaticallyAdjustsFaceDrivenAutoFocusEnabled](automaticallyadjustsfacedrivenautofocusenabled.md) property to [false](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false).

Attempting to set a value before performing these steps results in an exception.

When you finish configuring the device, unlock it by calling its [unlockForConfiguration()](unlockforconfiguration%28%29.md) method.

> **Important**

>  Updating the state of this property doesn’t initiate a focus change. After setting a new value, set an appropriate [focusMode](focusmode-swift.property.md) to apply the change.
