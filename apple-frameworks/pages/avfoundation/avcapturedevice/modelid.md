# modelID (Swift)

**Framework:** AVFoundation  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 4.0+ · iPadOS 4.0+ · Mac Catalyst 14.0+ · macOS 10.7+ · tvOS 17.0+ · visionOS 2.1+

A model identifier for the device.

## Declaration

```swift
var modelID: String { get }
```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

The value of this property is an identifier unique to all devices of the same model. The value is persistent across device connections and disconnections, and across different systems. For example, the model identifier of a built-in camera on two identical iPhone models is the same even though they’re different physical devices.
