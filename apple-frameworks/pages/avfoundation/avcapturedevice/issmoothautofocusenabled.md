# isSmoothAutoFocusEnabled (Swift)

**Framework:** AVFoundation  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 7.0+ · iPadOS 7.0+ · Mac Catalyst 14.0+ · tvOS 17.0+

A Boolean value that indicates whether smooth autofocus is in an enabled state on the device.

## Declaration

```swift
var isSmoothAutoFocusEnabled: Bool { get set }
```

## Discussion

On capable devices, you can enable a focusing mode in which the camera makes lens movements more slowly. This mode make focus transitions less visually intrusive, a behavior that you may want for video capture.

Before changing the value of this property, you must call [lockForConfiguration()](lockforconfiguration%28%29.md) to acquire exclusive access to the device’s configuration properties. Otherwise, setting the value of this property raises an exception. When you finish configuring the device, call [unlockForConfiguration()](unlockforconfiguration%28%29.md) to release the lock and allow other devices to configure the settings.
