# samplesRequiredForDecoderRefresh (Swift)

**Framework:** AVFoundation  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 16.0+ · iPadOS 16.0+ · Mac Catalyst 16.0+ · macOS 10.11+ · tvOS 16.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 9.0+

The number of samples prior to the current sample, in decode order, the decoder requires to achieve a coherent output at the current decode time.

## Declaration

```swift
var samplesRequiredForDecoderRefresh: Int { get }
```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

This property value is 0 when the decoder doesn’t require samples for refresh or when the track doesn’t contain this information.

Some sample sequences don’t indicate sample dependencies and instead indicate to decode a specific sample with all available accuracy. The system must decode samples in decode order before decoding the specific sample.
