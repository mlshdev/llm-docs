# AVPlayerItemSampleBufferOutput (Swift)

**Framework:** AVFoundation  
**Kind:** Class  
**Availability:** iOS 27.0+ · iPadOS 27.0+ · Mac Catalyst 27.0+ · macOS 27.0+ · tvOS 27.0+ · visionOS 27.0+ · watchOS 27.0+

[AVPlayerItemSampleBufferOutput](avplayeritemsamplebufferoutput.md) delivers `CMSampleBuffers` for [AVPlayerItem](avplayeritem.md) playback.

## Declaration

```swift
class AVPlayerItemSampleBufferOutput
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Playback only happens when the [AVPlayerItem](avplayeritem.md) is the current item of its [AVPlayer](avplayer.md).

Create an [AVPlayerItemSampleBufferOutput](avplayeritemsamplebufferoutput.md) with a [AVPlayerItemSampleBufferOutputAudioConfiguration](avplayeritemsamplebufferoutputaudioconfiguration.md) to configure it to deliver `CMSampleBuffers` containing the decoded audio, and attach it to the [AVPlayerItem](avplayeritem.md) using `-[AVPlayerItem addOutput:]`; the audio will be in the format specified by the configuration object’s `requestedAudioFormat`.

Note that [AVPlayerItemSampleBufferOutput](avplayeritemsamplebufferoutput.md) may be used to pull `CMSampleBuffers` far ahead of the current play time.  Practical use requires clients to monitor the item timebase time, and pause pulling when they have received CMSampleBuffers sufficient to prepare for near-term-future playback or processing.

Marker-only `CMSampleBuffers` may be among those returned; you can detect and skip these by testing whether `CMSampleBufferGetNumSamples(sampleBuffer) == 0`.

The output `CMSampleBuffers` will have appropriate OutputPresentationTimeStamps for playback, but beyond that, synchronizing presentation to the AVPlayerItem’s timebase is entirely up to the client.

Currently supported for HLS `AVPlayerItems` only, and only for delivering decoded PCM audio.

## Topics

### Creating a sample buffer output

- [init(configuration:)](avplayeritemsamplebufferoutput/init%28configuration_%29.md): Initializes an instance of [AVPlayerItemSampleBufferOutput](avplayeritemsamplebufferoutput.md).

### Retrieving sample buffers

- [nextAvailableSampleBuffer()](avplayeritemsamplebufferoutput/nextavailablesamplebuffer%28%29.md): Returns the next sample buffer if it is already available.
- [nextSampleBuffer()](avplayeritemsamplebufferoutput/nextsamplebuffer%28%29.md): Returns next sample buffer once it becomes available.
- [AVPlayerItemSampleBufferOutput.SampleBufferInSequence](avplayeritemsamplebufferoutput/samplebufferinsequence.md): Holds the information necessary for processing generated sample buffers.
