# videoMinFrameDurationOverride (Swift)

**Framework:** AVFoundation  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 14.0+ · tvOS 17.0+

A time value that acts as a modifier to a capture device’s active video minimum frame duration.

## Declaration

```swift
var videoMinFrameDurationOverride: CMTime { get set }
```

## Discussion

A capture device’s [activeVideoMinFrameDuration](../avcapturedevice/activevideominframeduration.md) property is the reciprocal of its active maximum frame rate. To limit the maximum frame rate of the capture device, you may set [activeVideoMinFrameDuration](../avcapturedevice/activevideominframeduration.md) to a value supported by the device’s [activeFormat](../avcapturedevice/activeformat.md). Changes you make to the device’s [activeVideoMinFrameDuration](../avcapturedevice/activevideominframeduration.md) value take effect immediately without disrupting preview. Therefore, [AVCaptureSession](../avcapturesession.md) must always allocate sufficient resources to allow the device to run at its active format’s maximum frame rate.

If you wish to use a particular device format but run it only at lower frame rates (for instance, only run a 1080p240 fps format at a maximum frame rate of 60), set the input’s [videoMinFrameDurationOverride](videominframedurationoverride.md) property to the reciprocal of the maximum frame rate you intend to use before starting the session (or within a [beginConfiguration()](../avcapturesession/beginconfiguration%28%29.md) / [commitConfiguration()](../avcapturesession/commitconfiguration%28%29.md) block while running the session).

This property’s default value is [invalid](../../coremedia/cmtime/invalid.md). When you remove a device input from a session and then add it back, this property reverts to its default value.
