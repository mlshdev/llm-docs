# isCinematicVideoCaptureSupported (Swift)

**Framework:** AVFoundation  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 26.0+ · iPadOS 26.0+ · Mac Catalyst 26.0+ · macOS 26.0+ · tvOS 26.0+

A BOOL value specifying whether Cinematic Video capture is supported.

## Declaration

```swift
var isCinematicVideoCaptureSupported: Bool { get }
```

## Discussion

With Cinematic Video capture, you get a simulated depth-of-field effect that keeps your subjects (people, pets, and more) in sharp focus while applying a pleasing blur to the background (or foreground). Depending on the focus mode (see [AVCaptureDevice.CinematicVideoFocusMode](../avcapturedevice/cinematicvideofocusmode.md) for detail), the camera either uses machine learning to automatically detect and focus on subjects in the scene, or it fixes focus on a subject until it exits the scene. Cinematic Videos can be played back and edited using the Cinematic framework.

You can adjust the video’s simulated aperture before starting a recording using the [simulatedAperture](simulatedaperture.md) property. With Cinematic Video specific focus methods on [AVCaptureDevice](../avcapturedevice.md), you can dynamically control focus transitions.

Movie files captured with Cinematic Video enabled can be played back and edited with the \[Cinematic framework\] (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/cinematic/playing-and-editing-cinematic-mode-video?language=objc).

This property returns `true` if the session’s current configuration allows Cinematic Video capture. When switching cameras or formats, this property may change. When this property changes from `true` to `false`, [isCinematicVideoCaptureEnabled](iscinematicvideocaptureenabled.md) also reverts to `false`. If you’ve previously opted in for Cinematic Video capture and then change configuration, you may need to set [isCinematicVideoCaptureEnabled](iscinematicvideocaptureenabled.md) to `true` again. This property is key-value observable.

> **Note**

> [AVCaptureDepthDataOutput](../avcapturedepthdataoutput.md) is not supported when [isCinematicVideoCaptureEnabled](iscinematicvideocaptureenabled.md) is set to `true`. Running an [AVCaptureSession](../avcapturesession.md) with both of these features throws an `NSInvalidArgumentException`.
