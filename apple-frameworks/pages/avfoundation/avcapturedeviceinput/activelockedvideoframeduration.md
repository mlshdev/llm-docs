# activeLockedVideoFrameDuration (Swift)

**Framework:** AVFoundation  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 26.0+ · iPadOS 26.0+ · Mac Catalyst 26.0+ · macOS 26.0+ · tvOS 26.0+

The receiver’s locked frame duration (the reciprocal of its frame rate). Setting this property guarantees the intra-frame duration delivered by the device input is precisely the frame duration you request.

## Declaration

```swift
var activeLockedVideoFrameDuration: CMTime { get set }
```

## Discussion

Set this property to run the receiver’s associated [AVCaptureDevice](../avcapturedevice.md) at precisely your provided frame rate (expressed as a duration). Query [minSupportedLockedVideoFrameDuration](../avcapturedevice/minsupportedlockedvideoframeduration.md) to find the minimum value supported by this [AVCaptureDeviceInput](../avcapturedeviceinput.md). In order to disable locked video frame duration, set this property to `kCMTimeInvalid`. This property resets itself to `kCMTimeInvalid` when the receiver’s attached [activeFormat](../avcapturedevice/activeformat.md) changes. When you set this property, its value is also reflected in the receiver’s [activeVideoMinFrameDuration](../avcapturedevice/activevideominframeduration.md) and [activeVideoMaxFrameDuration](../avcapturedevice/activevideomaxframeduration.md).

> **Note**

> Locked frame duration availability may change depending on the device configuration. For example, locked frame duration is unsupported when [isAutoVideoFrameRateEnabled](../avcapturedevice/isautovideoframerateenabled.md) or [isSpatialVideoCaptureEnabled](../avcapturemoviefileoutput/isspatialvideocaptureenabled.md) is set to `true`.

> **Note**

> Only one [AVCaptureDeviceInput](../avcapturedeviceinput.md) added to an [AVCaptureMultiCamSession](../avcapturemulticamsession.md) can follow an external sync device or run at a locked frame duration.

> **Note**

> Setting this property may cause a lengthy reconfiguration of the receiver, similar to setting [activeFormat](../avcapturedevice/activeformat.md) or [sessionPreset](../avcapturesession/sessionpreset.md).

> **Note**

> When using this property, set the exposure duration with [setExposureModeCustom(duration:iso:completionHandler:)](../avcapturedevice/setexposuremodecustom%28duration_iso_completionhandler_%29.md) to one half the frame duration (or less) to maintain full dynamic range.

> **Important**

> If you set this property to a valid value while the receiver’s [minSupportedLockedVideoFrameDuration](../avcapturedevice/minsupportedlockedvideoframeduration.md) is `kCMTimeInvalid`, it throws an `NSInvalidArgumentException`.

> **Important**

> If you set this property while the receiver’s  [isLockedVideoFrameDurationSupported](islockedvideoframedurationsupported.md) property returns `false`, it throws an `NSInvalidArgumentException`.
