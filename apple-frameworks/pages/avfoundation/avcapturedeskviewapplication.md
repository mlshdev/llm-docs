let configuration = AVCaptureDeskViewApplication.LaunchConfiguration()

// Use the previously set frame.
configuration.mainWindowFrame = .zero

// Execute the completion handler when the user starts Desk View.
configuration.requiresSetUpModeCompletion = true

// Launch Desk View with a configuration and completion handler.
deskView.present(launchConfiguration: configuration) { error in
    // Perform error handling and additional tasks.
}
```
