# isHighResolutionPhotoEnabled (Swift)

**Framework:** AVFoundation  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 10.0+ (deprecated in 16.0) · iPadOS 10.0+ (deprecated in 16.0) · Mac Catalyst 14.0+ (deprecated in 16.0) · macOS 10.15+ (deprecated in 13.0)

A Boolean value that specifies whether to capture still images at the highest resolution supported by the active device and format.

> Use maxPhotoDimensions instead.

## Declaration

```swift
var isHighResolutionPhotoEnabled: Bool { get set }
```

## Discussion

When this setting is [false](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false) (the default), a photo capture output delivers images with the dimensions specified by the [formatDescription](../avcapturedevice/format/formatdescription.md) property of the source [AVCaptureDevice](../avcapturedevice.md) object’s active capture format. However, some devices and capture formats allow for still image capture at resolutions higher than their video capture (and streaming photo preview) resolution. To capture the highest possible resolution for still photos (described by the capture format’s [highResolutionStillImageDimensions](../avcapturedevice/format/highresolutionstillimagedimensions.md) property), change this setting to [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true).

If any output connected to your capture session enables video stabilization (see the [AVCaptureConnection](../avcaptureconnection.md) [preferredVideoStabilizationMode](../avcaptureconnection/preferredvideostabilizationmode.md) property), captured images may be around 10% smaller than the maximum still image dimensions. (This size change is an effect of video stabilization, which works by cropping and rotating to find the stable region in a moving image). Examine the [AVCaptureResolvedPhotoSettings](../avcaptureresolvedphotosettings.md) object provided to your photo capture delegate to find the actual dimensions of each captured photo.
