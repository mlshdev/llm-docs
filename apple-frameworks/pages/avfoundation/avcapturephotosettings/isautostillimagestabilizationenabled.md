# isAutoStillImageStabilizationEnabled (Swift)

**Framework:** AVFoundation  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 10.0+ (deprecated in 13.0) · iPadOS 10.0+ (deprecated in 13.0) · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ (deprecated in 13.1)

A Boolean value that specifies whether captures use automatic image stabilization.

## Declaration

```swift
var isAutoStillImageStabilizationEnabled: Bool { get set }
```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

The default setting is [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true), unless you are capturing a RAW photo (By definition, RAW photos are unprocessed, and image stabilization involves processing the captured image).

When you enable this setting, the device automatically applies stabilization in low-light conditions to counteract hand shake. Automatic stabilization always includes digital image stabilization, and may also include optical lens stabilization, based on the current device.

Automatic image stabilization is not compatible with the [AVCaptureDevice.FlashMode.on](../avcapturedevice/flashmode-swift.enum/on.md) setting. If you explicitly enable the flash, the photo output ignores your image stabilization setting, and the [isStillImageStabilizationEnabled](../avcaptureresolvedphotosettings/isstillimagestabilizationenabled.md) property of the [AVCaptureResolvedPhotoSettings](../avcaptureresolvedphotosettings.md) object provided to your photo capture delegate is always [false](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false).
