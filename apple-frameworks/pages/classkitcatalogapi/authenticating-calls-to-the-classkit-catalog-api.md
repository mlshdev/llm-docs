# Authenticating Calls to the ClassKit Catalog API

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** ClassKit Catalog API  
**Kind:** Article

Establish your identity to the ClassKit Catalog server by providing a cryptographically signed token for each call.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

You authenticate the calls you make to the ClassKit Catalog API by including a cryptographically signed [JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519). You sign the JWT using a private key that you provision in [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com) website, and then include the signed token as part of the header of each call that you make.

### Register a Private Key

Sign in to the Apple Developer web site, and navigate to the “Certificates, IDs, & Profiles” page. Choose Keys in the sidebar, and then click the plus (+) button to add a new key. Name the key, and enable it for use with ClassKit Catalog. Complete the registration and download the private key.

You can download the private key only once. Apple doesn’t keep a copy of your key, so you can’t retrieve the key again. If you lose your key, you’ll need to revoke the key and create a new one. Similarly, if your private key is ever compromised, you’ll need to revoke the original key and create a new one.

### Create and Sign a Token

Compose a JWT as a combination of a header, a claim set, and a signature, as described in the [JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519) specification. Create the header as a JSON object with key-value pairs representing:

- The key identifier, given by the `kid` key. Provide the key identifier reported to you by the Apple Developer site after provisioning the key.
- The type of token, given by the `typ` key. Provide a value of `JWT` to indicated a JSON web token.
- The algorithm used to sign the token, given by the `alg` key. Set the value to `ES256` to indicate the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) algorithm with the P-256 curve and SHA-256 hash algorithm.

An example header looks like this:

```json
{
  "kid": "9QVIE72P19",
  "typ": "JWT",
  "alg": "ES256"
}
```

Create a claim set as another JSON object with key-value pairs representing:

- The issuer claim that identifies you as the issuer of the JWT, given by the `iss` key. Provide your Apple Developer account team identifier as the value.
- The issued-at claim that indicates when you created the JWT, given by the `iat` key. Indicate the number of seconds after the Unix epoch when you created the token.
- The expiration-time claim that indicates a time after which the JWT is no longer valid, given by the `exp` key. Indicate the number of seconds after the Unix epoch when the token should expire, which is typically 10 to 30 minutes after creation.

An example claim set looks like this:

```json
{
  "iss": "4J2MBDPZ6M",
  "iat": 1587058400,
  "exp": 1587060200
}
```

Base-64 encode and compute a signature over these two objects, as described in the JWT specification, using your private key with the P-256 ECDSA algorithm and a SHA-256 hash. The two encoded objects plus the computed signature, separated by periods, make up the JWT.

### Authenticate Requests with the Signed Token

Include the JWT with every request you make to the ClassKit Catalog API by adding `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>` to the header, where you replace \<`JWT>` with your actual token. Here is an example of making a request using the `curl` command line utility:

```shell
% curl -v -H "Authorization: Bearer <JWT>" "https://classkit-catalog.apple.com/v1/contexts?identifierPath=%5B%22com.apple.www.Quizzer%22%5D&environment=production&locale=en-us"
```
