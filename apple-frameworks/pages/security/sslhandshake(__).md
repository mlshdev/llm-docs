# SSLHandshake(\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Security  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** iOS 5.0+ (deprecated in 13.0) · iPadOS 5.0+ (deprecated in 13.0) · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ (deprecated in 13.1) · macOS 10.2+ (deprecated in 10.15)

Performs the SSL handshake.

> No longer supported. Use Network.framework.

## Declaration

```swift
func SSLHandshake(_ context: SSLContext) -> OSStatus
```

## Parameters

- `context`: An SSL session context reference.

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

A result code. See [Secure Transport Result Codes](secure-transport-result-codes.md).

## Mentioned In

- [Using the Secure Socket Layer for Network Communication](using-the-secure-socket-layer-for-network-communication.md)

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

On successful return, the session is ready for normal secure communication using the functions [SSLRead(\_:\_:\_:\_:)](sslread%28________%29.md) and [SSLWrite(\_:\_:\_:\_:)](sslwrite%28________%29.md).

If it finds any problems with the peer’s certificate chain, Secure Transport aborts the handshake. You can use the [SSLCopyPeerCertificates](sslcopypeercertificates.md) function to see the peer’s certificate chain. This function can return a wide variety of result codes, including the following:

- `errSSLUnknownRootCert`—The peer has a valid certificate chain, but the root of the chain is not a known anchor certificate.
- `errSSLNoRootCert`—The peer’s certificate chain was not verifiable to a root certificate.
- `errSSLCertExpired`—The peer’s certificate chain has one or more expired certificates.
- `errSSLXCertChainInvalid`—The peer has an invalid certificate chain; for example, signature verification within the chain failed, or no certificates were found.
- `errSSLClientCertRequested`—The server has requested a client certificate. This result is returned only if you called the [SSLSetSessionOption(\_:\_:\_:)](sslsetsessionoption%28______%29.md) function to set the `kSSLSessionOptionBreakOnCertRequested` option. After receiving this result, you must call the [SSLSetCertificate(\_:\_:)](sslsetcertificate%28____%29.md) function to return the client certificate, and then call [SSLHandshake(\_:)](sslhandshake%28__%29.md) again to resume the handshake. Use the [SSLCopyDistinguishedNames(\_:\_:)](sslcopydistinguishednames%28____%29.md) function to obtain a list of certificates acceptable to the server.
- `errSSLServerAuthCompleted`—The server authentication portion of the handshake is complete. This result is returned only if you called the [SSLSetSessionOption(\_:\_:\_:)](sslsetsessionoption%28______%29.md) function to set the `kSSLSessionOptionBreakOnServerAuth` option, and provides an opportunity to perform application-specific server verification before calling [SSLHandshake(\_:)](sslhandshake%28__%29.md) again to continue.

Note that in macOS prior to version 10.8, you must also explicitly call [SSLSetEnableCertVerify](sslsetenablecertverify.md) to disable verification.

A return value of `errSSLWouldBlock` indicates that the [SSLHandshake(\_:)](sslhandshake%28__%29.md) function must be called again until a different result code is returned.
