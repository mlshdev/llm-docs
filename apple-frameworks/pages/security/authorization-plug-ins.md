# Authorization Plug-ins (Swift)

**Framework:** Security  
**Kind:** API Collection

Extend the authorization services API by creating plug-ins that can participate in authorization decisions.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

Use plug-ins to extend macOS authorization services to perform authorizations in a new way or to implement a new policy that is too complex to be implemented entirely with the authorization policy database.

You must import this API explicitly:

**Swift**

```swift
import Security.AuthorizationPlugin
```

**Objective-C**

```objc
#import <Security/AuthorizationPlugin.h>       
```

> **Note**

>  When your plug-in needs to interact with the user, subclass the [SFAuthorizationPluginView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/securityinterface/sfauthorizationpluginview) class to maintain the look and feel of the system authentication dialogs.

## Topics

### First Steps

- [Extending authorization services with plug-ins](extending-authorization-services-with-plug-ins.md): Modify the system’s authorization policy with custom code.

### Creating a Plug-in

- [AuthorizationCallbacks Version](authorizationcallbacks-version.md): The version of the interface implemented by the authorization engine.
- [AuthorizationPluginInterface Version](authorizationplugininterface-version.md): The version of the interface implemented by the plug-in.

## Topics

### First Steps

- [Extending authorization services with plug-ins](extending-authorization-services-with-plug-ins.md): Modify the system’s authorization policy with custom code.

### Creating a Plug-in

- [AuthorizationPluginCreate](authorizationplugincreate.md): Initializes the plug-in and exchanges interfaces with the authorization engine.
- [AuthorizationPluginRef](authorizationpluginref.md): A handle passed by the plug-in to the authorization engine when the plug-in is initiated.
- [AuthorizationCallbacks](authorizationcallbacks.md): The interface implemented by the Security Server.
- [AuthorizationCallbacks Version](authorizationcallbacks-version.md): The version of the interface implemented by the authorization engine.
- [AuthorizationPluginInterface](authorizationplugininterface.md): The interface that must be implemented by your plug-in.
- [AuthorizationPluginInterface Version](authorizationplugininterface-version.md): The version of the interface implemented by the plug-in.

### Supporting Types and Constants

- [AuthorizationValue](authorizationvalue.md): A structure used to pass data between the authorization engine and the plug-in mechanism.
- [AuthorizationValueVector](authorizationvaluevector.md): A structure used to pass arguments from the authorization policy database to the authorization mechanism.
- [AuthorizationMechanismId](authorizationmechanismid.md): The mechanism ID specified in the authorization policy database is passed to the plug-in to create the appropriate mechanism.
- [AuthorizationPluginId](authorizationpluginid.md): An unused identifier for a plug-in.
- [AuthorizationMechanismRef](authorizationmechanismref.md): A handle passed by the plug-in to the authorization engine when creating an instance of a mechanism.
- [AuthorizationEngineRef](authorizationengineref.md): Handle passed from the authorization engine to an instance of a mechanism in a plug-in.
- [AuthorizationSessionId](authorizationsessionid.md): A unique value for an authorization session, provided by the authorization engine.
- [AuthorizationResult](authorizationresult.md): The permissible values for an authorization evaluation result.
- [AuthorizationContextFlags](authorizationcontextflags.md): The flags that specify whether authentication data should be made available to the authorization client.
