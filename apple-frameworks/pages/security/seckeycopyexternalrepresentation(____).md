# SecKeyCopyExternalRepresentation(\_:\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Security  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** iOS 10.0+ · iPadOS 10.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.12+ · tvOS 10.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 3.0+

Returns an external representation of the given key suitable for the key’s type.

## Declaration

```swift
func SecKeyCopyExternalRepresentation(_ key: SecKey, _ error: UnsafeMutablePointer<Unmanaged<CFError>?>?) -> CFData?
```

## Parameters

- `key`: The key to export.
- `error`: The address of a [CFError](../corefoundation/cferror.md) object. If an error occurs, this is set to point at an error instance that describes the failure.

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

A data object representing the key in a format suitable for the key type or `NULL` on error. In Objective-C, call the [CFRelease](../corefoundation/cfrelease.md) function to free the key’s memory when you are done with it.

## Mentioned In

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

The operation fails if the key is not exportable, for example if it is bound to a smart card or to the Secure Enclave. It also fails in macOS if the key has the attribute [kSecKeyExtractable](kseckeyextractable.md) set to [false](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false).

The method returns data in the PKCS #1 format for an RSA key. For an elliptic curve public key, the format follows the ANSI X9.63 standard using a byte string of `04 || X || Y.` For an elliptic curve private key, the output is formatted as the public key concatenated with the big endian encoding of the secret scalar, or `04 || X || Y || K`. All of these representations use constant size integers, including leading zeros as needed.

Returns an external representation of the given key suitable for the key’s type.

## Declaration

```objectivec

## Parameters

- `key`: The key to export.
- `error`: The address of a [CFErrorRef](../corefoundation/cferror.md) object. If an error occurs, this is set to point at an error instance that describes the failure.
