# GetHintValue

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** Security  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 2.0+ · iPadOS 2.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.4+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

Reads a value stored by the plug-in authorization mechanism.

## Declaration

```objectivec
int (*)(struct __OpaqueAuthorizationEngine *, const char *, const struct AuthorizationValue **) GetHintValue;
```

## Parameters

- `inEngine`: An opaque handle that is passed to your plug-in when the authorization engine calls your [MechanismCreate](../authorizationplugininterface/mechanismcreate.md) function.
- `inKey`: A key indicating which value you want to retrieve. This key must correspond to one you specified when you used the [SetHintValue](sethintvalue.md) function to store a hint value.
- `outValue`: On input, allocate a pointer to an [AuthorizationValue](../authorizationvalue.md) structure. On output, the structure contains the size of the data and a pointer to the data. Because your [AuthorizationValue](../authorizationvalue.md) structure does not own the data, you must not deallocate the structure or the data pointed to by the structure.

## Return Value

A result code. Possible results are [errAuthorizationSuccess](../errauthorizationsuccess.md) (no error) and [errAuthorizationInternal](../errauthorizationinternal.md) (Security Server internal error).

## Discussion

Your plug-in authorization mechanism can save and retrieve auxiliary information—called hints—for use by subsequent mechanisms that are part of the same authorization. You use the [SetHintValue](sethintvalue.md) function to have the Security Server store this data and the `GetHintValue` function to retrieve it. Hints are not preserved as part of the authorization result; once all mechanisms have approved the authorization or any mechanism has denied it, the security engine disposes of the hints.

The authorization engine sends you the entry point to the `GetHintValue` function in an [AuthorizationCallbacks](../authorizationcallbacks.md) structure when you call the [AuthorizationPluginCreate](../authorizationplugincreate.md) function.

> **Important**

>  Do not call this function after you have called the [SetResult](setresult.md) function. If you do so, the data retrieved by the `GetHintValue` function might not reflect the current value even though the function returns the [errAuthorizationSuccess](../errauthorizationsuccess.md) result code.
