## Overview

Signposts allow you to record meaningful information about the duration of your app’s tasks using the same subsystems and categories that you use for logging. Use `OSSignposter` to create signposted intervals in your code, and then use Instruments’ `os_signposts` instrument to record those intervals as you run your app and perform the actions to measure. Instruments displays signpost data visually in a timeline.

The icons represent the calls in code that begin and end the signposted interval.](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.os/media-3855979@2x.png)

To add a signposted interval, create a signpost ID — an identifier that disambiguates intervals that have the same name, subsystem, and category, and that exist within the same scope — and then add a call to one of the class’s `beginInterval` methods just before the code you want to measure. Retain the interval state it returns, and end the interval by passing that state to one of the class’s `endInterval` methods, which you call immediately after the measured code. A signposter uses interval state to enforce a number of runtime assertions, the behavior of which depends on your app’s build configuration. For more information, see [OSSignpostIntervalState](ossignpostintervalstate.md). A signposted interval consists of one begin call and one end call only.

`OSSignposter` also provides functionality to signpost a closure, and to emit individual signposts that don’t have a duration that you can use to highlight points of interest, such as when the user taps a button or performs a specific gesture.

## Topics

### Creating a Signposter

- [init()](ossignposter/init%28%29.md): Creates a signposter that uses the default subsystem.
- [init(subsystem:category:)](ossignposter/init%28subsystem_category_%29-94xpb.md): Creates a signposter that uses the specified subsystem and category.
- [init(subsystem:category:)](ossignposter/init%28subsystem_category_%29-4vdri.md): Creates a signposter that uses the specified subsystem and system-defined log category.
- [init(logger:)](ossignposter/init%28logger_%29.md): Creates a signposter that uses the subsystem and category of an existing logger.
- [init(logHandle:)](ossignposter/init%28loghandle_%29.md): Creates a signposter that uses the subsystem and category of an existing log.
- [disabled](ossignposter/disabled.md): A shared signposter that doesn’t emit signposts at runtime.

### Getting State

- [isEnabled](ossignposter/isenabled.md): A Boolean value that indicates whether the signposter can emit signposts.

### Generating Signpost IDs

- [makeSignpostID()](ossignposter/makesignpostid%28%29.md): Returns an identifier that’s unique within the scope of the signposter.
- [makeSignpostID(from:)](ossignposter/makesignpostid%28from_%29.md): Returns an identifier that the signposter derives from the specified object.
- [OSSignpostID](ossignpostid.md): An identifier that disambiguates signposted intervals.

### Starting a Signposted Interval

- [beginInterval(\_:id:)](ossignposter/begininterval%28__id_%29.md): Begins a signposted interval.
- [beginInterval(\_:id:\_:)](ossignposter/begininterval%28__id___%29.md): Begins a signposted interval and attaches the specified message.
- [beginAnimationInterval(\_:id:)](ossignposter/beginanimationinterval%28__id_%29.md): Begins a signposted interval for measuring an animation.
- [beginAnimationInterval(\_:id:\_:)](ossignposter/beginanimationinterval%28__id___%29.md): Begins a signposted interval for measuring an animation, and attaches a message.
- [OSSignpostIntervalState](ossignpostintervalstate.md): An object that tracks the state of a signposted interval.
- [SignpostMetadata](signpostmetadata.md): The type that represents a message you attach to a signpost.

### Stopping a Signposted Interval

- [endInterval(\_:\_:)](ossignposter/endinterval%28____%29.md): Ends the signposted interval that corresponds to the specified name and state.
- [endInterval(\_:\_:\_:)](ossignposter/endinterval%28______%29.md): Ends a signposted interval and attaches the specified message.

### Measuring a Closure

- [withIntervalSignpost(\_:id:around:)](ossignposter/withintervalsignpost%28__id_around_%29.md): Measures the execution of the specified closure.
- [withIntervalSignpost(\_:id:\_:around:)](ossignposter/withintervalsignpost%28__id___around_%29.md): Measures the execution of a closure and attaches the specified message.

### Emitting Individual Signposts

- [emitEvent(\_:id:)](ossignposter/emitevent%28__id_%29.md): Marks a point of interest in time.
- [emitEvent(\_:id:\_:)](ossignposter/emitevent%28__id___%29.md): Marks a point of interest in time and attaches the specified message.
