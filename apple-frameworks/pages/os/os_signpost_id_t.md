# os_signpost_id_t (Swift)

**Framework:** os  
**Kind:** Type Alias  
**Availability:** iOS · iPadOS · Mac Catalyst · macOS · tvOS · visionOS · watchOS

An identifier you use to distinguish between signposts that have the same name and destination log.

## Declaration

```swift
typealias os_signpost_id_t = UInt64
```

## Discussion

Multiple intervals with matching log objects and interval names can be in-flight simultaneously. In order for data-processing tools to correctly match the beginning and end of an interval, you need to identify each interval with a unique signpost identifier. Use the first strategy in the list below that matches your use case:

- If you can guarantee that intervals with the same log and name can never overlap in time, specify [OS_SIGNPOST_ID_EXCLUSIVE](os_signpost_id_exclusive.md) as the signpost ID.
- If you already have your own integer data that can uniquely identify each instance of the task being measured, cast the data from a [uint64_t](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/kernel/uint64_t) value directly to a `os_signpost_id_t`. The value must not match one of the predefined signpost values.
- If you have a pointer that can uniquely identify begin/end pairs (such as a pointer to a data object used by the code being measured), call [os_signpost_id_make_with_pointer](os_signpost_id_make_with_pointer.md). Don’t use this function for signposts that span process boundaries.
- Otherwise, call [os_signpost_id_generate](os_signpost_id_generate.md) each time you create a new pair of signposts to generate a unique value for that pair.

## Topics

### Creating a Signpost Identifier

- [os_signpost_id_generate](os_signpost_id_generate.md): Creates a signpost identifier that’s unique among signposts logged to a specified log.
- [os_signpost_id_make_with_pointer](os_signpost_id_make_with_pointer.md): Creates a signpost identifier that’s unique among signposts logging to the specified log, using a pointer value to generate the unique value.

### Using Built-in Signpost Identifiers

- [OS_SIGNPOST_ID_EXCLUSIVE](os_signpost_id_exclusive.md): A signpost identifier that indicates no overlap among different signpost time intervals.
- [OS_SIGNPOST_ID_INVALID](os_signpost_id_invalid.md): A signpost identifier that indicates an error.
- [OS_SIGNPOST_ID_NULL](os_signpost_id_null.md): The signpost identifier that represents a disabled signpost.

### Supporting Types

- [OS_SIGNPOST_TYPE_MASK](os_signpost_type_mask.md): A value the system uses to create built-in signpost identifiers; don’t use directly.
