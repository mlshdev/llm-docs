## Discussion

When you set this flag when creating an activity, the system creates the activity as a new top-level activity. If you provided a parent activity, the new activity notes this fact, allowing you to see which activity triggered the new activity without actually relating the activities.

Don’t pass [OS_ACTIVITY_FLAG_DETACHED](os_activity_flag_detached.md) and [OS_ACTIVITY_FLAG_IF_NONE_PRESENT](os_activity_flag_if_none_present.md) at the same time.
