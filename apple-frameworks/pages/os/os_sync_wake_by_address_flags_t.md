# os_sync_wake_by_address_flags_t

**Interface language:** Objective-C

Flags to control futex wake behavior.

## Declaration

```objectivec
typedef enum { ... } os_sync_wake_by_address_flags_t;
```

## Topics

### Enumeration Cases

- [OS_SYNC_WAKE_BY_ADDRESS_NONE](os_sync_wake_by_address_flags_t/os_sync_wake_by_address_none.md): The default behavior for futex functions that wake a thread.
- [OS_SYNC_WAKE_BY_ADDRESS_SHARED](os_sync_wake_by_address_flags_t/os_sync_wake_by_address_shared.md): A flag to indicate an address is in a shared memory region, allowing you to wake another waiting process.
