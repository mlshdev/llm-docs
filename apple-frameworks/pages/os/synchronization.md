# Synchronization (Swift)

**Framework:** os  
**Kind:** API Collection

Access low-level synchronization mechanisms to control state across threads.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

> **Note**

> When possible, use higher-level synchronization primitives such as `pthread`, Grand Central Dispatch, or Swift’s concurrency features to control access to state across different threads. For more information, see [Updating an app to use strict concurrency](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/updating-an-app-to-use-strict-concurrency).

## Topics

### Swift Wrappers

- [OSAllocatedUnfairLock](osallocatedunfairlock.md): A structure that creates an unfair lock.
- [OSAllocatedUnfairLockFlags](osallocatedunfairlockflags.md)

## Topics

### Unfair Locking

- [os_unfair_lock](os_unfair_lock.md): A structure that contains the data for an unfair lock.
- [OS_UNFAIR_LOCK_INIT](os_unfair_lock_init.md): A value you use to initialize a new unfair lock.
- [os_unfair_lock_t](os_unfair_lock_t.md): A pointer to an unfair lock structure.
- [os_unfair_lock_lock](os_unfair_lock_lock.md): A low-level lock that allows waiters to block efficiently on contention.
- [os_unfair_lock_trylock](os_unfair_lock_trylock.md): Locks an unfair lock if it is not already locked.
- [os_unfair_lock_lock_with_flags](os_unfair_lock_lock_with_flags.md)
- [os_unfair_lock_unlock](os_unfair_lock_unlock.md): Unlocks an unfair lock.
- [os_unfair_lock_assert_owner](os_unfair_lock_assert_owner.md): Triggers an assertion if the calling thread doesn’t own the specified unfair lock.
- [os_unfair_lock_assert_not_owner](os_unfair_lock_assert_not_owner.md): Triggers an assertion if the calling thread owns the specified unfair lock.
- [os_unfair_lock_flags_t](os_unfair_lock_flags_t.md)

### Futex Conditional Wait Primitives

- [os_sync_wait_on_address](os_sync_wait_on_address.md): An atomic compare-and-wait operation, used to implement higher-level synchronization primitives.
- [os_sync_wait_on_address_with_deadline](os_sync_wait_on_address_with_deadline.md): An atomic compare-and-wait operation with a deadline, used to implement higher-level synchronization primitives.
- [os_sync_wait_on_address_with_timeout](os_sync_wait_on_address_with_timeout.md): An atomic compare-and-wait operation with a timeout, used to implement higher-level synchronization primitives.
- [os_sync_wait_on_address_flags_t](os_sync_wait_on_address_flags_t.md): Flags to control futex wait behavior.
- [os_sync_wake_by_address_all](os_sync_wake_by_address_all.md): An atomic operation that wakes all threads blocked on a futex wait, used to implement higher-level synchronization primitives.
- [os_sync_wake_by_address_any](os_sync_wake_by_address_any.md): An atomic operation that wakes one thread blocked on a futex wait, used to implement higher-level synchronization primitives.
- [os_sync_wake_by_address_flags_t](os_sync_wake_by_address_flags_t.md): Flags to control futex wake behavior.
