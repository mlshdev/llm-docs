# Workgroups (Swift)

**Framework:** os  
**Kind:** API Collection

Schedule one or more threads to run at regular intervals and before specific deadlines.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

A workgroup manages one or more threads that work cooperatively toward a common goal. Use workgroups to coordinate the efforts of threads that handle real-time audio work. Registering threads with a workgroup helps the system direct work to the right system resources, and also helps it manage the competing needs of low-power consumption with maximum rendering output.

## Topics

### Essentials

- [Tuning your code’s performance for Apple silicon](../apple-silicon/tuning-your-code-s-performance-for-apple-silicon.md): Improve your code to get the best performance from both Apple silicon and Intel-based Mac computers.

### Interval Tasks

- [Porting your audio code to Apple silicon](../apple-silicon/porting-your-audio-code-to-apple-silicon.md): Eliminate issues in your audio-specific code when running on Apple silicon Mac computers.

## Overview

A workgroup manages one or more threads that work cooperatively toward a common goal. Use workgroups to coordinate the efforts of threads that handle real-time audio work. Registering threads with a workgroup helps the system direct work to the right system resources, and also helps it manage the competing needs of low-power consumption with maximum rendering output.

## Topics

### Essentials

- [Tuning your code’s performance for Apple silicon](../apple-silicon/tuning-your-code-s-performance-for-apple-silicon.md): Improve your code to get the best performance from both Apple silicon and Intel-based Mac computers.

### Interval Tasks

- [Porting your audio code to Apple silicon](../apple-silicon/porting-your-audio-code-to-apple-silicon.md): Eliminate issues in your audio-specific code when running on Apple silicon Mac computers.
- [os_workgroup_interval_start](os_workgroup_interval_start.md): Starts the regular execution of the workgroup’s threads at the specified time.
- [os_workgroup_interval_update](os_workgroup_interval_update.md): Schedules a new deadline for workgroup threads that run at regular intervals.
- [os_workgroup_interval_finish](os_workgroup_interval_finish.md): Stops the current interval-based execution of the workgroup’s threads.
- [os_workgroup_interval_t](os_workgroup_interval_t.md): A workgroup object that supports the scheduling of threads on a repeating cadence.
- [os_workgroup_interval_data_t](os_workgroup_interval_data_t.md): An opaque structure that contains additional configuration data for the interval workgroup.
- [os_clockid_t](os_clockid_t.md): Options for how to specify time-specific values in an interval workgroup.

### Parallel

- [os_workgroup_parallel_create](os_workgroup_parallel_create.md): Creates a new workgroup that manges threads working on a single task in parallel.
- [os_workgroup_parallel_t](os_workgroup_parallel_t.md): A workgroup object that supports the scheduling of threads that work in parallel to complete a task.

### Thread Attachment

- [os_workgroup_join](os_workgroup_join.md): Adds the current thread to the specified workgroup.
- [os_workgroup_leave](os_workgroup_leave.md): Removes the current thread from the workgroup it previously joined.
- [os_workgroup_join_token_t](os_workgroup_join_token_t.md): An opaque token that represents a connection between a thread and a workgroup.

### Cancellation

- [os_workgroup_cancel](os_workgroup_cancel.md): Cancels and invalidates the specified workgroup.
- [os_workgroup_testcancel](os_workgroup_testcancel.md): Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the workgroup is canceled.

### Workgroup Configuration

- [os_workgroup_max_parallel_threads](os_workgroup_max_parallel_threads.md): Returns the maximum number of threads that the system recommends you add to the specified workgroup.
- [os_workgroup_mpt_attr_t](os_workgroup_mpt_attr_t.md): An opaque structure containing attributes related to a request for the maximum number of parallel threads.
- [os_workgroup_set_working_arena](os_workgroup_set_working_arena.md): Distributes a block of managed memory to the threads of a workgroup.
- [os_workgroup_get_working_arena](os_workgroup_get_working_arena.md): Retrieves the workgroup’s shared data, and the thread-specific index into that data.
- [os_workgroup_index](os_workgroup_index.md): A unique index that the workgroup assigns to its joined threads.
- [os_workgroup_working_arena_destructor_t](os_workgroup_working_arena_destructor_t.md): A function that deallocates a workgroup’s currently assigned shared memory.

### Common Utilities

- [os_workgroup_create_with_workgroup](os_workgroup_create_with_workgroup.md): Create a new workgroup that is bound to the specified workgroup.
- [os_workgroup_create_with_port](os_workgroup_create_with_port.md): Creates a new workgroup that is bound to the workgroup with the specified Mach port.
- [os_workgroup_copy_port](os_workgroup_copy_port.md): Returns the Mach port associated with the workgroup.
- [os_workgroup_t](os_workgroup_t.md): An opaque object representing a default workgroup in the current process.
- [os_workgroup_attr_t](os_workgroup_attr_t.md): An opaque structure for storing workgroup-related attributes.
