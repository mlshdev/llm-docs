# os_sync_wait_on_address

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** os  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** iOS 17.4+ · iPadOS 17.4+ · Mac Catalyst 17.4+ · macOS 14.4+ · tvOS 17.4+ · visionOS 1.1+ · watchOS 10.4+

An atomic compare-and-wait operation, used to implement higher-level synchronization primitives.

## Declaration

```objectivec
extern int os_sync_wait_on_address(void *addr, uint64_t value, size_t size, os_sync_wait_on_address_flags_t flags);
```

## Parameters

- `addr`: The user-space address used for atomic compare-and-wait. This address must be aligned to `size`.
- `value`: The value expected at `addr`.
- `size`: The size of `value`, in bytes. Values can be 4 or 8 bytes, where 4-byte values use the lower bytes of `value`.
- `flags`: Flags for the operation.

## Return Value

If the thread is woken up by a corresponding futex wake, or the value at `addr` is different than expected, this function returns successfully and the return value indicates the number of outstanding waiters blocked on this address.

In the event of an error, the function returns `-1` with `errno` set.

## Discussion

This function reads a value from `addr`, compares it to the expected `value`, and blocks the thread if the two are equal. This sequence of operations is atomic with respect to other concurrent operations performed on `addr` with [Futex Conditional Wait Primitives](synchronization.md#Futex-Conditional-Wait-Primitives).

If this function blocks on the contents of `addr`, the thread waits to be woken up by a call to [os_sync_wake_by_address_any](os_sync_wake_by_address_any.md) or [os_sync_wake_by_address_all](os_sync_wake_by_address_all.md).

Pass consistent values across wait and wake APIs for `addr`, `size`, and `flags`. See [os_sync_wait_on_address_flags_t](os_sync_wait_on_address_flags_t.md) for details.

> **Important**

> Use this function only for implementing synchronization primitives that don’t have a sense of ownership, such as condition variables or semaphores. In particular, this function doesn’t provide priority inversion avoidance. For locking APIs, use existing OS primitives, such as `pthread` threads or [Unfair Locking](synchronization.md#Unfair-Locking) APIs. For synchronization and threading managed by the OS, use a higher-level API, such as [Dispatch](../dispatch.md).

### Error Handling

When this function returns `-1`, the global variable `errno` contains one of these values, indicating the corresponding error:

| Error code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `EINVAL` | Invalid flags or size.![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.os/spacer.png)The `addr` passed is `NULL` or misaligned.![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.os/spacer.png)The operation associated with existing kernel state at this `addr` is inconsistent with what the caller requested. |
| `EFAULT` | The `addr` is invalid.![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.os/spacer.png)The system experienced a transient error, such as low memory conditions. |
| `EDOM` | The `addr` is in use for non-compare-and-wait synchronization. |

In the case of an `EFAULT` that represents a transient error, you can attempt a retry. Before attempting another wait, check that the current value at `addr` still requires a wait.

The following code snippet illustrates a possible retry loop:

```c
retry:
   current = atomic_load_explicit(addr, memory_order_relaxed);
   if (current != expected) {
       int ret = os_sync_wait_on_address(addr, current, size, flags);
       if ((ret < 0) && ((errno == EINTR) || (errno == EFAULT))) {
           goto retry;
       }
}
```
