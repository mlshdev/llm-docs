# os_sync_wait_on_address_flags_t

**Interface language:** Objective-C

Flags to control futex wait behavior.

## Declaration

```objectivec
typedef enum { ... } os_sync_wait_on_address_flags_t;
```

## Topics

### Enumeration Cases

- [OS_SYNC_WAIT_ON_ADDRESS_NONE](os_sync_wait_on_address_flags_t/os_sync_wait_on_address_none.md): Default behavior for futex functions that block a thread.
- [OS_SYNC_WAIT_ON_ADDRESS_SHARED](os_sync_wait_on_address_flags_t/os_sync_wait_on_address_shared.md): Flag to indicate an address is in a shared memory region, allowing for a futex wake from another process.
