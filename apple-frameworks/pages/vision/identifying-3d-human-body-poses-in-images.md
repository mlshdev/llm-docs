# Identifying 3D human body poses in images (Swift)

**Framework:** Vision  
**Kind:** Article

Detect three-dimensional human body poses using the Vision framework.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Vision allows you to take your app’s body pose detection into the third dimension. All photos — with people in them — are a 2D representation of people in a 3D world. Starting in iOS 17 and macOS 14, Vision detects human body poses and measures 17 individual joint locations in 3D space. You access a joint location using the joint name itself, or with a joint group name that returns a collection of joints. The following illustration of a 3D model identifies the 17 joint locations that Vision detects.

![An illustration depicting a 3D model of the human body. The body points that Vision detects are the right and left wrists, elbows, shoulders, hips, knees, and ankles; the top and center of the head, the spine, the root that’s a point between the hips, and a center shoulder point between the shoulders.](https://developer.apple.com/images/Vision/media-4288127@2x.png)

Images you capture in Portrait mode using Camera — or using [AVFoundation](../avfoundation.md) — contain depth data that helps to detect distance for each pixel. If your content contains depth data, Vision fetches it automatically. With Vision, you can build an app that tracks a person performing an exercise in 3D space, follows the arm movement during a golf swing, or captures character animations for a video game.

### Perform a body pose request

Detecting the position of the joints on a human body in 3D space begins with [VNDetectHumanBodyPose3DRequest](vndetecthumanbodypose3drequest.md). The request only supports the detection and results for the most prominent person in the frame, so it generates a single observation. For example, performing a request on an image with three people — with one person being closer to the camera — returns an observation that detects the person closest to the camera.

The observation contains a collection of 17 [VNHumanBodyRecognizedPoint3D](vnhumanbodyrecognizedpoint3d.md) objects that contain the 3D position of a joint you specify, and the parent joint it connects to. The framework doesn’t return a partial list of joints, so you get all 17 joints or none.

The request doesn’t require images with depth data to run. However, providing depth data improves detection accuracy.

```swift
import Vision

// Get an image from the project bundle. 
guard let filePath = Bundle.main.path(forResource: "bodypose", ofType: "heic") else { 
    return 
} 
let fileUrl = URL(fileURLWithPath: filePath) 

// Create an object to process the request.  
let requestHandler = VNImageRequestHandler(url: fileUrl) 

// Create a request to detect a body pose in 3D space. 
let request = VNDetectHumanBodyPose3DRequest() 

do {    
    // Perform the body pose request.    
    try requestHandler.perform([request])    

    // Get the observation.    
    if let observation = request.results?.first {        
        // Handle the observation.    
    }
} catch {
    print("Unable to perform the request: \(error).") 
}
```

<a id="Handle-the-resulting-observation"></a>

### Handle the resulting observation

A [VNHumanBodyPose3DObservation](vnhumanbodypose3dobservation.md) provides body pose information in 3D space, in meters. The framework normalizes 2D points — from other framework requests — to a lower-left origin. Points that a 3D body pose request returns are relative to the scene in the real world, with an origin at the root joint, located between the [leftHip](vnhumanbodypose3dobservation/jointname/lefthip.md) and [rightHip](vnhumanbodypose3dobservation/jointname/righthip.md).

To get a list of the available joint names, call [supportedJointNames](vndetecthumanbodypose3drequest/supportedjointnames.md). Joints are also grouped by their location on the body. For example, the left arm group provides the left shoulder, elbow and wrist joints. To get a list of the group names, call [supportedJointsGroupNames](vndetecthumanbodypose3drequest/supportedjointsgroupnames.md).

```swift
// Get a recognized joint by using a joint name. 
let leftShoulder = try observation.recognizedPoint(.leftShoulder) 
let leftElbow = try observation.recognizedPoint(.leftElbow) 
let leftWrist = try observation.recognizedPoint(.leftWrist) 

// Get a collection of joints by using a joint group name. 
let leftArm = try observation.recognizedPoints(.leftArm)
```

If there’s enough depth metadata, [bodyHeight](vnhumanbodypose3dobservation/bodyheight.md) provides an estimated height of the subject, in meters; otherwise, [bodyHeight](vnhumanbodypose3dobservation/bodyheight.md) returns a reference height of `1.8` meters. The framework provides a measured height only when configuring an [AVCaptureSession](../avfoundation/avcapturesession.md) to use the LiDAR camera. For more information about configuring your session, see [Capturing depth using the LiDAR camera](../avfoundation/capturing-depth-using-the-lidar-camera.md).

![An illustration depicting a three-dimensional model of the human body and a camera. The camera points at the body pose and indicates where a person took the photo in relation to the body pose.](https://developer.apple.com/images/Vision/media-4292420@2x.png)

Use [cameraRelativePosition(\_:)](vnhumanbodypose3dobservation/camerarelativeposition%28__%29.md) to get an estimate of how far the person was away from a camera. To get an accurate understanding of where the camera was when capturing the image, use [cameraOriginMatrix](vnhumanbodypose3dobservation/cameraoriginmatrix.md).

<a id="Work-with-positions-in-3D-space"></a>

### Work with positions in 3D space

The Vision framework represents a 3D position as a [simd_float4x4](../simd/simd_float4x4.md) matrix. A [VNHumanBodyRecognizedPoint3D](vnhumanbodyrecognizedpoint3d.md) object contains the position of the joint, in meters, along with an identifier that corresponds to the joint name. It also contains the [localPosition](vnhumanbodyrecognizedpoint3d/localposition.md) of the joint, which describes the position relative to a [parentJoint](vnhumanbodyrecognizedpoint3d/parentjoint.md).

> **Important**

>  A joint’s position is always relative to the root joint.

Use [pointInImage(\_:)](vnhumanbodypose3dobservation/pointinimage%28__%29.md) to project a 3D joint coordinate back to a 2D input image for the body joint you specify. For instance, if you want to align the 3D body pose with the 2D input image, use [pointInImage(\_:)](vnhumanbodypose3dobservation/pointinimage%28__%29.md) to get the root joint position in the input image.

A [localPosition](vnhumanbodyrecognizedpoint3d/localposition.md) is useful if your app is only working with one area of the body, and simplifies determining the angle between a child and parent joint.

```swift
import simd 

var angleVector: simd_float3 = simd_float3() 

// Get the position relative to the parent shoulder joint. 
let childPosition = leftElbow.localPosition 
let translationChild = simd_make_float3(childPosition.columns.3[0], 
                                        childPosition.columns.3[1], 
                                        childPosition.columns.3[2]) 

// The rotation around the x-axis. 
let pitch = (Float.pi / 2) 

// The rotation around the y-axis. 
let yaw = acos(translationChild.z / simd_length(translationChild)) 

// The rotation around the z-axis. 
let roll = atan2((translationChild.y), (translationChild.x)) 

// The angle between the elbow and shoulder joint. 
angleVector = simd_float3(pitch, yaw, roll)
```

<a id="Use-depth-data-as-input"></a>

### Use depth data as input

Depth data contains the information the system needs to reconstruct a 3D scene, and includes camera calibration data. [AVDepthData](../avfoundation/avdepthdata.md) serves as the container class for interfacing with depth metadata. Starting in iOS 17 and macOS 14, provide depth data when you initialize a [VNImageRequestHandler](vnimagerequesthandler.md) with sample or pixel buffers.

Images you capture using Photo mode in Camera store depth as disparity maps — a 2D map reduced from 3D space — with calibration data. You can also configure your [AVCaptureSession](../avfoundation/avcapturesession.md) to use LiDAR to get depth data. For more information about working with depth, see [Capturing photos with depth](../avfoundation/capturing-photos-with-depth.md) and [Enhancing live video by leveraging TrueDepth camera data](../avfoundation/enhancing-live-video-by-leveraging-truedepth-camera-data.md).
