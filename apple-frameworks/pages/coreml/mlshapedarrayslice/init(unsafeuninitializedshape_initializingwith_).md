# init(unsafeUninitializedShape:initializingWith:)

**Framework:** Core ML  
**Kind:** Initializer  
**Availability:** iOS 15.0+ · iPadOS 15.0+ · Mac Catalyst 15.0+ · macOS 12.0+ · tvOS 15.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 8.0+

Creates a shaped array slice from a shape and a closure that initializes its memory.

## Declaration

```swift
init(unsafeUninitializedShape shape: [Int], initializingWith initializer: (inout UnsafeMutableBufferPointer<Scalar>, [Int]) throws -> Void) rethrows
```

## Parameters

- `shape`: An integer array. Each element represents the size of the shaped array’s corresponding dimension.
- `initializer`: A closure you provide that initializes the shaped array’s underlying memory. The initializer calls your closure with a pointer to the memory and an array of strides that correspond to the shaped array’s dimensions.
