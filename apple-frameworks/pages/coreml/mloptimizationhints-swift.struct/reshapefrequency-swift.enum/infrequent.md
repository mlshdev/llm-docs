# MLOptimizationHints.ReshapeFrequency.infrequent

**Framework:** Core ML  
**Kind:** Case  
**Availability:** iOS 17.4+ · iPadOS 17.4+ · Mac Catalyst 17.4+ · macOS 14.4+ · tvOS 17.4+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 10.4+

The input shape is expected to be stable and many/all predictions sent to this loaded model instance would use the same input shapes repeatedly. On the shape change, Core ML re-optimizes the internal engine for the new shape if possible. The re-optimization takes some time, but the subsequent predictions for the shape should run faster.

## Declaration

```swift
case infrequent
```
