Computes logical AND on elements across the specified axes of a tensor where the scalar type of the tensor is expected to be Boolean.

## Declaration

```swift
func all(alongAxes axes: Int..., keepRank: Bool = false) -> MLTensor
```

## Parameters

- `axes`: The axes to reduce.
- `keepRank`: A Boolean indicating whether to keep the reduced axes or not. The default value is `false`.
