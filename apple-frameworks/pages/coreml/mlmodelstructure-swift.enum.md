# MLModelStructure

**Framework:** Core ML  
**Kind:** Enumeration  
**Availability:** iOS 17.4+ · iPadOS 17.4+ · Mac Catalyst 17.4+ · macOS 14.4+ · tvOS 17.4+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 10.4+

An enum representing the structure of a model.

## Declaration

```swift
enum MLModelStructure
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

```
// Load the model structure.
let modelStructure = await try MLModelStructure.load(contentsOf: modelURL)
switch modelStructure {
case .program(let program):
   // Examine ML Program model.
case .neuralNetwork(let neuralNetwork):
   // Examine Neural network model
case .pipeline(let pipeline)
   // Examine Pipeline model
default:
   // The model type is something else.
}
```
