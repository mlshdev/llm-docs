## Discussion

This method downloads any missing localized asset packs, waits for those downloads to finish, and removes any unneeded ones. If you’ve overridden the preferred languages by setting [resolvedLanguage](resolvedlanguage.md), then this method will respect that. It won’t remove any localized asset packs that you’ve downloaded manually.

> **Throws**

> When the set of locally available asset packs can’t be reconciled with the preferred languages. When the thrown error is an instance of [AssetPackManager.LocalAvailabilityError](localavailabilityerror.md), it provides information about asset packs for which the system successfully ensured local availability and those for which the system couldn’t ensure local availability, with an underlying error for each failure.
