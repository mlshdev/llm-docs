**Framework:** Background Assets  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 26.0+ · iPadOS 26.0+ · Mac Catalyst 26.0+ · macOS 26.0+ · tvOS 26.0+ · visionOS 26.0+

Returns the contents of an asset file at the specified relative path.

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated func contents(at path: FilePath, searchingInAssetPackWithID assetPackID: String? = nil, options: Data.ReadingOptions = .mappedIfSafe) throws -> Data
```

## Parameters

- `path`: The relative path.
- `assetPackID`: The ID of the asset pack in which to search for the file. By default, all downloaded asset packs are searched.

## Return Value

The file’s contents.

## Mentioned In

## Discussion

All asset packs share the same namespace, so you can treat the overall collection of downloaded asset packs as if it were a single root directory that contains all of your subdirectories and asset files, regardless of the specific asset pack in which any particular file resides. If there’s a file-path collision across multiple asset packs, then it’s undefined from which asset pack the file will be read unless you explicitly limit the search to a particular asset pack by passing a non-`nil` ID to the `assetPackID` parameter.

> **Throws**

> [ManagedBackgroundAssetsError.fileNotFound(at:)](../managedbackgroundassetserror/filenotfound%28at_%29.md) when no file is found at `path`.

> **Throws**

> When the path is not relative or when some other error occurs while finding or reading the requested file.
