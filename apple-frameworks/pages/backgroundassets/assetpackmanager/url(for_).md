# url(for:)

**Framework:** Background Assets  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 26.0+ · iPadOS 26.0+ · Mac Catalyst 26.0+ · macOS 26.0+ · tvOS 26.0+ · visionOS 26.0+

Returns a URL for the specified relative path.

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated func url(for path: FilePath) throws -> URL
```

## Parameters

- `path`: The relative path.

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

The URL to the item.

<a id="discussion"></a>

## Discussion

> **Warning**

> Don’t persist the returned URL beyond the lifetime of the current process.

> **Note**

> This method will return a well formed URL even if no item exists at the specified relative path in any asset pack, in which case any attempts to get its contents—whether it’s a file or a directory—will fail.

All asset packs share the same namespace, so you can treat the overall collection of downloaded asset packs as if it were a single root directory that contains all of your subdirectories and asset files, regardless of the specific asset pack in which any particular file resides. Unlike [contents(at:searchingInAssetPackWithID:options:)](contents%28at_searchinginassetpackwithid_options_%29.md) and [descriptor(for:searchingInAssetPackWithID:)](descriptor%28for_searchinginassetpackwithid_%29.md), this method supports retrieving entire directories—including packages—in which case it merges the corresponding slices of the shared logical directory from all downloaded asset packs that contain such slices. If there’s a path collision across multiple asset packs, then it’s undefined from which asset pack an individual file will be resolved.

> **Warning**

> This method is less efficient than are [contents(at:searchingInAssetPackWithID:options:)](contents%28at_searchinginassetpackwithid_options_%29.md) and [descriptor(for:searchingInAssetPackWithID:)](descriptor%28for_searchinginassetpackwithid_%29.md); use those methods instead if you can do so. In particular, this method shouldn’t be used to get the URL to the root of the shared asset-pack namespace. Don’t use this method to block the main thread.

> **Throws**

> When the path isn’t relative or when some other error occurs while finding the requested item.
