```

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

`body`’s return value.

<a id="discussion"></a>

## Discussion

To avoid races between your main app and your downloader extension, perform operations on the download manager—*e.g.*, fetching current downloads, scheduling new downloads, *etc.*—while maintaining exclusive control over it. Unlike [withExclusiveControl(\_:)](withexclusivecontrol%28__%29-2ang9.md), this method waits for exclusive control to be acquired and then relinquished before it returns.

> **Throws**

> When `body` throws or when exclusive control over the download manager can’t be acquired.
