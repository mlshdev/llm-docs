## Discussion

To avoid races between your main app and your downloader extension, perform operations on the download manager—*e.g.*, fetching current downloads, scheduling new downloads, *etc.*—while maintaining exclusive control over it. Use this method instead of [withExclusiveControl(\_:)](withexclusivecontrol%28__%29-1rf9w.md) to enforce that the attempt to acquire exclusive control fail if the system can’t fulfill it before a particular date. Unlike [withExclusiveControl(beforeDate:perform:)](withexclusivecontrol%28beforedate_perform_%29.md), this method waits for exclusive control to be acquired and then relinquished before it returns.

> **Throws**

> When `body` throws or when exclusive control over the download manager can’t be acquired before `date`.
