# Testing asset packs locally

**Interface languages:** Swift, Objective-C

**Framework:** Background Assets  
**Kind:** Article

Test your system-managed asset packs using a mock server on your Mac.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

Before you submit your asset packs to TestFlight or the App Store, you can use a mock server to test downloading asset packs and accessing files locally.

Background Assets uses HTTPS for all downloads, so you need an SSL certificate for the mock server to use. If you don’t have access to a publicly trusted certificate authority (CA), then you can create your own root CA, manually trust it on your test devices, and use it to issue an SSL certificate.

To create Apple-hosted asset packs that specify a download policy, see [Creating managed asset packs](creating-managed-asset-packs.md). To add an Apple-Hosted Background Assets downloader extension to your app, see [Downloading Apple-hosted asset packs](downloading-apple-hosted-asset-packs.md).

### Create a root CA

You create a root CA on your Mac using Keychain Access. To quickly open Keychain Access, search for Keychain Access in Spotlight and press Return. Then follow these steps to create a self-signed certificate:

1. In Keychain Access, choose Keychain Access \> Certificate Assistant \> Create a Certificate Authority
2. In the Create Your Certificate Authority sheet, enter a name for the root CA, choose Self Signed Root CA as the identity type, and select SSL Server for user certificate. Enable “Let me override defaults”, enter an email address, and click Continue.
3. In the Certificate Information sheet, deselect “Sign your invitation” and click Continue.
4. In the next Certificate Information sheet, optionally provide information about your organization, and then click Continue.
5. In these following sheets, leave the default options with all the text fields blank and click Continue:

   - Key Pair Information For This CA
   - Specify Key Pair Information For Users of This CA
   - Key Usage Extension For This CA
   - Key Usage Extension For Users of This CA
   - Extended Key Usage Extension For This CA
   - Extended Key Usage Extension For Users Of This CA
   - Basic Constraints Extension For This CA
   - Basic Constraints Extension For Users Of This CA
   - Subject Alternate Name Extension For This CA
   - Subject Alternate Name Extension For Users Of This CA
6. In the Specify a Location For The Certificate sheet, select “login” as the keychain, enable “On this machine, trust certificates signed by this CA,” and click Create.
7. If necessary, authenticate with Touch ID, your Apple Watch, or your password.
8. Review the information in the Conclusion sheet, and then close the Certificate Assistant window.

![A screenshot of Keychain Access that shows the Certificate Assistant window with the Conclusion sheet that you see after creating a root certificate authority.](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.backgroundassets/testing-asset-packs-create-root-ca@2x.png)

In Keychain Access, select the “login” keychain in the sidebar and click the Certificates tab (not the My Certificates tab). Control-click on your new CA and select Export *Certificate Name*. In the dialog that appears, choose Certificate (`.cer`) as the file format, select a location to save the exported certificate, and click Save.

For more information on creating certificate authorities, see [Keychain Access User Guide](https://support.apple.com/guide/keychain-access).

<a id="Install-the-CA-on-test-devices-using-a-profile"></a>

### Install the CA on test devices using a profile

First you create a profile containing the CA, and then you install and trust the profile on test devices.

To create the profile, download [Apple Configurator](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-configurator/id1037126344) from the App Store. Then, open Apple Configurator and choose File \> New Profile in the menu bar or press Command-N. In the window that appears, follow these steps:

1. In the General tab, enter a name and an ID for the profile.
2. In the Certificates tab, click Configure.
3. In the sheet that appears, select your exported CA and click Open.
4. In Apple Configurator, choose File \> Save.

To install the profile on test devices, see [Install a configuration profile on your iPhone, iPad, or Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102400). To install the profile on macOS devices, see [Use configuration profiles to standardize settings on Mac computers](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/configuration-profiles-standardize-settings-mh35561/mac).

To trust the CA on test devices, see [Trust manually installed certificate profiles in iOS, iPadOS, and visionOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102390).

To trust the CA on macOS, open Keychain Access, select the “login” keychain in the sidebar, click the Certificates tab, Control-click your root CA, and choose Get Info. In the window that appears, expand the Trust section and select Always Trust. If necessary, authenticate yourself.

<a id="Issue-an-SSL-certificate"></a>

### Issue an SSL certificate

In Keychain Access on your Mac, choose Keychain Access \> Certificate Assistant \> Create a Certificate. In the Certificate Assistant window that appears, follow these steps:

1. In the first sheet, enter this information and click Continue:

   - Set the name to the IP address, hostname, or domain name where you’re hosting the mock server.
   - Set the identity type to Leaf.
   - Set the certificate type to SSL Server.
   - Enable “Let me override defaults.”

   ![A screenshot of Keychain Access showing the Certificate Assistant window with the Create Your Certificate sheet where you enter a name, choose an identity type, and configure other options before you click Continue.](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.backgroundassets/testing-asset-packs-create-your-certificate@2x.png)

   > **Important**

   > Unlike with a root CA, your SSL certificate’s name must be a valid IP address, hostname, or domain name.
2. In the Certificate Information sheet, leave the default options and click Continue.
3. In the next Certificate Information sheet, set the name (common name) to the same IP address, hostname, or domain name that you provided earlier. Optionally, provide information about your organization, and then click Continue.

   ![A screenshot of Keychain Access that shows the Certificate Information sheet that appears when you create a certificate. The sheet shows optional personal information you can enter about the certificate, such as your email and organization name and address.](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.backgroundassets/testing-asset-packs-certificate-information@2x.png)
4. In the Choose An Issuer sheet, select your root CA as the issuer and click Continue.
5. In these next sheets, just click Continue:

   - Key Pair Information
   - Key Usage Extension
   - Extended Key Usage Extension
   - Basic Constraints Extension
6. In the Subject Alternate Name Extension sheet, either set dNSName to the hostname or domain name that you provided earlier or set iPAddress to the IP address that you provided earlier. Leave all other text fields blank and click Continue.

   ![A screenshot of Keychain Access that shows the Subject Alternate Name Extension sheet that appears when you create a certificate. The sheet shows the dNSName and iPAddress text fields, and the Continue button.](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.backgroundassets/testing-asset-packs-subject-alternate-name@2x.png)

   > **Important**

   > Provide exactly one IP address, hostname, or domain name in the appropriate text field and leave the other three text fields blank.
7. In the Specify a Location For The Certificate sheet, select the “login” keychain and click Create.
8. In the Conclusion sheet, click Done.

### Start the mock server with the SSL certificate

In Terminal, start the mock server with the `--host` flag set to the same IP address, hostname, or domain name that you used when issuing your SSL certificate, and pass the paths to the asset packs (files with a `.aar` filename extension) that you want to host:

```sh
xcrun ba-serve --host localhost Tutorial.aar HighQualityTextures.aar
```

In the Choose An Identity window that appears, select your SSL certificate (not your root CA) and click Choose. If necessary, authenticate with your password.

To create asset pack archives, see [Creating managed asset packs](creating-managed-asset-packs.md).

<a id="Configure-a-URL-override-in-Developer-settings"></a>

### Configure a URL override in Developer settings

Enable Developer Mode on all of your test devices (see [Enabling Developer Mode on a device](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/enabling-developer-mode-on-a-device)).

In iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, and visionOS, go to Settings \> Developer and click Development Overrides under Background Assets Testing. Under URL Override, enter your server’s base URL.

In macOS, install Xcode, and in Terminal, run the following command:

```sh
xcrun ba-serve url-override [Base URL]
```

Include the HTTPS scheme in the base URL and omit the path. Now, when you build and run your app through Xcode, your app downloads its asset packs from the mock server.
