# CMWaterSubmersionManager (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Motion  
**Kind:** Class  
**Availability:** iOS 16.0+ · iPadOS 16.0+ · Mac Catalyst 16.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 9.0+

An object for managing the collection of pressure and temperature data during submersion.

## Declaration

```swift
class CMWaterSubmersionManager
```

## Mentioned In

- [Accessing submersion data](accessing-submersion-data.md)

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Use this class to receive live depth, water pressure, and water temperature data on Apple Watch Ultra.

Start by assigning a usage description using the [NSMotionUsageDescription](../bundleresources/information-property-list/nsmotionusagedescription.md) key in your app target’s information property list. You also need to include an entitlement to access the live submersion data.

To access data for dives with a maximum depth of 6 m, add the Shallow Depth and Pressure capability to your app. For more information, see [Adding capabilities to your app](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding-capabilities-to-your-app).

To enable a maximum depth of 40 m, you must apply for the full Submerged Depth and Pressure entitlement. For more information, see [Express interest in the Submerged Depth and Pressure API](https://developer.apple.com/contact/request/submerged-depth-pressure-api/).

> **Note**

>  As the wearer approaches the maximum depth, the system sends a measurement with an [CMWaterSubmersionMeasurement.DepthState.approachingMaxDepth](cmwatersubmersionmeasurement/depthstate/approachingmaxdepth.md) submersion state. When they pass the maximum depth, it sends a [CMWaterSubmersionMeasurement.DepthState.pastMaxDepth](cmwatersubmersionmeasurement/depthstate/pastmaxdepth.md) state, and if they continue to descent past the maximum depth, it sends a [CMWaterSubmersionMeasurement.DepthState.sensorDepthError](cmwatersubmersionmeasurement/depthstate/sensordeptherror.md) state.

Next, check whether submersion data is available.

```swift
guard CMWaterSubmersionManager.waterSubmersionAvailable else {
    return false
}
```

If the [waterSubmersionAvailable](cmwatersubmersionmanager/watersubmersionavailable.md) property is [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true), instantiate a [CMWaterSubmersionManager](cmwatersubmersionmanager.md) object and assign a delegate.

```swift
// Instantiate the submersion manager.
submersionManager = CMWaterSubmersionManager()

// Assign the submersion manager delegate.
submersionManager.delegate = self
```

Your delegate then begins receiving updates from the system. For more information, see [Accessing submersion data](accessing-submersion-data.md).

## Topics

### Setting the delegate

- [delegate](cmwatersubmersionmanager/delegate.md): The object that receives updates about submersion data and events.

### Checking availability and authorization

- [waterSubmersionAvailable](cmwatersubmersionmanager/watersubmersionavailable.md): A Boolean value indicating whether the current device supports the submersion manager.
- [authorizationStatus](cmwatersubmersionmanager/authorizationstatus.md): A value indicating whether the app has user authorization to receive submersion data.

### Accessing the maximum depth

- [maximumDepth](cmwatersubmersionmanager/maximumdepth.md): The maximum depth supported by the water submersion manager.
