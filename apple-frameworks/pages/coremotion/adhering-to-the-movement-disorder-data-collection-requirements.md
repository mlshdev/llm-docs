# Adhering to the movement disorder data collection requirements

**Interface languages:** Swift, Objective-C

**Framework:** Core Motion  
**Kind:** Article

Ensure that your users understand and have control over the data your app collects.

## Overview

When using the movement disorder APIs, it’s critical that your app provides a transparent data collection experience. Your app must display an introductory screen that describes its data use policy. Additionally, some data types require specific disclosures.

> **Important**

>  Apps that offer movement disorders monitoring must adhere to the [Movement Disorder API Addendum](https://developer.apple.com/contact/request/movement-disorder-api-entitlement/). Note that only Apple Developer Program account holders can access the addendum. In addition, all health-related apps must follow best practices for handling the user’s health data, as defined by the HealthKit guidelines (see [Protecting user privacy](../healthkit/protecting-user-privacy.md)).

### Explain your app’s data use policy

Apps that perform movement disorder monitoring must display an introduction screen when the user first launches the app. This screen must describe the following:

- The app’s purpose and target audience.
- The data that your app collects during movement disorder monitoring.
- How you plan to use the data.
- Whether your app collects data while running in the background.
- Instructions on how to opt out of data collection in the future.

### Include required disclosures

For some types of data, your app must include additional text in the introduction screen. For each of the following situations, add the specified text:

- **Resting tremor data**: “This app is monitoring and collecting your Parkinsonian resting tremor data, only if you self-report or have been clinically diagnosed with resting tremor, and indicate within the app that this is true.”
- **Choreiform dyskinesia data**: “This app is monitoring and collecting your choreiform dyskinesia data, only if you self-report or have been clinically diagnosed with choreiform dyskinesias, and indicate within the app that this is true.”
- **Movement disorder data in the background**: “This app is able to collect your movement disorder data even when the app is not active, on screen, or responding to your user input.”
