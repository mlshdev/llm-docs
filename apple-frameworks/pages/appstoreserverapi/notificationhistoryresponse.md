# NotificationHistoryResponse

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** App Store Server API  
**Kind:** Object  
**Availability:** App Store Server API 1.5+

A response that contains the App Store Server Notifications history for your app.

## Declaration

```
object NotificationHistoryResponse
```

## Properties

- `notificationHistory` — `[notificationHistoryResponseItem]`: An array of App Store Server Notifications history records.

  If you set [onlyFailures](onlyfailures.md) to `true` in the [NotificationHistoryRequest](notificationhistoryrequest.md), this array contains only the notifications that failed to reach your server.
- `hasMore` — `hasMore`: A Boolean value that indicates whether the App Store has more notification history records to send. If `hasMore` is `true`, use the `paginationToken` in the subsequent request to get more records. If `hasMore` is false, there are no more records available.
- `paginationToken` — `paginationToken`: A pagination token that you provide to [Get Notification History](get-notification-history.md) on a subsequent request to get the next page of responses.

## Discussion

The [Get Notification History](get-notification-history.md) endpoint returns this response. Notification history records contain the notifications that the App Store server attempted to send to your server’s [App Store Server Notifications V2](../appstoreservernotifications/app-store-server-notifications-v2.md) endpoint.

The notification history response contains a maximum of 20 notification history records per response. If the history has more than 20 records, the [hasMore](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreserverapi/notificationhistoryresponse/hasmore) value is `true`. Call [Get Notification History](get-notification-history.md) again with `paginationToken` in the query to receive the next page of responses. When the App Store has no more records to send, the `hasMore` value is `false`.

> **Note**

>  The notifications in the history records reflect the state of an in-app purchase at the time the App Store originally sent the notification, and may not reflect its current state. To get the current state of auto-renewable subscriptions, call the [Get All Subscription Statuses](get-all-subscription-statuses.md) endpoint. For all other in-app purchase types, call the [Get Transaction History](get-transaction-history.md) endpoint.
