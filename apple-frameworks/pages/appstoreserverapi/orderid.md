## Discussion

When customers make one or more in-app purchases in your app, the App Store emails them a receipt. The receipt contains an order ID. Use this order ID to call [Look Up Order ID](look-up-order-id.md). Customers can also retrieve their order IDs from their purchase history on the App Store; for more information, see [See your purchase history for the App Store, iTunes store, and more](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204088).
