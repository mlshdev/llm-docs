Use Apple’s open source library to create JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to authorize your calls, verify transactions, extract transaction identifiers from receipts, and more.

## Overview

The App Store Server Library is an open source library from Apple, available in four languages. It makes adopting the [App Store Server API](../appstoreserverapi.md) and working with JSON Web Signature (JWS) transactions easier. Find the App Store Server Library for each language in the following GitHub repositories:

- Swift: [App Store Server Swift Library](https://github.com/apple/app-store-server-library-swift)
- Java: [App Store Server Java Library](https://github.com/apple/app-store-server-library-java)
- Python: [App Store Server Python Library](https://github.com/apple/app-store-server-library-python)
- Node: [App Store Server Node Library](https://github.com/apple/app-store-server-library-node)

Choose the language that best supports your server and expertise.

The App Store Server Library offers the following capabilities:

- An API client that encodes [App Store Server API](../appstoreserverapi.md) requests, decodes the responses, and creates the JSON Web Token (JWT) you use to authenticate the calls. For more information on using JWTs, see [Generating JSON Web Tokens for API requests](generating-json-web-tokens-for-api-requests.md).
- Functions that verify JWS transactions, to verify that Apple signed the transaction data you get in API responses, from [App Store Server Notifications V2](../appstoreservernotifications/app-store-server-notifications-v2.md) and from devices using [StoreKit](../storekit.md). See the functions `verifyAndDecodeTransaction`, `verifyAndDecodeAppTransaction`, and `verifyAndDecodeRenewalInfo`, available in each language the library supports.
- A utility that extracts transaction identifiers from receipts. The App Store Server API endpoints take a transaction identifier in the path parameter. Use this utility as you migrate from using [verifyReceipt](../appstorereceipts/verify-receipt.md) with [App Store Receipts](../appstorereceipts.md) to using the App Store Server API for transaction information.
- A function that generates JWS signatures, which you use in your app for promotional offer signatures, Advanced Commerce API in-app requests, and introductory offer eligibility. For more information, see [Generating JWS to sign App Store requests](../storekit/generating-jws-to-sign-app-store-requests.md).
