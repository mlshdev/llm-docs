## Properties

## Discussion

The order lookup response contains information about the [orderId](orderid.md) you specify when you call [Look Up Order ID](look-up-order-id.md).

If the `orderId` that you provide in the request is invalid, the response doesn’t include the `signedTransactions` array. If the `orderId` is valid, expect at least one transaction in the `signedTransactions` array.
