## Discussion

The App Store server returns this response when you call the [Extend Subscription Renewal Dates for All Active Subscribers](extend-subscription-renewal-dates-for-all-active-subscribers.md) endpoint. Because the endpoint runs asynchronously, this response means the App Store received your request and is processing it. The request may take multiple hours or days to complete, depending on the number of subscribers.

As the App Store server processes your request, it sends notifications ([App Store Server Notifications V2](../appstoreservernotifications/app-store-server-notifications-v2.md)) in near real-time to report on each subscription it processes. Look for notifications with the [notificationType](../appstoreservernotifications/notificationtype.md) of `RENEWAL_EXTENSION` and `RENEWAL_EXTENDED`. The server sends a `RENEWAL_EXTENSION` notification with a [subtype](../appstoreservernotifications/subtype.md) of `SUCCESS` when it completes the request.

The [Get Status of Subscription Renewal Date Extensions](get-status-of-subscription-renewal-date-extensions.md) endpoint reports on whether your request is complete. For completed requests, it also reports the count of successful and failed subscription-renewal-date extensions.
