## Discussion

The App Store server sends this response when you call the [Get Status of Subscription Renewal Date Extensions](get-status-of-subscription-renewal-date-extensions.md) endpoint. Your request to [Extend Subscription Renewal Dates for All Active Subscribers](extend-subscription-renewal-dates-for-all-active-subscribers.md) is complete when the value of the `complete` field is `TRUE`. Otherwise, the request is still in progress.

The App Store server also sends real-time notifications as it’s processing the subscription-renewal-date extension, including notifications with [notificationType](../appstoreservernotifications/notificationtype.md) values of `RENEWAL_EXTENSION` and `RENEWAL_EXTENDED`. For more information, see [App Store Server Notifications](../appstoreservernotifications.md). For more information about extending subscription renewal dates, see [Extending the renewal date for auto-renewable subscriptions](extending-the-renewal-date-for-auto-renewable-subscriptions.md).
