# transactionReason

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** App Store Server API  
**Kind:** Type  
**Availability:** App Store Server API 1.8+

The cause of a purchase transaction, which indicates whether it’s a customer’s purchase or a renewal for an auto-renewable subscription that the system initiates.

## Declaration

```
string transactionReason
```

## Possible Values

- `PURCHASE`: The customer initiated the purchase, which may be for any in-app purchase type: consumable, non-consumable, non-renewing subscription, or auto-renewable subscription.
- `RENEWAL`: The App Store server initiated the purchase transaction to renew an auto-renewable subscription.

## Discussion

If a customer upgrades an auto-renewable subscription, the upgrade is effective immediately and the `transactionReason` is `PURCHASE`.

If a customer downgrades an auto-renewable subscription, the product change occurs on the subscription renewal date. The resulting `transactionReason` is `RENEWAL`.
