Call this endpoint to identify and validate a customer’s in-app purchases, based on their order ID.

When a customer contacts you for support, ask for their order ID and use that value to call this endpoint. Customers can retrieve their order IDs from their purchase history on the App Store; for more information, see [See your purchase history for the App Store, iTunes store, and more](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204088). The App Store also sends customers an email receipt with an order ID each time they make in-app purchases.

A successful response with an [OrderLookupStatus](orderlookupstatus.md) value of `0` contains an array of one or more signed transactions for the in-app purchase based on the order ID. Use the decoded transaction, [JWSTransactionDecodedPayload](jwstransactiondecodedpayload.md), to identify information such as the `productId` and `purchaseDate` that you can use to provide customer support.

A response with an [OrderLookupStatus](orderlookupstatus.md) value of `1` doesn’t contain a signed transactions array.

The App Store Server API returns information based on the customer’s in-app purchase history regardless of whether the customer installed, removed, or reinstalled the app on their devices.
