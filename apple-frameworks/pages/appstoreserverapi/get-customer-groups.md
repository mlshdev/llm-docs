## Discussion

> **Important**

>  This endpoint is only available in the sandbox environment.

Call this endpoint to determine whether a customer has access to your app or its in-app purchases through an organization or group, and what role they hold in it. A *group* consists of customers whose access is purchased and managed centrally by a single account, rather than individually. Groups come from multiseat purchases: an organization buys seats through Volume Purchasing, or a subscriber buys seats through Group Purchases and invites others to join.

Use this endpoint only if your app offers a group experience where a customer’s group or role changes what you present — for example, exposing extra controls to a customer with the `ADMIN` [role](role.md), or grouping members into that administrator’s shared workspace. Group membership is separate from entitlement. To unlock content for a customer, read their transactions; don’t depend on group membership.

Provide any transaction identifier that belongs to the customer for your app. The response, [GetCustomerGroupsResponse](getcustomergroupsresponse.md), contains a [GroupEntry](groupentry.md) for each group the customer currently belongs to. Each entry identifies the group with a [groupId](groupid.md) and indicates the kind of group with a [groupType](grouptype.md). For a group with a [groupType](grouptype.md) of `ORGANIZATION`, the entry also lists the customer’s role for each of your products in a [RoleEntry](roleentry.md) array. If the customer doesn’t belong to any group, the response contains an empty `groups` array.

A customer can belong to more than one group, and can hold a different role in each.

To list the members of a group, call the [Get Group Members](get-group-members.md) endpoint.

### Test in the sandbox environment

In the sandbox environment, if the customer doesn’t belong to any groups with a [groupType](grouptype.md) of `CONSUMER`, this endpoint returns a placeholder group with a `groupType` of `ORGANIZATION`:

```json
{
  "groups": [
    {
      "groupId": "900000000000000000",
      "groupType": "ORGANIZATION",
      "roles": [
        {
          "productId": "example.productId.one",
          "role": "ADMIN"
        },
        {
          "productId": "example.productId.two",
          "role": "NONE"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Send the placeholder [groupId](groupid.md) of `900000000000000000` to the [Get Group Members](get-group-members.md) endpoint to get its corresponding placeholder response.
