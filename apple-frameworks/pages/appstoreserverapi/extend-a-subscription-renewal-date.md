## Discussion

Use this endpoint to compensate your customers for temporary service outages, canceled events, or interruptions to live streamed events by extending the renewal date of their paid, active subscription. This endpoint acts on a single subscription for a transaction identifier that you specify.

To call this endpoint, provide the original transaction identifier of the subscription that experienced the service interruption. In the request body, [ExtendRenewalDateRequest](extendrenewaldaterequest.md), provide the extension duration, the reason code for the extension, and a unique [requestIdentifier](requestidentifier.md) for each extension request.

When this endpoint extends eligible purchased subscriptions that support Family Sharing, it automatically extends the family members’ subscriptions as well. However, the endpoint doesn’t support requests to extend a family member’s subscription directly.

A successful response with an `HTTP` `200` status code contains the [ExtendRenewalDateResponse](extendrenewaldateresponse.md) object. The response object includes the same unique request identifier you provide in the request, and information you need to determine whether the extension succeeds. For successful extensions, the new subscription expiration date is the [effectiveDate](effectivedate.md). All status codes other than `HTTP` `200` indicate that the request failed.

> **Note**

>  After the subscription renewal extension goes into effect, there’s no way to reverse it. The extension period doesn’t count toward the one year of paid service when the App Store calculates the developer’s commission rate.

After a successful renewal date extension, Apple sends an email to notify the customer of their updated subscription renewal date.
