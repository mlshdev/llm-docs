## Discussion

Endpoints that paginate their results return a `paginationToken` when more results are available. Provide it on your next call to that endpoint to get the following page, and check [hasMore](hasmore.md) to determine whether to keep requesting pages.

Each endpoint sets its own page size:

- [Get Notification History](get-notification-history.md) returns up to 20 notification history entries per page.
- [Get Group Members](get-group-members.md) returns up to the number of members you request in the [limit](limit.md) query parameter, to a maximum of 100 per page.

Omit this parameter the first time you call an endpoint, and don’t change the rest of the request when you ask for subsequent pages.
