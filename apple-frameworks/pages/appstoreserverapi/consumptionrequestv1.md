## Overview

> **Important**

>  For App Store In-App Purchases that don’t use the Advanced Commerce API, use [ConsumptionRequest](consumptionrequest.md) with the [Send Consumption Information](send-consumption-information.md) endpoint instead.

## Discussion

Use `ConsumptionRequestV1` to provide information about the customer’s consumable in-app purchase or auto-renewable subscription when you call the [Send Consumption Information V1](send-consumption-information-v1.md) endpoint.

To create a valid request and avoid an `HTTP 400 Bad Request` error, [ConsumptionRequestV1](consumptionrequestv1.md) must contain all the required fields with proper data types and valid values. However, you can choose whether or not to provide information for most fields. Most fields have a valid option if you choose not to provide the information.

> **Note**

>  Use the field value for *undeclared*, where available, if you choose not to provide information.

For example, if you choose not to provide information for the [accountTenure](accounttenure.md) field, set [accountTenure](accounttenure.md) to `0`. If you choose not to provide information for the [appAccountToken](appaccounttoken.md) field, set its value to an empty string. Refer to each field’s documentation for the list of valid values, including the undeclared value where available.

The App Store server rejects requests that have a [customerConsented](customerconsented.md) value other than `true` by returning an `HTTP 400` error with an [InvalidCustomerConsentedError](invalidcustomerconsentederror.md).

### Provide the app account token in a consumption request

The [ConsumptionRequestV1](consumptionrequestv1.md) request body requires that you set the `appAccountToken` to a valid value of either a UUID or an empty string. Set the `appAccountToken` value to the value you received in the `CONSUMPTION_REQUEST` notification, or, if you choose not to provide this information, set the value to an empty string.

If you receive a `CONSUMPTION_REQUEST` notification for a transaction, find its associated `appAccountToken` value as follows:

- If you receive [App Store Server Notifications V2](../appstoreservernotifications/app-store-server-notifications-v2.md), the `appAccountToken` value is in [JWSTransactionDecodedPayload](../appstoreservernotifications/jwstransactiondecodedpayload.md).
- If you receive [App Store Server Notifications Version 1](../appstoreservernotifications/app-store-server-notifications-version-1.md), the `appAccountToken` value is in [unified_receipt.Latest_receipt_info](../appstoreservernotifications/unified_receipt/latest_receipt_info-data.dictionary.md).

The `appAccountToken` value may be an empty string if your app doesn’t use app account tokens.

For more information about App Store Server Notifications versions, see [App Store Server Notifications changelog](../appstoreservernotifications/app-store-server-notifications-changelog.md).
