## Discussion

Use this value to determine which app version the customer first purchased or downloaded. This value remains constant and doesn’t change when the customer upgrades the app.

The string value contains the original value of the [CFBundleShortVersionString](../bundleresources/information-property-list/cfbundleshortversionstring.md) for apps running in macOS, and the original value of the [CFBundleVersion](../bundleresources/information-property-list/cfbundleversion.md) for apps running on all other platforms.

In the sandbox testing environment, the `originalApplicationVersion` value is always 1.0.
