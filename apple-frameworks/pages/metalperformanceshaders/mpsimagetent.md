# MPSImageTent (Swift)

**Framework:** Metal Performance Shaders  
**Kind:** Class  
**Availability:** iOS 9.0+ · iPadOS 9.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.13+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

A filter that convolves an image with a tent filter.

## Declaration

```swift
class MPSImageTent
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

The kernel elements of the filter form a tent shape with increasing sides, for example:

Like a box filter, this arrangement allows for much faster algorithms, especially for larger blur radii but with a more pleasing appearance.

The tent blur is a separable filter and the Metal Performance Shaders framework will act accordingly to give the best performance for multi-dimensional blurs.

> **Note**

>  The box filter, while fast, may yield square-ish looking blur effects. However, multiple passes of the box filter tend to smooth out with each additional pass. For example, two 3-wide box blurs produces the same effective convolution as a 5-wide tent blur.
>
> In effect, addition passes tend to approximate a Gaussian line shape.
