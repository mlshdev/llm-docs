## Details

`NSAccentColorName`

## Discussion

This `Info.plist` value controls the global tint color (iOS and watchOS) or accent color (macOS) for the target.  When set in a widget extension, the widget configuration user interface uses this color as the tint color while editing a widget.

While you can set this directly in your `Info.plist`, the recommended approach is to use the `Global Accent Color Name` build setting (in the `Asset Catalog Compiler - Options` section) of the target.  Set the value of the build setting to the name of the Color Set in the asset catalog. Xcode automatically sets `NSAccentColorName` to the appropriate value in the `Info.plist` file when building your project.
