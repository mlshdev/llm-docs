`ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption`

## Discussion

Set the value for this key to `NO` in your app’s [Information Property List](../information-property-list.md) file to indicate that your app—including any third-party libraries you link against—either uses no encryption, or only uses encryption that’s exempt from export compliance requirements, as described in [Overview of export compliance](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-information/overview-of-export-compliance/). Set the value to `YES` to indicate that your app uses non-exempt encryption.

If you set the value to `YES`, you typically also provide a value for the [ITSEncryptionExportComplianceCode](itsencryptionexportcompliancecode.md) key. You set that key’s value using a code Apple provides after successfully reviewing your export compliance documentation.

If you don’t have the [ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption](itsappusesnonexemptencryption.md) key in your app’s `Info.plist` file, App Store Connect walks you through an export compliance questionnaire every time you upload a new version of your app. Including the key streamlines the app submission process.
