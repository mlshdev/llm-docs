# LSArchitecturePriority

**Interface languages:** Swift, Objective-C

**Framework:** Bundle Resources  
**Kind:** Property List Key  
**Availability:** macOS 10.1+

An array of the architectures that the app supports, arranged according to their preferred usage.

## Details

`LSArchitecturePriority`

## Possible Values

- `i386`: The 32-bit Intel architecture.
- `x86_64`: The 64-bit Intel architecture.
- `arm64`: The 64-bit ARM architecture.
- `arm64e`: The 64-bit ARM architecture with pointer authentication code support.

## Discussion

Use this key to prioritize the execution of a specific architecture in a universal binary. This key contains an array of strings, with each string specifying the name of a supported architecture. The order of the strings in the array represents your preference for executing the app. For example, if you specify the `x86_64` architecture first for a universal app, the system runs that app under Rosetta translation on Apple silicon. For more information about Rosetta translation, see [About the Rosetta translation environment](../../apple-silicon/about-the-rosetta-translation-environment.md).
