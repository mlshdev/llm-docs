<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

The image file must reside at the top level of the app bundle. The name you specify for this key should not include a filename extension, nor should it include modifiers such as `@2x`, `-568h`, `~iphone`, or `~ipad`.

On disk, your image filenames may still include the modifiers as appropriate, although they are not required. The system automatically considers such modifiers when choosing which file to load.
