`NSWidgetBackgroundColorName`

## Discussion

This `Info.plist` value controls the background color shown in the widget configuration interface while editing a widget.

While you can set this directly in your Info.plist, the recommended approach is to use the `Widget Background Color Name` build setting (in the `Asset Catalog Compiler - Options` section) of the widget extension target.  Set the value of the build setting to the name of the Color Set in the asset catalog. Xcode automatically sets `NSWidgetBackgroundColorName` to the appropriate value in the `Info.plist` file when building your project.
