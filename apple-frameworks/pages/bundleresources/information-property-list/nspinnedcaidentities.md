## Discussion

Provide an array of dictionaries as the value for this key. Each dictionary in the array contains the [SPKI-SHA256-BASE64](nspinnedcaidentities/spki-sha256-base64.md) key with a value that represents the Base64-encoded SHA-256 digest of an X.509 certificate’s DER-encoded ASN.1 Subject Public Key Info (SPKI) structure.

```console
NSPinnedCAIdentities : Array {
    Dictionary {
        SPKI-SHA256-BASE64 : String
    }
}
```

When making a network connection to a named domain, App Transport Security (ATS) blocks the connection unless it can find the SPKI digest of at least one Certificate Authority (CA) or sub-CA certificate in the chain presented by the server.

You must include this key or the [NSPinnedLeafIdentities](nspinnedleafidentities.md) key or both in each domain-specific [NSPinnedDomains](nsapptransportsecurity/nspinneddomains.md) subdictionary. If you include both, then both must produce a match.
