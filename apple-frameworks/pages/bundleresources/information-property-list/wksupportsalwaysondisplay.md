## Discussion

If [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true), the system displays the app in the Always On state when the app is the frontmost app or running an active background session. Apps compiled for watchOS 8 and later have Always On enabled by default; however, users can disable Always On for the entire device or on a per-app basis by selecting Settings \> Display & Brightness \> Always On.
