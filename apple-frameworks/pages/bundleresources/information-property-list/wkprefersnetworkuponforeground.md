## Discussion

In low-power mode, the system turns off cellular data to preserve battery life. If this key is `NO`, the system waits until an app requests a network connection before turning on cellular data. This can cause a few seconds of delay before your app can perform network requests.

If your app needs access to the network immediately upon launch, set this key to `YES`.

[WKPrefersNetworkUponForeground](wkprefersnetworkuponforeground.md) defaults to `NO`.
