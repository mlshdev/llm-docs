`WKRunsIndependentlyOfCompanionApp`

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

Xcode automatically includes this key in the WatchKit extension’s information property list and sets its value to `YES` when you create a project using the iOS App with Watch App template. When you set the value of this key to `YES`, the app doesn’t need its iOS companion app to operate properly. Users can choose to install the iOS app, the watchOS app, or both.
