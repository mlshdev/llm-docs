## Discussion

When your app attempts to read sensor information for the first time on a user’s device, the system presents a sheet that describes the information your app collects. You specify which information by defining an `Info.plist` key in this dictionary for each sensor your app uses, such as [SRSensorUsageAmbientLightSensor](nssensorkitusagedetail/srsensorusageambientlightsensor.md). Users approve or deny your app’s ability to read private sensor information based on the description you provide for these properties.
