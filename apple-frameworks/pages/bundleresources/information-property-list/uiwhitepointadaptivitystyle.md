## Discussion

In split view, the system applies the style on the entire screen from the app with the weaker adaptivity style setting. For example, if one app uses the `UIWhitePointAdaptivityStylePhoto` style and another uses the `UIWhitePointAdaptivityStyleReading` style, the system uses the weaker `UIWhitePointAdaptivityStyleReading` style for the entire screen.
