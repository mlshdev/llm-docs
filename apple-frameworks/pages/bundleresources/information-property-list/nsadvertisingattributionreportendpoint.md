## Discussion

This key is a string that contains a valid URL containing your domain name. Provide a string in the format `“https://example.com”`, where you replace `example` with your domain name. Include this key in your app for the following two uses:

- To specify where the system sends event attribution data it receives from launched websites that support Private Click Measurement (PCM). PCM won’t work if your app doesn’t include this key.
- To specify where the system sends a copy of the winning install-validation postback to the advertised app’s developer, for apps that are advertised using the [SKAdNetwork](../../storekit/skadnetwork.md) API. Including this key is optional.

The system sends postbacks to a well-known URL it generates using the domain name you provide in the key. To receive the postbacks, configure your server to receive HTTPS POST messages at the following endpoints:

- To receive PCM event attribution data: `https://example.com/.well-known/private-click-measurement/report-attribution/`
- To receive SKAdNetwork install-validation postbacks: `https://example.com/.well-known/skadnetwork/report-attribution/`

Replace `example.com` with your domain name. The system uses only the registrable part of the domain name, and ignores any subdomains.

For more information about PCM and setting up a server to receive event attribution data, see [Introducing Private Click Measurement](https://webkit.org/blog/11529/introducing-private-click-measurement-pcm/). For more information about configuring an advertised app to enable its developer to receive postbacks, see [Configuring an advertised app](../../storekit/configuring-an-advertised-app.md) and [SKAdNetwork](../../storekit/skadnetwork.md).

> **Note**

>  Mac apps built with Mac Catalyst don’t support PCM.
