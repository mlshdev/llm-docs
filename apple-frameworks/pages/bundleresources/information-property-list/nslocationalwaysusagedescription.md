`NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription`

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

Use this key if your iOS app accesses location information in the background, and you deploy to a target earlier than iOS 11. In that case, add both this key and [NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription](nslocationalwaysandwheninuseusagedescription.md) to your app’s `Info.plist` file with the same message. Apps running on older versions of the OS use the message associated with [NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription](nslocationalwaysusagedescription.md), while apps running on later versions use the one associated with [NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription](nslocationalwaysandwheninuseusagedescription.md).

If your app only needs location information when in the foreground, use [NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription](nslocationwheninuseusagedescription.md) instead. For more information, see [Choosing the  Location Services Authorization to Request](../choosing-the-location-services-authorization-to-request.md).

If you need location information in a macOS app, use [NSLocationUsageDescription](nslocationusagedescription.md) instead.

> **Important**

>  This key is required if your iOS app uses APIs that access the user’s location at all times and deploys to targets earlier than iOS 11.
