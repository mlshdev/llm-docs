# LSRequiresNativeExecution

**Interface languages:** Swift, Objective-C

**Framework:** Bundle Resources  
**Kind:** Property List Key  
**Availability:** macOS 10.0+

A Boolean value that indicates whether to require the execution of the app’s native architecture when multiple architectures are available.

## Details

`LSRequiresNativeExecution`

## Discussion

The presence of this key causes the system to choose a native architecture over one that requires translation. For example, this key prevents the system from using the Rosetta translation process to execute the Intel portion of a universal app on Apple silicon.

If your app’s binary supports only the Intel architecture and you link the app against the macOS 11 SDK or later, the inclusion of this key prevents your app from running on Apple silicon. If you link the app against an earlier macOS SDK, the app runs under Rosetta translation.
