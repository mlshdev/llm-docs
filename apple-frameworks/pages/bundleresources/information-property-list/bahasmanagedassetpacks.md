## Discussion

Set this key to `YES` if you want the system to automatically download your asset packs and keep them up to date in the background.

Then, in your app’s code, manage asset-pack downloads using the `AssetPackManager` actor. In your extension code, use the StoreKit `StoreDownloaderExtension` protocol if you set the [BAUsesAppleHosting](bausesapplehosting.md) key to `YES`; otherwise, use the Background Assets `ManagedDownloaderExtension` protocol.
