## Discussion

The system associates the given symbol with your application. The system displays the symbol in the following locations:

- The action sheet displayed by an Action extension
- The Finder sidebar icons for file provider domains (macOS only)

To use a symbol from SF Symbols as the icon, set the value of `CFBundleSymbolName` to the symbol’s name. For example, to use the `flame.fill` symbol, configure the `Info.plist` entry as follows:

The value of CFBundleSymbolName is a string containing the value “flame.fill”.](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.bundleresources/media-3922506@2x.png)

The resulting item shown on the action sheet looks like this:
