## Details

`Entitlements`

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

An *entitlement* is a right or privilege that grants particular capabilities to an executable. For example, an app needs the [HomeKit Entitlement](entitlements/com.apple.developer.homekit.md) — along with explicit user consent — to access a user’s home automation network. An app stores its entitlements as key-value pairs embedded in the code signature of its binary executable.

You configure entitlements for your app by declaring capabilities for a target in Xcode; see [Capabilities](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/capabilities). Xcode records capabilities that you add in a property list file with the `.entitlements` extension. When code signing your app, Xcode combines the entitlements file, information from your developer account, and other project information to apply a final set of entitlements to your app.

You typically let Xcode manage the entitlements file for you. For information on manually editing the file, see [Editing property list files](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/editing-property-list-files).
