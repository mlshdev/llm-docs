# 5G Network Slicing Traffic Category (Swift)

**Framework:** Bundle Resources  
**Kind:** Property List Key  
**Availability:** iOS 17.0+ · iPadOS 17.0+

The key that defines the traffic category entitlement to enable Cellular Network Slicing.

## Details

`com.apple.developer.networking.slicing.trafficcategory`

## Possible Values

- `defaultslice-1`: A service type for Cellular Network Slicing when not setting the other service types.
- `video-2`: A service type for low-delay tolerant, very low-loss tolerant, inelastic flow, and constant packet rate connections.
- `background-3`: A service type for high-delay tolerant, high-loss tolerant, elastic flow, and variable size connections.
- `voice-4`: A service type for low-delay tolerant, very low-loss tolerant, inelastic flow, and constant packet rate connections.
- `callsignaling-5`: A service for low-loss tolerant, inelastic-flow, jitter tolerant, bursty but short rate, and variable size connections.
- `responsivedata-6`: A service type for medium-delay tolerant, elastic and inelastic flow, bursty, and long-lived connections.
- `avstreaming-7`: A service type for medium-delay tolerant, low-medium-loss tolerant, elastic flow, constant packet interval, variable rate, and size connections.
- `responsiveav-8`: A service type for low-delay tolerant, low-to-medium-loss tolerant, elastic flow, variable packet interval, rate, and size responsive (time-sensitive) connections.

## Discussion

To enable Cellular Network Slicing, you need to set the appropriate entitlements and properties.

Set this entitlement and the [5G Network Slicing App Category](com.apple.developer.networking.slicing.appcategory.md) entitlement in your property list. If you don’t entitle your app by specifying both these entitlements, your apps network connections won’t use Cellular Network Slicing, even if supported by the carrier.

Use this array to define the different slice types your app’s entitled to. For example, if your app opens network connections using the network service types video, voice, and call signaling, the entitlement property must include `video-2`, `voice-4,` and `callsignaling-5` values for this entitlement key.

Also set one of the following properties, depending on your app’s networking implementation:

- Set [serviceClass](../../network/nwparameters/serviceclass-swift.property.md) when using the Networking framework.
- Set [networkServiceType](../../foundation/urlsessionconfiguration/networkservicetype.md) when using [URLSessionConfiguration](../../foundation/urlsessionconfiguration.md).
- Set [networkServiceType](../../foundation/urlrequest/networkservicetype-swift.property.md) when using [URLRequest](../../foundation/urlrequest.md).

If your app uses sockets, set this entitlement to `defaultslice-1`. With sockets, all your app traffic uses a slice defined by the carrier to accept all traffic categories. You should still set the [5G Network Slicing App Category](com.apple.developer.networking.slicing.appcategory.md) entitlement.

> **Note**

>  Cellular Network Slicing is only available on supported carriers. Check with individual carriers for availability.
