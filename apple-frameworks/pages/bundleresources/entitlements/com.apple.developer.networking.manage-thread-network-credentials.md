## Discussion

Use this entitlement while developing and testing your app. Update your Xcode project by opening the Capabilities library to add Managed Thread Network Credentials (development) to your app.

Once you’re ready to publish your app, request distribution permission for this entitlement from the [ThreadNetwork Framework Entitlement Request](https://developer.apple.com/contact/request/threadnetwork) page. If approved, go to the Developer Portal and enable the assigned Manage Thread Network Credentials entitlement that includes the new distribution access.

For implementation issues and questions about API and tools, please submit a [support request](https://developer.apple.com/support/technical/).
