## Possible Values

- `development`: The App Attest sandbox environment that you use to test a device without affecting its risk metrics. Keys you create in the sandbox environment don’t work in the production environment.
- `production`: The App Attest production environment. Keys you create in the production environment don’t work in the sandbox environment.

## Discussion

To add this entitlement to your app, add the key to your app’s entitlements file manually, choose the `String` type, and set the associated value to either `development` or `production`. Alternatively, add the App Attest capability to your app target. This adds the entry to the app’s entitlements file with `development` as the associated value. If you omit the entitlement during development, your app uses the App Attest sandbox servers by default. You can test your app during development against the App Attest production servers by setting the entitlement to `production`.

After distributing your app through TestFlight, the App Store, or the Apple Developer Enterprise Program, your app ignores the entitlement you set and uses the production environment.

> **Important**

>  If you use the App Attest service in an App Clip, be sure to add the App Attest capability and the corresponding entry for both your app and your App Clip. Similarly, if you use the App Attest service in your app and an app extension, make sure to configure the capability and the App Attest sandbox environment for both your app and your extension.
