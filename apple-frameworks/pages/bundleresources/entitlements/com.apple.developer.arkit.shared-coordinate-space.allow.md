## Discussion

The Shared Coordinate Space access entitlement provides an app with access to the same shared space that the Nearby FaceTime API provides, without the requirement to use a FaceTime call.  This feature provides an app with the ability to share a coordinate space with other devices in the same physical space as each other to create shared spaces and objects between the devices.
