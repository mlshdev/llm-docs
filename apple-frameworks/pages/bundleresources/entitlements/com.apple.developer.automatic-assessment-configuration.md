## Discussion

Use an [AEAssessmentSession](../../automaticassessmentconfiguration/aeassessmentsession.md) instance to put a device into a state that prevents users from accessing certain system features during high-stakes assessment activities, such as administering an exam. Your app needs the [com.apple.developer.automatic-assessment-configuration](com.apple.developer.automatic-assessment-configuration.md) entitlement to create an assessment session.

To add the entitlement to your app, set the entitlement’s type to Boolean in the Xcode property list editor, and the corresponding value to `YES`.

Before your app can use this entitlement, you must first get permission to use it. Request permission by filling in the [Automatic Assessment Configuration Entitlement Request](https://developer.apple.com/contact/request/automatic-assessment-configuration/) form.

> **Important**

>  If your app has a deployment target earlier than macOS 11, to use the [com.apple.developer.automatic-assessment-configuration](com.apple.developer.automatic-assessment-configuration.md) entitlement, your app also needs the `com.apple.security.temporary-exception.mach-lookup.global-name` entitlement. Add this to your app’s entitlements file with a corresponding value that’s an array of strings containing the string `com.apple.assessmentagent`.
