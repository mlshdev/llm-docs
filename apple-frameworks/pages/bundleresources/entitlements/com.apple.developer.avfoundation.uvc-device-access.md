# UVC Device Access on visionOS (Swift)

**Framework:** Bundle Resources  
**Kind:** Property List Key  
**Availability:** visionOS 2.1+ (deprecated in 26.0)

A Boolean value that indicates whether the app can stream USB UVC devices connected to the Developer strap.

## Discussion

On visionOS, your app must have the this entitlement to discover and use devices of type [external](../../avfoundation/avcapturedevice/devicetype-swift.struct/external.md) using an [AVCaptureDevice.DiscoverySession](../../avfoundation/avcapturedevice/discoverysession.md).

This feature only supports USB2 devices drawing a maximum 500mA and supports the use of up to 1 hub.
