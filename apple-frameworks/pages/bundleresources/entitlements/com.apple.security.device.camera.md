## Discussion

To add this entitlement to your app, first enable the App Sandbox or Hardened Runtime capability in Xcode, and then select Camera.

In macOS 10.14 and later, the user must explicitly grant permission for each app to access cameras. See [Requesting Authorization for Media Capture on macOS](../requesting-authorization-for-media-capture-on-macos.md).
