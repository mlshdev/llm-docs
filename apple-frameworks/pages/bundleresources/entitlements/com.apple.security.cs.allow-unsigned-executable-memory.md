# Allow Unsigned Executable Memory Entitlement

**Interface languages:** Swift, Objective-C

**Framework:** Bundle Resources  
**Kind:** Property List Key  
**Availability:** macOS 10.7+

A Boolean value that indicates whether the app may create writable and executable memory without the restrictions imposed by using the `MAP_JIT` flag.

## Details

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

In rare cases, an app might need to override or patch C code, use the long-deprecated `NSCreateObjectFileImageFromMemory` (which is fundamentally insecure), or use the DVDPlayback framework. Add the [Allow Unsigned Executable Memory Entitlement](com.apple.security.cs.allow-unsigned-executable-memory.md) to enable these use cases. Otherwise, the app might crash or behave in unexpected ways.

> **Important**

>  Including this entitlement exposes your app to common vulnerabilities in memory-unsafe code languages. Carefully consider whether your app needs this exception.

To add the entitlement to your app, first enable the Hardened Runtime capability in Xcode, and then under Runtime Exceptions, select Allow Unsigned Executable Memory.
