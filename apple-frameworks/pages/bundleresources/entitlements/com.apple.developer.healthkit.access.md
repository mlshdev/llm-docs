## Discussion

The [HealthKit Entitlement](com.apple.developer.healthkit.md) provides access to most HealthKit data types. However, because of their highly sensitive nature, some data types require additional entitlements. The [HealthKit Capabilities Entitlement](com.apple.developer.healthkit.access.md) provides access to these data types.

To add this entitlement to your app, first enable the HealthKit capability in Xcode, and then check any values that you want to add to the [HealthKit Capabilities Entitlement](com.apple.developer.healthkit.access.md).

Only add values for data types that your app needs to access. App Review may reject apps that don’t use the data appropriately. For more information, see the [Health and Health Research](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#health-and-health-research) section of the [App Store Review Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/).
