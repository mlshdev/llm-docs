## Discussion

Visual fidelity monitoring is part of enterprise APIs for visionOS, a collection of APIs that unlock capabilities for enterprise customers.

To use the Visual Fidelity API, you need to apply for the entitlement. For more information, including how to apply for this entitlement, see [Building spatial experiences for business apps with enterprise APIs for visionOS](../../visionos/building-spatial-experiences-for-business-apps-with-enterprise-apis.md).
