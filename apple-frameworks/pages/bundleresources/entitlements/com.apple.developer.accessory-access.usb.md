## Discussion

This entitlement enables your app to gain exclusive access to USB devices using the Accessory Access framework.

> **Note**

> Without this entitlement, your code receives an AccessoryAccess error [internalError](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accessoryaccess/aaerror/internalerror) and a failure reason string of “Unable to communicate with service” when it attempts to call API in the Accessory Access framework.

Add the entitlement to your app by following these steps:

1. Open your app’s Xcode project and select your app from the target list.
2. Select the Signing & Capabilities panel.
3. Click “+ Capabilities” and enter “accessory” in the search field; then double-click the “Claim USB Accessory” entry to add the entitlement to your app’s entitlements file.
