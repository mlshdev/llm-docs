## Discussion

Add this entitlement to your app to inform the system that some of your app’s core features may perform better by exceeding the default app memory limit on supported devices. If you use this entitlement, make sure your app still behaves correctly if additional memory isn’t available.

> **Note**

>  An increased memory limit is only available on some device models. Call the [os_proc_available_memory](../../os/os_proc_available_memory.md) function to determine the amount of memory available. Higher memory use can affect system performance.
