## Overview

The system needs to know what kinds of data your app stores, provides, or consumes. Add keys to your app’s [Information Property List](information-property-list.md) that declare your app’s data management capabilities.

## Topics

### Documents

- [CFBundleDocumentTypes](information-property-list/cfbundledocumenttypes.md): The document types supported by the bundle.
- [UISupportsDocumentBrowser](information-property-list/uisupportsdocumentbrowser.md): A Boolean value indicating whether the app is a document-based app.
- [LSSupportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace](information-property-list/lssupportsopeningdocumentsinplace.md): A Boolean value indicating whether the app may open the original document from a file provider, rather than a copy of the document.
- [NSDownloadsUbiquitousContents](information-property-list/nsdownloadsubiquitouscontents.md): A Boolean value that indicates whether the system should download documents before handing them over to the app.

### URL schemes

- [CFBundleURLTypes](information-property-list/cfbundleurltypes.md): A list of URL schemes (http, ftp, and so on) supported by the app.

### Universal type identifiers

- [UTExportedTypeDeclarations](information-property-list/utexportedtypedeclarations.md): The uniform type identifiers owned and exported by the app.
- [UTImportedTypeDeclarations](information-property-list/utimportedtypedeclarations.md): The uniform type identifiers inherently supported, but not owned, by the app.

### Network

- [NSAdvertisingAttributionReportEndpoint](information-property-list/nsadvertisingattributionreportendpoint.md): The URL where Private Click Measurement and SKAdNetwork send attribution information.
- [NSAppTransportSecurity](information-property-list/nsapptransportsecurity.md): A description of changes made to the default security for HTTP connections.
- [NSBonjourServices](information-property-list/nsbonjourservices.md): Bonjour service types browsed by the app.
- [CKSharingSupported](information-property-list/cksharingsupported.md): A Boolean value that indicates your app supports CloudKit Sharing.

### Background downloads

- [BAUsesAppleHosting](information-property-list/bausesapplehosting.md): A Boolean value that indicates whether you use Apple’s service to host your asset packs.
- [BAHasManagedAssetPacks](information-property-list/bahasmanagedassetpacks.md): A Boolean value that indicates whether you let the system automatically manage your asset packs.
- [BAAppGroupID](information-property-list/baappgroupid.md): The app group identifier that you share between your app and the extension that uses asset packs.
- [BAInitialDownloadRestrictions](information-property-list/bainitialdownloadrestrictions.md): The restrictions that apply to the set of assets that download immediately after app installation.
- [BAMaxInstallSize](information-property-list/bamaxinstallsize.md): The combined, maximum size, in bytes, of the non-essential assets that download immediately after app installation.
- [BAManifestURL](information-property-list/bamanifesturl.md): The location URL of the app’s manifest file that contains the names and sizes of assets.
- [BAEssentialMaxInstallSize](information-property-list/baessentialmaxinstallsize.md): The combined, maximum size of the essential assets that the system downloads before it launches your app in bytes.

### Storage

- [APFiles](information-property-list/apfiles.md): Describes the files or directories the app installs on the system.
- [APInstallerURL](information-property-list/apinstallerurl.md): The base path to the files or folders that the app installs.
- [NSSupportsPurgeableLocalStorage](information-property-list/nssupportspurgeablelocalstorage.md): A Boolean value indicating whether the app continues working if the system purges the local storage.
- [LSFileQuarantineEnabled](information-property-list/lsfilequarantineenabled.md): A Boolean value indicating whether the files this app creates are quarantined by default.
- [UIFileSharingEnabled](information-property-list/uifilesharingenabled.md): A Boolean value indicating whether the app shares files.
- [CSResourcesFileMapped](information-property-list/csresourcesfilemapped.md): A Boolean value indicating whether the app’s resources files should be mapped into memory.
- [NSDownloadsUbiquitousContents](information-property-list/nsdownloadsubiquitouscontents.md): A Boolean value that indicates whether the system should download documents before handing them over to the app.

### CoreML models

- [LSBundleContainsCoreMLmlmodelc](information-property-list/lsbundlecontainscoremlmlmodelc.md): A Boolean value indicating whether the app contains a Core ML model to optimize loading the model.

### Java

- [NSJavaRoot](information-property-list/nsjavaroot.md): The root directory for the app’s Java class files.

### Services

- [Protected resources](protected-resources.md): Control an app’s access to protected system services and user data.
- [App services](app-services.md): Configure services provided by the app, like support for giving directions or using game controllers.
- [Kernel and drivers](kernel-and-drivers.md): Configure device drivers provided by the app.
