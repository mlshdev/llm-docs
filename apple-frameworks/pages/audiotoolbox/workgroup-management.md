# Workgroup Management (Swift)

**Framework:** Audio Toolbox  
**Kind:** API Collection

Coordinate the activity of custom real-time audio threads with those of the system and other processes.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Real-time audio rendering often requires coordination between the threads of an app, the system, and the threads of any active Audio Unit plug-ins. Workgroups provide the mechanism to coordinate the efforts of these different processes, and ensure that they execute on the same schedule. In an Audio Unit, use a render context observer to retrieve the workgroup that the host app uses for real-time audio rendering. In an app, fetch the workgroup for a Core Audio device directly from the device or from your [AUAudioUnit](auaudiounit.md) object.

If your app has real-time rendering threads that operate on their own deadlines, create your own workgroup using the [AudioWorkIntervalCreate](audioworkintervalcreate.md) function. Use your custom workgroup to set and update the rendering schedule for your threads.

## Topics

### Essentials

- [Understanding Audio Workgroups](understanding-audio-workgroups.md): Learn how to optimize real-time rendering performance with the Audio Workgroups API.
- [Adding Parallel Real-Time Threads to Audio Workgroups](adding-parallel-real-time-threads-to-audio-workgroups.md): Optimize the performance of real-time audio threads that run in sync with the I/O thread by adding them to the audio device workgroup.
- [Adding Asynchronous Real-Time Threads to Audio Workgroups](adding-asynchronous-real-time-threads-to-audio-workgroups.md): Optimize system performance by adding real-time audio threads that run asynchronously to the I/O thread to custom audio workgroups.
- [Adding Audio Unit Auxiliary Real-Time Threads to Audio Workgroups](adding-audio-unit-auxiliary-real-time-threads-to-audio-workgroups.md): If your Audio Unit plug-in creates auxiliary real-time rendering threads, add them to the host app’s audio workgroup so the system can schedule them appropriately.

### Device Workgroup

- [kAudioDevicePropertyIOThreadOSWorkgroup](../coreaudio/kaudiodevicepropertyiothreadosworkgroup.md): The device’s workgroup object, which you use to coordinate your threads with the threads of the device.
