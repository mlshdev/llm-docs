# MusicSequenceBeatsToBarBeatTime(\_:\_:\_:\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Audio Toolbox  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** iOS 5.0+ · iPadOS 5.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.5+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

Formats a music sequence’s beat time to its bar-beat time.

## Declaration

```swift
func MusicSequenceBeatsToBarBeatTime(_ inSequence: MusicSequence, _ inBeats: MusicTimeStamp, _ inSubbeatDivisor: UInt32, _ outBarBeatTime: UnsafeMutablePointer<CABarBeatTime>) -> OSStatus
```

## Parameters

- `inSequence`: The music sequence that you want bar-beat time for.
- `inBeats`: The beats to be represented as bar-beats.
- `inSubbeatDivisor`: The denominator of the fractional number of beats.
- `outBarBeatTime`: On output, the music sequence’s bar-beat time.

## Return Value

A result code.

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

The sequence’s tempo track time signature events are used to calculate the bar-beat representation. If there are no Time Sig events added to the sequence 4/4 is assumed. A time signature event is a MIDI Meta Event as specified for MIDI files.

Refer to `AudioToolbox/CAClock.h` for more information.
