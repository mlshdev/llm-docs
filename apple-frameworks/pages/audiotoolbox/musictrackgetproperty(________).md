# MusicTrackGetProperty(\_:\_:\_:\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Audio Toolbox  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** iOS 5.0+ · iPadOS 5.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.0+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

Gets a music track property value.

## Declaration

```swift
func MusicTrackGetProperty(_ inTrack: MusicTrack, _ inPropertyID: UInt32, _ outData: UnsafeMutableRawPointer, _ ioLength: UnsafeMutablePointer<UInt32>) -> OSStatus
```

## Parameters

- `inTrack`: The music track that you want to get a property value from.
- `inPropertyID`: The identifier for the music track property that you want to get. See [Music Track Properties](1515456-music-track-properties.md) for possible values.
- `outData`: On output, the requested property value.
- `ioLength`: On input, the available size for the retrieved property value. On output, the size of the valid property data that `outData` points to.

## Return Value

A result code.

## Discussion

Music track property values are always accessed by reference. As of OS X v10.6, all such property values are fixed length.

This function’s main purpose is to retrieve a music track property value, but you also use it to obtain the size of a variable-length property. Do this, prior to retrieving a variable-length property value, to ensure that you allocate enough memory in `outData` to hold the value.

To obtain a property value’s size, call this function with the `outData` parameter set to `NULL`. On output, the `ioLength` parameter contains the property size.
