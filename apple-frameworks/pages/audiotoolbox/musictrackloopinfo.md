## Overview

This data type is used for the value of the [kSequenceTrackProperty_LoopInfo](ksequencetrackproperty_loopinfo.md) property.

## Topics

### Initializers

- [init()](musictrackloopinfo/init%28%29.md)
- [init(loopDuration:numberOfLoops:)](musictrackloopinfo/init%28loopduration_numberofloops_%29.md): Initializes the music track loop information.

### Instance Properties

- [loopDuration](musictrackloopinfo/loopduration.md): The point in a music track, measured in beats from the end of the music track, at which to begin playback during looped playback.
- [numberOfLoops](musictrackloopinfo/numberofloops.md): The number of times to play the designated portion of the music track.
