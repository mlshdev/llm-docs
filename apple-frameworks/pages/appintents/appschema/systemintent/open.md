## Discussion

To make your app’s actions available to Apple Intelligence, conform your [AppIntent](../../appintent.md) to a schema that describes your action to the system. If your app’s functionality aligns with the `system` domain and one of your app’s actions matches the `open` schema, you can generate the properties and protocol conformance the schema requires for your intent implementation with the `@AppIntent( .system.open)` Swift macro. To make your app work with Siri, see [Apple Intelligence and Siri AI](../../apple-intelligence-and-siri-ai.md).

The following example shows an intent that conforms to the `open` schema:

```swift
@AppIntent(schema: .system.open)
struct OpenIntent: OpenIntent {
    var target: <#any AppEntity#>

    func perform() async throws -> some IntentResult {
        <#code#>
    }
}
```

The schema supports the following system experiences:

- Siri
- Shortcuts

For more information about the App Intents framework and the experiences it supports, see [Getting started with the App Intents framework](../../getting-started-with-the-app-intents-framework.md).
