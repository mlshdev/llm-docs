## Discussion

To make your app’s actions available to Apple Intelligence, conform your [AppIntent](../../appintent.md) to a schema that describes your action to the system. If your app’s functionality aligns with the `camera` domain and one of your app’s actions matches the `startCapture` schema, you can generate the properties and protocol conformance the schema requires for your intent implementation with the `@AppIntent( .camera.startCapture)` Swift macro. To make your app work with Siri, see [Apple Intelligence and Siri AI](../../apple-intelligence-and-siri-ai.md).

The following example shows an intent that conforms to the `startCapture` schema:

```swift
@AppIntent(schema: .camera.startCapture)
struct StartCameraCaptureIntent {
    var captureMode: <#CaptureMode#>
    var device: <#CaptureDevice#>?
    var timerDuration: <#CaptureDuration#>?

    func perform() async throws -> some IntentResult {
        <#code#>
    }
}
```

The schema supports the following system experiences:

- Siri
- Shortcuts
