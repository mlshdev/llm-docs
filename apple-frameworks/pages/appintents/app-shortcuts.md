# App Shortcuts

**Framework:** App Intents  
**Kind:** API Collection

Improve the experience of using your app intents and entities in system experiences like Siri, Spotlight, and the Shortcuts app.

## Overview

App Shortcuts provide a polished experience for your app intents and entities in the Shortcuts app and other system experiences. An App Shortcut combines the action from your app intent with other data, such as a title, image, and spoken phrases that someone might use to run the shortcut. A shortcut can also contain preconfigured parameters, so someone can run the action quickly, and without having to specify additional information. For example, a hiking app might offer an app intent to start a hike, but require you to select a trail before starting the action. Without a shortcut, someone must provide the trail information each time they run the intent. However, a shortcut can simplify this flow by offering to start a hike on the person’s favorite trail.

You create App Shortcuts programmatically in your code, and the compiler generates the information the rest of the system needs to use it. This approach means that the shortcuts you create are available as soon as someone installs your app, and you don’t have to register them yourself. Specify your shortcuts in your code by defining a custom type that adopts the [AppShortcutsProvider](appshortcutsprovider.md) protocol. Include this type in your app, app extension, Swift package, or library that you use to manage your intents-related code. Inside this type, construct one or more [AppShortcut](appshortcut.md) types using static data. Define your shortcuts in the same place you define the app intents that those shortcuts use.

> **Note**

> Apple may extract anonymized App Shortcuts data such as localized phrases, display representation values, and the title and description of related intents. Machine learning models use this data when training to help improve the App Shortcuts experience.

Although the Shortcuts app and other system features find your shortcuts automatically, you can also make them available from your app using tip views. The [SiriTipView](siritipview.md) and [SiriTipUIView](siritipuiview.md) types display the relevant shortcuts for the app intent you specify. You can also use a [ShortcutsLink](shortcutslink.md) or [ShortcutsUIButton](shortcutsuibutton.md) to open your app’s page in the Shortcuts app.
