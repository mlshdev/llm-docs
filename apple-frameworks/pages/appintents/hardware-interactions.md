## Overview

On supported iPhone models, people can run custom actions quickly using the Action button. This button is configurable in Settings, so people can assign any App Shortcuts you create to quickly access your app’s features. In select regions, people can also place custom actions on the side button of an iPhone to launch your conversational app.

On supported Apple Watch models, people can start a workout or dive session using the device’s Action button. This button is also configurable in Settings, and supports app intents that support the [StartWorkoutIntent](startworkoutintent.md) or [StartDiveIntent](startdiveintent.md) protocol.

For more information about how to create App Shortcuts, see [App Shortcuts](app-shortcuts.md). For design guidance related to the Action button, see [Human Interface Guidelines \> Action button](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/action-button).
