# Notes

**Framework:** App Intents  
**Kind:** API Collection

Make your note-taking app’s actions available to Apple Intelligence and Siri by adopting schemas for common note actions.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

The `.notes` domain defines app schemas that provide a structured representation for common note actions and content. Apply schemas in the `.notes` domain to make your app’s note-taking functionality available to Apple Intelligence and Siri.

- **[createNote](appschema/notesintent/createnote.md)**: An intent that creates notes when people say phrases like “Create a note called meeting notes.”
- **[updateNote](appschema/notesintent/updatenote.md)**: An intent that updates notes when people say phrases like “Rename this note to taxes.” or “Move this note to my work folder.”

> **Tip**

> Xcode generates a template implementation when you type `notes_` and select a schema from the suggestions list.
