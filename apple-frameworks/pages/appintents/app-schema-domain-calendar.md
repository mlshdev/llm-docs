# Calendar

**Framework:** App Intents  
**Kind:** API Collection

Make your calendar app’s actions available to Apple Intelligence and Siri by adopting schemas for common calendar actions.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

The `.calendar` domain defines app schemas that provide a structured representation for common calendar actions and content. Apply schemas in the `.calendar` domain to make your app’s calendar functionality available to Apple Intelligence and Siri.

The following table maps example phrases that apply to each schema:

| Calendar intent schemas | Example phrases |
| --- | --- |
| [createEvent](appschema/calendarintent/createevent.md) | “Create an event.” or “Schedule a meeting with Bill tomorrow at 2 PM.” |
| [deleteEvent](appschema/calendarintent/deleteevent.md) | “Delete this event.” or “Cancel the meeting.” |
| [updateEvent](appschema/calendarintent/updateevent.md) | “Reschedule the meeting.” or “Move the meeting to tomorrow.” |

> **Tip**

> Xcode generates a template implementation when you type `calendar_` and select a schema from the suggestions list.
