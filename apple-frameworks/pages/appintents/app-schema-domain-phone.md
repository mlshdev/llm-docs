# Phone

**Framework:** App Intents  
**Kind:** API Collection

Make your phone app’s actions available to Apple Intelligence and Siri by adopting schemas for calling actions.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

The `.phone` domain defines app schemas that provide a structured representation for common calling actions and content. Apply schemas in the `.phone` domain to make your app’s phone functionality available to Apple Intelligence and Siri.

- **[startCall](appschema/phoneintent/startcall.md)**: An intent that starts calls when people say phrases like “Make a call to Bill.” or “Video call Bill and Maria.”

> **Tip**

> Xcode generates a template implementation when you type `phone_` and select a schema from the suggestions list.
