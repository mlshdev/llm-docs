# EntityQueryProperty

**Framework:** App Intents  
**Kind:** Class  
**Availability:** iOS 16.0+ · iPadOS 16.0+ · Mac Catalyst 16.0+ · macOS 13.0+ · tvOS 16.0+ · visionOS · watchOS 9.0+

An object that provides the supported comparators you use to describe the different ways users can query against a property of an app entity.

## Declaration

```swift
final class EntityQueryProperty<Entity, Subject, Property, PropertyType, ComparatorMappingType> where Entity : AppEntity, Subject : AppEntity, Property : EntityProperty<PropertyType>, PropertyType : _IntentValue, PropertyType : Sendable
```

## Overview

Entity query properties are defined by by providing a `KeyPath` to an [AppEntity](appentity.md) property in your data model that this property applies to and then specify the set of supported [EntityQueryComparator](entityquerycomparator.md)s for this property.

`EntityQueryProperty` allows you to define more than one [EntityQueryComparator](entityquerycomparator.md) with functionality beyond strict equality. The set of comparators available depends on the underlying property type. For example, an [Equatable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/equatable) property type will allow for [EqualToComparator](equaltocomparator.md) and [NotEqualToComparator](notequaltocomparator.md) comparators while a [Comparable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/comparable) property type will add support for [GreaterThanComparator](greaterthancomparator.md), [GreaterThanOrEqualToComparator](greaterthanorequaltocomparator.md), [LessThanComparator](lessthancomparator.md), and [LessThanOrEqualToComparator](lessthanorequaltocomparator.md) comparators. See [Comparator](../foundation/comparator.md) for more details on available comparators.

An `EntityQueryProperty` doesn’t necessarily need to apply to a property of its parent Query `Entity`.

Consider the scenario where you have an application containing Photo and Album entities, and you want to support querying photos by the name of their containing album. Within a [EntityPropertyQuery](entitypropertyquery.md) in which `Entity` is Photo, you can define a `EntityQueryProperty` mapping to a name property of the Album entity, as long as you supply a closure for `entityProvider` that contains the logic to get from a Photo entity to an Album entity.

See [init(\_:entityProvider:comparators:)](entityqueryproperty/init%28__entityprovider_comparators_%29.md) for details.
