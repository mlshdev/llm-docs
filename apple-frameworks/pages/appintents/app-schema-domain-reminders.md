# Reminders

**Framework:** App Intents  
**Kind:** API Collection

Make your reminder app’s actions available to Apple Intelligence and Siri by adopting schemas for common reminder actions.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

The `.reminders` domain defines app schemas that provide a structured representation for common reminder actions and content. Apply schemas in the `.reminders` domain to make your app’s reminder functionality available to Apple Intelligence and Siri. Each schema defines the requirements for intents, parameters, and results so people get a consistent experience across reminder apps. For example, a person can create a reminder on different apps that support the [createReminder](appschema/remindersintent/createreminder.md) schema with the same phrases.

The following table maps example phrases that apply to each schema:

| Reminders intent schemas | Example phrases |
| --- | --- |
| [createList](appschema/remindersintent/createlist.md) | “Create a list called shopping.” |
| [createReminder](appschema/remindersintent/createreminder.md) | “Create a reminder.” or “Create a reminder called vote.” |
| [createSection](appschema/remindersintent/createsection.md) | “Create a section called vegetables.” |
| [deleteReminders](appschema/remindersintent/deletereminders.md) | “Delete this reminder.” |
| [updateReminder](appschema/remindersintent/updatereminder.md) | “Mark this reminder as completed.” or “Set the due date for this reminder to tomorrow.” |

> **Tip**

> Xcode generates a template implementation when you type `reminders_` and select a schema from the suggestions list.
