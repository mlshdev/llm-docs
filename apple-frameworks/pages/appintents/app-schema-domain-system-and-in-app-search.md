# System and in-app search

**Framework:** App Intents  
**Kind:** API Collection

Make your app’s actions available to Apple Intelligence and Siri by adopting schemas for in-app search and content access.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

The `.system` domain defines app schemas that provide a structured representation for common search actions and content. Apply schemas in the `.system` domain to make your app’s search and content access available to Apple Intelligence and Siri.

Unlike other domains that target a specific app category, the `.system` domain applies broadly. Any app that enables searching or opening content can adopt these schemas.

- **[search](appschema/systemintent/search.md)**: An intent that searches in your app when people say phrases like “Find bicycle.” or “Search for mountains.”
- **[open](appschema/systemintent/open.md)**: An intent that opens content in your app when people say phrases like “Open my screenshot.png file.”

> **Tip**

> Xcode generates a template implementation when you type `system_` and select a schema from the suggestions list.
