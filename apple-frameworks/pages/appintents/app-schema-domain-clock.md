# Clock

**Framework:** App Intents  
**Kind:** API Collection

Make your clock app’s actions available to Apple Intelligence and Siri by adopting schemas for common alarm and timer actions.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

The `.clock` domain defines app schemas that provide a structured representation for common alarm and timer actions and content. Apply schemas in the `.clock` domain to make your app’s clock functionality available to Apple Intelligence and Siri. Each schema defines the requirements for intents, parameters, and results so people get a consistent experience across clock apps. For example, a person can set an alarm on different apps that support the [createAlarm](appschema/clockintent/createalarm.md) schema with the same phrases.

The following table maps example phrases that apply to each schema. Your app needs to support all of these schemas when it supports any one of them.

| Clock intent schemas | Example phrases |
| --- | --- |
| [createAlarm](appschema/clockintent/createalarm.md) | “Set an alarm.” or “Wake me up at 7 AM.” |
| [updateAlarm](appschema/clockintent/updatealarm.md) | “Change my alarm.” or “Change the 7 AM alarm to 8 AM.” |
| [snoozeAlarm](appschema/clockintent/snoozealarm.md) | “Snooze.” or “Give me 5 more minutes.” |
| [dismissAlarm](appschema/clockintent/dismissalarm.md) | “Dismiss the alarm.” or “Stop the alarm.” |
| [deleteAlarm](appschema/clockintent/deletealarm.md) | “Delete my alarm.” or “Remove the 7 AM alarm.” |
| [createTimer](appschema/clockintent/createtimer.md) | “Set a timer.” or “Timer for 5 minutes.” |
| [updateTimer](appschema/clockintent/updatetimer.md) | “Add 5 minutes to the timer.” or “Change the timer to 10 minutes.” |
| [pauseTimer](appschema/clockintent/pausetimer.md) | “Pause the timer.” |
| [resumeTimer](appschema/clockintent/resumetimer.md) | “Resume the timer.” or “Start the timer again.” |
| [cancelTimer](appschema/clockintent/canceltimer.md) | “Cancel the timer.” or “Stop the timer.” |

At build time, Xcode validates whether your app implements all the schemas in the group.

> **Tip**

> Xcode generates a template implementation when you type `clock_` and select a schema from the suggestions list.
