# Camera

**Framework:** App Intents  
**Kind:** API Collection

Make your camera app’s actions available to Apple Intelligence and Siri by adopting schemas for common camera actions.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

The `.camera` domain defines app schemas that provide a structured representation for common camera actions and content. Apply schemas in the `.camera` domain to make your app’s camera functionality available to Apple Intelligence and Siri.

The following table maps example phrases that apply to each schema:

| Camera intent schemas | Example phrases |
| --- | --- |
| [openInCaptureMode](appschema/cameraintent/openincapturemode.md) | “Open the camera.” or “Take a photo.” |
| [switchDevice](appschema/cameraintent/switchdevice.md) | “Flip the camera.” or “Turn the camera.” |
| [startCapture](appschema/cameraintent/startcapture.md) | “Start recording.” or “Record a video.” |

> **Tip**

> Xcode generates a template implementation when you type `camera_` and select a schema from the suggestions list.
