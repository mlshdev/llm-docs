# Spotlight integration

**Framework:** App Intents  
**Kind:** API Collection

Add your entities to your app’s Spotlight index, and automate the indexing of your content.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

Indexing your app’s content makes that content findable during searches, and also helps Siri and other system features locate app-specific data. If you create entities for your app’s data, index those entities as part of your content. When a search finds your content, the system can use the associated entity to open your app and navigate to that content.

## Topics

### Essentials

- [Making app entities available in Spotlight](making-app-entities-available-in-spotlight.md): Update your app entity types to support Spotlight indexing, and donate entities to make them findable in searches.

### Spotlight support

- [IndexedEntity](indexedentity.md): An interface that allows you to include an entity in your app’s Spotlight index.
- [IndexedEntityQuery](indexedentityquery.md): An interface that adds Spotlight reindexing support to your entity query.
