### Getting the file information

- [filename](filename.md): The human-readable name of the file, which will be displayed to the user.
- [type](type.md): The uniform type identifier of the file. (i.e. “public.json”, “public.png”, or any custom type) More information about uniform type identifiers can be found in \<CoreServices/UTCoreTypes.h\>
- [data](data.md): The contents of the file. If the file was created with a URL, accessing this property will memory map the file contents.
- [removedOnCompletion](removedoncompletion.md): Indicates whether the file should be automatically deleted from disk when the Shortcut is done running. `false` by default.
