# App intent types

**Framework:** App Intents  
**Kind:** API Collection

Build your intents from types that define common behaviors such as opening or deleting items, playing or recording media, and more.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

The app intents you create conform to the [AppIntent](appintent.md) protocol for basic features, but you can choose other protocols as an alternate starting point. You might choose a different protocol for an intent that offers a specific behavior or supports a particular capability. For example, use the [OpenIntent](openintent.md) protocol if your app intent launches your app and displays a specific item. These protocols also conform to the [AppIntent](appintent.md) protocol, giving you both the base features and the additional behaviors you need for your specific app intent.

## Topics

### Common actions

- [OpenIntent](openintent.md): An app intent that opens and displays a specific item in your app’s interface.
- [OpenURLIntent](openurlintent.md): An app intent that opens one of your universal links and displays its contents.
- [SetValueIntent](setvalueintent.md): An intent that contains a value which can be set.
- [DeleteIntent](deleteintent.md): Delete the associated entity(s).
- [DeprecatedAppIntent](deprecatedappintent.md): An app intent that marks an action as deprecated and informs people which action to use instead.

### Search

- [ShowInAppSearchResultsIntent](showinappsearchresultsintent.md): An app intent that displays a set of search results in the app’s interface.
- [StringSearchCriteria](stringsearchcriteria.md): A type that tells your app to match its items against a provided string.
- [StringSearchScope](stringsearchscope.md): Constants that describe the types of content your app includes in search results when the search criteria is a string.

### Universal link navigation

- [URLRepresentableIntent](urlrepresentableintent.md): An interface you add to an app intent type so the system can handle it like a universal link.
- [IntentURLRepresentation](intenturlrepresentation.md): The type that provides the URL for an app intent.
- [CustomURLRepresentationParameterConvertible](customurlrepresentationparameterconvertible.md): An interface that allows a type to express its contents in a URL representation.

### Media actions

- [AudioPlaybackIntent](audioplaybackintent.md): An App Intent that plays, pauses, or otherwise modifies audio playback state when it executes.
- [AudioRecordingIntent](audiorecordingintent.md): An app intent that starts, stops or otherwise modifies audio recording state.
- [CameraCaptureIntent](cameracaptureintent.md): Designates intent that will launch an activity that uses device’s camera to capture photos or videos. Marking your intent with this protocol makes it available as a possible action for Camera quick action.
- [PlayVideoIntent](playvideointent.md): An intent that looks for videos based on a search term, then plays the content.
- [VideoCategory](videocategory.md)

### Communication actions

- [ProgressReportingIntent](progressreportingintent.md): An intent that reports progress to the system during its execution
- [PushToTalkTransmissionIntent](pushtotalktransmissionintent.md): An intent that begins or ends an audio transmission with the Push to Talk framework.
- [ShowInAppSearchResultsIntent](showinappsearchresultsintent.md): An app intent that displays a set of search results in the app’s interface.

### Controls, widgets, and Live Activities

- [ControlConfigurationIntent](controlconfigurationintent.md): An interface for configuring a Control Center module.
- [LiveActivityIntent](liveactivityintent.md): An intent that starts, pauses, or otherwise modifies a Live Activity when it runs.
- [WidgetConfigurationIntent](widgetconfigurationintent.md): An interface for configuring a WidgetKit widget.
- [RunSystemShortcutIntent](runsystemshortcutintent.md): An app intent you use in widgets to open another app or perform an App Shortcut, custom shortcut, or system action.

### SiriKit intent migration
