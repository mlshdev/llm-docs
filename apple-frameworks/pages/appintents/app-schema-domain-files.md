# Files

**Framework:** App Intents  
**Kind:** API Collection

Make your app’s file-management actions available in the Shortcuts app.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

The `.files` domain defines app schemas that provide a structured representation for common file-management actions your app can do. Expose your app’s file-management functionality to the system as actions in the Shortcuts app with the schemas in the `.files` domain. Schemas in this domain don’t make your conforming types discoverable by Apple Intelligence and Siri.

> **Tip**

> Xcode generates a template implementation when you type `files_` and select a schema from the suggestions list.

For more information about app schemas, see [App schema domains](app-schema-domains.md).
