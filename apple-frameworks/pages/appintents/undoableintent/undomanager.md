## Discussion

In your app intent’s [perform()](../appintent/perform%28%29.md) method, use this property to get an undo manager suitable for registering undoable actions. The system makes every effort to find a suitable undo manager given the current state of your app or app extension. However, if a suitable undo manager isn’t available, the value of this property is `nil`.

Use the undo manager in this property only to register your undoable actions. App intents don’t initiate calls to the [undo()](../../foundation/undomanager/undo%28%29.md) or [redo()](../../foundation/undomanager/redo%28%29.md) methods of the undo manager. Your app initiates undo and redo operations in response to interactions with its menus or interface.
