# continueInForeground(\_:alwaysConfirm:)

**Framework:** App Intents  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 26.0+ · iPadOS 26.0+ · Mac Catalyst 26.0+ · macOS 26.0+ · tvOS 26.0+ · visionOS 26.0+ · watchOS 26.0+

Attempts to transition the app to the foreground after optionally requesting permission to do so.

## Declaration

```swift
func continueInForeground(_ dialog: IntentDialog? = nil, alwaysConfirm: Bool = true) async throws
```

## Parameters

- `dialog`: The localized text you want the system to display or speak to confirm the transition.
- `alwaysConfirm`: `true` to ask the person to confirm the transition. If you specify `false`, the system might not ask for confirmation if it already received a recent confirmation. It doesn’t ask for confirmation if you recently called a `requestChoice` or `requestConfirmation` method of your intent, or asked to disambiguate a value. It does ask for confirmation if your app intent conforms to the [ProgressReportingIntent](../progressreportingintent.md) protocol but didn’t update the progress value recently.

## Discussion

Call this method from your app intent’s [perform()](perform%28%29.md) method when you want to continue running your code in the foreground. Before calling this method, use the contextual information in the intent’s [systemContext](systemcontext.md) property to verify the app can transition to the foreground. If you call this method and it’s not possible to transition the app to the foreground, the system throws an [notAllowed](../appintenterror/unrecoverable/notallowed.md) error.
