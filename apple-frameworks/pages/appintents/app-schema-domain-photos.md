# Photos

**Framework:** App Intents  
**Kind:** API Collection

Make your photo and video app’s actions available to Apple Intelligence and Siri by adopting schemas for common photo and video actions.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

The `.photos` domain defines app schemas that provide a structured representation for common photo and video actions and content. Apply schemas in the `.photos` domain to make your app’s photo and video functionality available to Apple Intelligence and Siri. Each schema defines the requirements for intents, parameters, and results so people get a consistent experience across photo and video apps. For example, a person can edit a photo on different apps that support the [editAsset](appschema/photosintent/editasset.md) schema with the same phrases.

Most schemas in this domain operate on assets that are already in your app’s library. The exception is [createAssets](appschema/photosintent/createassets.md), which adds new assets from an external source.

The following table maps example phrases that apply to each schema:

| Photos intent schemas | Example phrases |
| --- | --- |
| [addAssetsToAlbum](appschema/photosintent/addassetstoalbum.md) | “Add DSC_001.JPEG to the 2024 album.” |
| [cleanupPhoto](appschema/photosintent/cleanupphoto.md) | “Clean up.” or “Remove the clutter.” |
| [createAlbum](appschema/photosintent/createalbum.md) | “Create a new album named pics.” |
| [createAssets](appschema/photosintent/createassets.md) | “Save these to my photos.” |
| [crop](appschema/photosintent/crop.md) | “Crop this photo.” or “Trim a bit off the borders.” |
| [deleteAlbum](appschema/photosintent/deletealbum.md) | “Trash this album.” or “Get rid of vacation 2024.” |
| [deleteAssets](appschema/photosintent/deleteassets.md) | “Delete this photo.” or “Get rid of the three most recent photos.” |
| [duplicateAssets](appschema/photosintent/duplicateassets.md) | “Duplicate DSC_001.JPEG.” or “Make a copy of DSC_0123.JPEG.” |
| [editAsset](appschema/photosintent/editasset.md) | “Edit this photo.” |
| [openAlbum](appschema/photosintent/openalbum.md) | “Open the 2024 album.” or “Show me 2024.” |
| [openAsset](appschema/photosintent/openasset.md) | “Open DSC_0123.JPEG.” or “Play IMG_4567.MOV.” |
| [postToSharedAlbum](appschema/photosintent/posttosharedalbum.md) | “Share DSC_001.JPEG to the baby shared album.” |
| [removeAssetsFromAlbum](appschema/photosintent/removeassetsfromalbum.md) | “Remove this photo from my shared album.” |
| [setFilter](appschema/photosintent/setfilter.md) | “Apply the dramatic effect.” or “Remove the filter.” |
| [setRotation](appschema/photosintent/setrotation.md) | “Rotate this photo clockwise.” or “Rotate this photo left.” |
| [setWarmth](appschema/photosintent/setwarmth.md) | “Apply a warmth value of negative fifty.” |
| [straighten](appschema/photosintent/straighten.md) | “Straighten this photo.” or “Make this photo straight.” |
| [toggleSuggestedEdits](appschema/photosintent/togglesuggestededits.md) | “Enhance this photo.” or “Make this photo better.” |
| [updateAlbum](appschema/photosintent/updatealbum.md) | “Rename vacation 2024 to trip.” |

> **Tip**

> Xcode generates a template implementation when you type `photos_` and select a schema from the suggestions list.
