## Discussion

Your app determines the contents of this property using a mechanism you determine fitting to identify the account. Only your app consumes this property and interprets its contents, for example, by ensuring it represents an account with a valid subscription.

To avoid collisions with other tokens, make the contents of sufficient length and complexity. To validate the contents, you can include a cryptographic signature. For example, see the [JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519) specification for a standardized authentication method that features these benefits.

On tvOS, if the framework fails to find a token for the current Apple Account, it also checks the system default Apple Account, if different from the current Apple Account. If the default Apple Account also doesn’t have a token, the system stops looking.

> **Important**

> Apple stores the string value to the Apple Account as is; avoid including sensitive information in the value.
