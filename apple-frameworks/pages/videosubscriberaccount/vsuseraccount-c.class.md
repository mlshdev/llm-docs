## Overview

There are two sources for a `VSUserAccount` instance:

- You create an instance when a person registers a new account or signs into an existing account in your app, and you call [updateUserAccount:completion:](vsuseraccountmanager/updateuseraccount_completion_.md) on [VSUserAccountManager](vsuseraccountmanager.md) with the instance.
- - You fetch user accounts by calling [queryUserAccountsWithOptions:completion:](vsuseraccountmanager/queryuseraccountswithoptions_completion_.md), which can return user accounts created on the current device, or user accounts registered on all the devices signed into the person’s iCloud account.
