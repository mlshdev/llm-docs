# OSLogEntry.StoreCategory.longTermAuto (Swift)

**Framework:** OSLog  
**Kind:** Case  
**Availability:** iOS 15.0+ · iPadOS 15.0+ · Mac Catalyst 15.0+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 15.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 8.0+

The entry was tagged with a hint indicating the system should try to preserve it based on the amount of space available.

## Declaration

```swift
case longTermAuto
```

## Discussion

Instead of tagging a hint with a number of days that the entry should be preserved, the `longTermAuto` case is preserved based on the amount of space available. Therefore, it will automatically make determinations on how long to preserve the entry. Entries using this case should be persisted in a filesystem-backed data store.
