# rightEyeTransform (Swift)

**Framework:** ARKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 12.0+ · iPadOS 12.0+

A transform matrix indicating the position and orientation of the face’s right eye.

## Declaration

```swift
var rightEyeTransform: simd_float4x4 { get }
```

## Discussion

The translation aspect of this matrix indicates the position of the center of the eyeball, relative to the position represented by the anchor’s [transform](../aranchor/transform.md). The positive z-axis points from the center of the eyeball in the direction of the pupil.

Rotational aspects of the matrix indicate the orientation of the eyeball—for example, a rotation about the x-axis directs the pupil upward or downward. The eye does not rotate about the z-axis.
