# blendShapes (Swift)

**Framework:** ARKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 11.0+ · iPadOS 11.0+

A dictionary of named coefficients representing the detected facial expression in terms of the movement of specific facial features.

## Declaration

```swift
var blendShapes: [ARFaceAnchor.BlendShapeLocation : NSNumber] { get }
```

## Discussion

Each key in this dictionary (an [ARFaceAnchor.BlendShapeLocation](blendshapelocation.md) constant) represents one of many specific facial features recognized by ARKit. The corresponding value for each key is a floating point number indicating the current position of that feature relative to its neutral configuration, ranging from `0.0` (neutral) to `1.0` (maximum movement).

You can use blend shape coefficients to animate a 2D or 3D character in ways that follow the user’s facial expressions. ARKit provides many blend shape coefficients, resulting in a detailed model of a facial expression; however, you can use as many or as few of the coefficients as you desire to create a visual effect. For example, you might animate a simple cartoon character using only the [jawOpen](blendshapelocation/jawopen.md), [eyeBlinkLeft](blendshapelocation/eyeblinkleft.md), and [eyeBlinkRight](blendshapelocation/eyeblinkright.md) coefficients. A professional 3D artist could create a detailed character model rigged for realistic animation using a larger set, or the entire set, of coefficients.

You can also use blend shape coefficients to record a specific facial expression and reuse it later. The [ARFaceGeometry](../arfacegeometry.md) [init(blendShapes:)](../arfacegeometry/init%28blendshapes_%29.md) initializer creates a detailed 3D mesh from a dictionary equivalent to this property’s value; the serialized form of a blend shapes dictionary is more portable than that of the face mesh those coefficients describe.
