# hitTest(\_:types:) (Swift)

**Framework:** ARKit  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 11.0+ (deprecated in 14.0) · iPadOS 11.0+ (deprecated in 14.0)

Searches for real-world objects or AR anchors in the captured camera image corresponding to a point in the SpriteKit view.

> Use raycasting

## Declaration

```swift
func hitTest(_ point: CGPoint, types: ARHitTestResult.ResultType) -> [ARHitTestResult]
```

## Parameters

- `point`: A point in the 2D coordinate system of the view.
- `types`: The types of hit-test result to search for.

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

A list of results, sorted from nearest to farthest (in distance from the camera).

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

Hit testing searches for real-world objects or surfaces detected through the AR session’s processing of the camera image. A 2D point in the view’s coordinate system can refer to any point along a 3D line that starts at the device camera and extends in a direction determined by the device orientation and camera projection. This method searches along that line, returning all objects that intersect it in order of distance from the camera.

> **Note**

>  This method searches for AR anchors and real-world objects detected by the AR session, not SpriteKit content displayed in the view. To search for SpriteKit objects, use the [nodes(at:)](../../spritekit/sknode/nodes%28at_%29.md) method of the view’s SpriteKit scene.

The behavior of a hit test depends on which `types` you specify and the order you specify them in. For details, see [ARHitTestResult](../arhittestresult.md) and the various [ARHitTestResult.ResultType](../arhittestresult/resulttype.md) options.
