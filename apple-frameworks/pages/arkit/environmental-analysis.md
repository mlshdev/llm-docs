# Environmental Analysis (Swift)

**Framework:** ARKit  
**Kind:** API Collection

Analyze the video from the cameras and the accompanying data, and use ray-casting and depth-map information to determine the location of items.

## Topics

### Video Frame Analysis

- [Displaying a point cloud using scene depth](displaying-a-point-cloud-using-scene-depth.md): Present a visualization of the physical environment by placing points based a scene’s depth data.
- [Creating a fog effect using scene depth](creating-a-fog-effect-using-scene-depth.md): Apply virtual fog to the physical environment.
- [ARFrame](arframe.md): A video image captured as part of a session with position-tracking information.
- [ARPointCloud](arpointcloud.md): A collection of points in the world coordinate space of the AR session.
- [ARDepthData](ardepthdata.md): An object that describes the distance to regions of the real world from the plane of the camera.

### Raycasting

- [Placing objects and handling 3D interaction](placing-objects-and-handling-3d-interaction.md): Place virtual content at tracked, real-world locations, and enable the user to interact with virtual content by using gestures.
- [ARRaycastQuery](arraycastquery.md): A mathematical ray you use to find 3D positions on real-world surfaces.
- [ARTrackedRaycast](artrackedraycast.md): A raycast query that ARKit repeats in succession to give you refined results over time.
- [ARRaycastResult](arraycastresult.md): Information about a real-world surface found by examining a point on the screen.

### Hit-Testing

- [ARHitTestResult](arhittestresult.md): Deprecated. Information about a real-world surface found by examining a point on the screen.

### Virtual Content

- [Content Anchors](content-anchors.md): Identify items in the physical environment, including planar surfaces, images, physical objects, body positions, and faces.
- [Camera, Lighting, and Effects](camera-lighting-and-effects.md): Determine the camera position and lighting for the current session, and apply effects, such as occlusion, to elements of the environment.
- [Data Management](data-management.md): Obtain detailed information about skeletal and face geometry, and saved world data.
- [Creating USD files for Apple devices](../usd/creating-usd-files-for-apple-devices.md): Generate 3D assets that render as expected.
