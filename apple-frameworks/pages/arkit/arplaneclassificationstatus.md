# ARPlaneClassificationStatus

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** ARKit  
**Kind:** Enumeration  
**Availability:** iOS · iPadOS

Possible states of ARKit’s process for classifying plane anchors.

## Declaration

```objectivec
enum ARPlaneClassificationStatus : NSInteger;
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

You get values of this type from a plane anchor’s [classificationStatus](arplaneanchor/classificationstatus.md) property, describing the state of ARKit’s plane classification process.

## Topics

### Classification Status

- [ARPlaneClassificationStatusNotAvailable](arplaneclassificationstatus/arplaneclassificationstatusnotavailable.md): ARKit cannot currently provide plane classification information.
- [ARPlaneClassificationStatusUndetermined](arplaneclassificationstatus/arplaneclassificationstatusundetermined.md): ARKit has not yet produced a classification for the plane anchor.
- [ARPlaneClassificationStatusUnknown](arplaneclassificationstatus/arplaneclassificationstatusunknown.md): ARKit has completed its classification process for the plane anchor, but the result is inconclusive.
- [ARPlaneClassificationStatusKnown](arplaneclassificationstatus/arplaneclassificationstatusknown.md): ARKit has completed its classfication process for the plane anchor.
