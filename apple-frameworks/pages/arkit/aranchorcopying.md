# ARAnchorCopying (Swift)

**Framework:** ARKit  
**Kind:** Protocol  
**Availability:** iOS 12.0+ · iPadOS 12.0+

Support for custom anchor subclasses.

## Declaration

```swift
protocol ARAnchorCopying : NSCopying
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

An [ARAnchor](aranchor.md) (or an instance of any anchor subclass) represents a position and orientation in world space, and optionally associates extra information with that point (like a name, or plane or image detection data). Each time ARKit generates an [ARFrame](arframe.md) object (describing the current environment as of a specific frame of live camera video), ARKit updates the [anchors](arframe/anchors.md) associated with the session as of that moment. Because anchor objects are immutable, ARKit must copy them to make changes from one [ARFrame](arframe.md) to the next.

If you create your own ARAnchor subclass, you must implement the [init(anchor:)](aranchorcopying/init%28anchor_%29.md) initializer required by this protocol. To ensure that any custom information in your subclass is maintained between successive frames, your implementation should copy any custom properties it declares.

## Topics

### Copying Anchors

- [init(anchor:)](aranchorcopying/init%28anchor_%29.md): Initializes a new anchor by copying custom information from another anchor.

## Relationships

### Inherits From

### Common Types

- [ARTrackable](artrackable.md): An interface for objects that track the location of real-world objects or locations.
