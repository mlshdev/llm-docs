# ARPlaneClassification

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** ARKit  
**Kind:** Enumeration  
**Availability:** iOS · iPadOS

Possible characterizations of real-world surfaces represented by plane anchors.

## Declaration

```objectivec
enum ARPlaneClassification : NSInteger;
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

You get values of this type from a plane anchor’s [classification](arplaneanchor/classification-2hi2p.md) property, identifying the likely type of real-world surface for a detected plane anchor.

## Topics

### Plane Classifications

- [ARPlaneClassificationNone](arplaneclassification/arplaneclassificationnone.md): No classification is available for the plane anchor.
- [ARPlaneClassificationWall](arplaneclassification/arplaneclassificationwall.md): The plane anchor represents a real-world wall or similar large vertical surface.
- [ARPlaneClassificationFloor](arplaneclassification/arplaneclassificationfloor.md): The plane anchor represents a real-world floor, ground plane, or similar large horizontal surface.
- [ARPlaneClassificationCeiling](arplaneclassification/arplaneclassificationceiling.md): The plane anchor represents a real-world ceiling or similar overhead horizontal surface.
- [ARPlaneClassificationTable](arplaneclassification/arplaneclassificationtable.md): The plane anchor represents a real-world table, desk, bar, or similar flat surface.
- [ARPlaneClassificationSeat](arplaneclassification/arplaneclassificationseat.md): The plane anchor represents a real-world chair, stool, bench or similar flat surface.
- [ARPlaneClassificationDoor](arplaneclassification/arplaneclassificationdoor.md): The plane anchor represents a real-world door, or similar archway.
- [ARPlaneClassificationWindow](arplaneclassification/arplaneclassificationwindow.md): The plane anchor fits the description of a real-world window.
