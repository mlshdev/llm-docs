# Configuration Objects (Swift)

**Framework:** ARKit  
**Kind:** API Collection

Configure your augmented reality session to detect and track specific types of content.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Configuration objects define how ARKit sets up and runs your augmented reality session. Although [ARWorldTrackingConfiguration](arworldtrackingconfiguration.md) provides the widest range of features in a rear-camera experience, each feature consumes device energy and compute cycles. So to maximize device uptime and performance, enable additional options sparingly.

If another AR configuration fulfills your requirements with a more concise feature set, use that configuration instead. For example, use [ARBodyTrackingConfiguration](arbodytrackingconfiguration.md) instead of a world-tracking configuration for 3D motion-capture if you don’t need user face-tracking, collaboration, or scene reconstruction.

<a id="Select-frame-features"></a>

### Select frame features

Some configurations support subfeatures that relate to a session’s frame. Enable these features by setting the following flags in the configuration’s [frameSemantics](arconfiguration/framesemantics-swift.property.md):

- **[bodyDetection](arconfiguration/framesemantics-swift.struct/bodydetection.md)**: Enables 2D human body tracking.
- **[personSegmentation](arconfiguration/framesemantics-swift.struct/personsegmentation.md)**: Enables people occlusion.
- **[personSegmentationWithDepth](arconfiguration/framesemantics-swift.struct/personsegmentationwithdepth.md)**: Enables people occlusion based on whether the people in the camera feed are closer to the camera than the virtual content.

Use [supportsFrameSemantics(\_:)](arconfiguration/supportsframesemantics%28__%29.md) to verify whether the iOS device supports the [ARConfiguration.FrameSemantics](arconfiguration/framesemantics-swift.struct.md) you desire before setting [frameSemantics](arconfiguration/framesemantics-swift.property.md).

> **Important**

>  To maximize device responsiveness, refrain from turning on people occlusion for single-user experiences when you don’t expect people in the scene.

<a id="Switch-configurations-at-runtime"></a>

### Switch configurations at runtime

To toggle features like plane detection, frame semantics, and environment texturing, you switch your configuration at runtime by calling [runWithConfiguration:](arsession/runwithconfiguration_.md) on your existing session. Where possible, ARKit maintains all the information collected during the session under the prior configuration, such as information about the physical environment and anchors.

> **Tip**

>  You can gracefully downgrade the AR experience in the event of low-power or thermal events. For example, you could temporarily switch from a world-tracking configuration to a position-tracking configuration ([ARPositionalTrackingConfiguration](arpositionaltrackingconfiguration.md)) if your app can function at a basic level in that limited capacity until the device cools down.

If your session switches between face- and world-tracking configurations, the session doesn’t maintain state.

### Enable high-quality video and custom capture settings

In iOS 16, you can enable a 4K and high dynamic range (HDR) video format. In addition, you can customize your session’s video settings through the underlying AV capture device.

To determine whether your session supports 4K, call [recommendedVideoFormatFor4KResolution](arconfiguration/recommendedvideoformatfor4kresolution.md).

```swift
guard let hiResFormat = ARWorldTrackingConfiguration.recommendedVideoFormatFor4KResolution else {
   print("4K video format not supported."); return }
```

Then, create a configuration with the format. You can also indicate the intent to enable HDR by setting [videoHDRAllowed](arconfiguration/videohdrallowed.md) to `true`.

```swift
var config = ARWorldTrackingConfiguration()
config.videoFormat = hiResFormat
config.videoHDRAllowed = true
session.run(config)
```

If the device supports a configurable capture session, the [configurableCaptureDeviceForPrimaryCamera](arconfiguration/configurablecapturedeviceforprimarycamera.md) provides the underlying capture device that you can adjust as needed.

```swift
if let device = ARWorldTrackingConfiguration.configurableCaptureDeviceForPrimaryCamera {
   do { try device.lockForConfiguration()
      // Configure capture settings here.
      device.unlockForConfiguration()
   } catch { /* Error handling. */ }
}
```

### Capture high-resolution still frames

In iOS 16, you can enable high-resolution frame capture by calling [recommendedVideoFormatForHighResolutionFrameCapturing](arconfiguration/recommendedvideoformatforhighresolutionframecapturing.md) on your configuration. If the device supports high-resolution stills, the function returns a video format you can use to start a session:

```swift
guard let hiResFormat = type(of: config).recommendedVideoFormatForHighResolutionFrameCapturing else {
    fatalError("The device doesn't support high-resolution stills.") }
config.videoFormat = hiResFormat
arSession.run(config)
```

During the session, capture a high-resolution still frame at any time by calling [captureHighResolutionFrame(completion:)](arsession/capturehighresolutionframe%28completion_%29.md):

```swift
arSession.captureHighResolutionFrame { (frame, error) in
    if let frame = frame {
        saveHiResFrame(frame)
    } else { /* Error handling. */ }
```
