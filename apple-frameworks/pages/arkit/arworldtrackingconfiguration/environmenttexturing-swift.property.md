# environmentTexturing (Swift)

**Framework:** ARKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 12.0+ · iPadOS 12.0+

An option that determines how the framework generates environment textures.

## Declaration

```swift
var environmentTexturing: ARWorldTrackingConfiguration.EnvironmentTexturing { get set }
```

## Discussion

Environment textures are cube-map textures that depict the view in all directions from a specific point in a scene. In 3D asset rendering, environment textures are the basis for image-based lighting algorithms where surfaces can realistically reflect light from their surroundings. ARKit generates environment textures during an AR session using camera imagery, allowing SceneKit or a custom-rendering engine to provide realistic image-based lighting for virtual objects in your AR experience.

To enable texture map generation for your configuration, change this property (from its default value of [ARWorldTrackingConfiguration.EnvironmentTexturing.none](environmenttexturing-swift.enum/none.md)):

- With [ARWorldTrackingConfiguration.EnvironmentTexturing.manual](environmenttexturing-swift.enum/manual.md) environment texturing, you identify points in the scene for which you want light probe texture maps by creating [AREnvironmentProbeAnchor](../arenvironmentprobeanchor.md) objects and adding them to the session.
- With [ARWorldTrackingConfiguration.EnvironmentTexturing.automatic](environmenttexturing-swift.enum/automatic.md) environment texturing, ARKit automatically creates, positions, and adds [AREnvironmentProbeAnchor](../arenvironmentprobeanchor.md) objects to the session.

In both cases, ARKit automatically generates environment textures as the session collects camera imagery. Use a delegate method such as [session(\_:didUpdate:)](../arsessiondelegate/session%28__didupdate_%29-3qtt8.md) to find out when a texture is available, and access it from the anchor’s [environmentTexture](../arenvironmentprobeanchor/environmenttexture.md) property.

If you display AR content using [ARSCNView](../arscnview.md) and the [automaticallyUpdatesLighting](../arscnview/automaticallyupdateslighting.md) option, SceneKit automatically retrieves [AREnvironmentProbeAnchor](../arenvironmentprobeanchor.md) texture maps and uses them to light the scene.
