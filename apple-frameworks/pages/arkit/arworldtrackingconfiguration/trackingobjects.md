# trackingObjects (Swift)

**Framework:** ARKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 27.0+ · iPadOS 27.0+

Objects to track in the scene.

## Declaration

```swift
var trackingObjects: Set<ARReferenceObject> { get set }
```

<a id="discussion"></a>

## Discussion

The system tracks the object at the full frame rate of the selected `videoFormat`. When an object is tracked, an `ARObjectAnchor` is added to the session.

Use this property for moving or handheld objects that require precise, per-frame pose updates. High frame-rate tracking significantly increases power consumption and processing load. For mostly stationary objects, use `detectionObjects` instead.

> **Note**

> Only the `.referenceobject` format (introduced in iOS 27) is supported; the older `.arobject` format works only with `detectionObjects`. A single session can’t use both formats.
