# capturedDepthData (Swift)

**Framework:** ARKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 11.0+ · iPadOS 11.0+

Depth data captured in front-camera experiences.

## Declaration

```swift
var capturedDepthData: AVDepthData? { get }
```

## Discussion

Frames vended by the session contain a depth map captured by the depth sensor in addition to the color pixel buffer (see [capturedImage](capturedimage.md)) captured by the color camera. The depth-sensing camera provides data at a different frame rate than the color camera, so this property’s value can be `nil` if no depth data was captured at the same time as the current color image.

This depth data is available only in face-based experiences (see [ARFaceTrackingConfiguration](../arfacetrackingconfiguration.md)) using the device’s front TrueDepth camera. This property’s value is `nil` when running other AR configurations.

- [rawFeaturePoints](rawfeaturepoints.md): The current intermediate results of the scene analysis ARKit uses to perform world tracking.
- [capturedDepthDataTimestamp](captureddepthdatatimestamp.md): The time at which depth data for the frame (if any) was captured.
- [sceneDepth](scenedepth.md): Data on the distance between a device’s rear camera and real-world objects in an AR experience.
- [smoothedSceneDepth](smoothedscenedepth.md): An average of distance measurements between a device’s rear camera and real-world objects that creates smoother visuals in an AR experience.
