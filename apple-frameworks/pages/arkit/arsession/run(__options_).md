# run(\_:options:) (Swift)

**Framework:** ARKit  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 11.0+ · iPadOS 11.0+

Starts AR processing for the session with the specified configuration and options.

## Declaration

```swift
func run(_ configuration: ARConfiguration, options: ARSession.RunOptions = [])
```

## Parameters

- `configuration`: An object that defines motion and scene tracking behaviors for the session.
- `options`: Options affecting how existing session state (if any) transitions to the new configuration.

  If the session is running for the first time, this parameter has no effect.

## Discussion

The session tracks device motion, captures and processes scene imagery from the device camera, and coordinates with your [delegate](delegate.md) object or [ARSCNView](../arscnview.md) or [ARSKView](../arskview.md) view only when running.

Calling this method on a session that has already started transitions immediately to the new session configuration. The `options` parameter determines how existing session state transitions to the new configuration. By default, the session resumes device position tracking from the last known state and keeps any anchors already included in the session (those you’ve added manually with [add(anchor:)](add%28anchor_%29.md), as well as those added automatically by ARKit features such as plane detection or face tracking).

This method returns immediately when called, but the session continues to run.
