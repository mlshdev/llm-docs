# classification

**Framework:** ARKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 12.0+ · iPadOS 12.0+

A general characterization of what kind of real-world surface the plane anchor represents.

## Declaration

```swift
var classification: ARPlaneAnchor.Classification { get }
```

## Discussion

On supported devices, ARKit automatically attempts to characterize each detected plane, describing it as a real-world surface such as a wall, floor, or table. You can then use this information to enhance the realism of your AR experience; for example, by placing certain virtual content only on floors.

Plane classification can take longer than plane detection, and ARKit reports classifications only for planes where it has a high confidence in the result. If ARKit currently has no classification result for a plane, this property’s value is [ARPlaneAnchor.Classification.none(\_:)](classification-swift.enum/none%28__%29.md), with an associated [ARPlaneAnchor.Classification.Status](classification-swift.enum/status.md) value indicating why.

Plane classification is available only on iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPhone XR. Before using classification results, check the [isClassificationSupported](isclassificationsupported.md) class property to make sure you’re on a supported device.
