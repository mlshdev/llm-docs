## Discussion

Plane classification is available only on iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max devices. On other devices, all plane anchors always indicate a classification status of [ARPlaneAnchor.Classification.Status.notAvailable](notavailable.md).

A classification status of [ARPlaneAnchor.Classification.Status.notAvailable](notavailable.md) can also occur if the plane classification process is temporarily unavilable.
