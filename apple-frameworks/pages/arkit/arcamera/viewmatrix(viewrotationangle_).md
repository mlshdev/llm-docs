# viewMatrix(viewRotationAngle:) (Swift)

**Framework:** ARKit  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 27.0+ · iPadOS 27.0+

Returns the view matrix for the camera with a given view angle.

## Declaration

```swift
func viewMatrix(viewRotationAngle: CGFloat) -> simd_float4x4
```

## Parameters

- `viewRotationAngle`: The view rotation angle, in degrees, that will be used to render the camera’s view.

## Return Value

The view matrix for the given view angle.

## Discussion

The view matrix can be used to transform geometry from world space into camera space for a given view angle.

The view angle, in degrees, is the clockwise rotation needed to keep the camera image level with the horizon (`0` LandscapeRight, `90` Portrait, `180` LandscapeLeft, `270` PortraitUpsideDown). Obtain it from `ARSession.viewRotationAngle`.
