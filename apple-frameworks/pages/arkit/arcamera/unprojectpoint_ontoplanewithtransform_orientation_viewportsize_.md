# unprojectPoint:ontoPlaneWithTransform:orientation:viewportSize:

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** ARKit  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 12.0+ (deprecated in 27.0) · iPadOS 12.0+ (deprecated in 27.0)

Returns the projection of a point from the 2D space of a view rendering the scene onto a plane in the 3D world space detected by ARKit.

## Declaration

```objectivec
- (simd_float3) unprojectPoint:(CGPoint) point ontoPlaneWithTransform:(simd_float4x4) planeTransform orientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation) orientation viewportSize:(CGSize) viewportSize;
```

## Parameters

- `point`: The point in 2D view space to project onto a plane.

  The coordinate space for this point has its origin is in the upper left corner and a size matching the `viewportSize` parameter.
- `planeTransform`: A transform matrix specifying the position and orientation of a plane (with infinite extent) in 3D world space. The plane is the xz-plane of the local coordinate space this transform defines.
- `orientation`: The orientation in which the camera image is to be presented.
- `viewportSize`: The size, in points, of the view in which the camera image is to be presented.

## Return Value

The 3D point in world space where a ray projected from the specified 2D point intersects the specified plane. If the ray does not intersect the plane, this method returns a `float3` vector where all elements are `NaN`.

## Discussion

If you display AR content with SceneKit, the [ARSCNView](../arscnview.md) class provides an otherwise equivalent [unprojectPoint:ontoPlaneWithTransform:](../arscnview/unprojectpoint_ontoplanewithtransform_.md) method that requires fewer parameters (because the view can infer its orientation and size).

### Applying Camera Geometry

- [projectionMatrix](projectionmatrix.md): A transform matrix appropriate for rendering 3D content to match the image captured by the camera.
