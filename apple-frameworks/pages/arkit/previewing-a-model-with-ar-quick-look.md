# Previewing a Model with AR Quick Look (Swift)

**Framework:** ARKit  
**Kind:** Article

Display a model or scene that the user can move, scale, and share with others.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

AR Quick Look enables the user to place virtual content that you provide on any surface that ARKit finds in the real-world environment. Users can interact with your virtual content by moving and scaling it using touch gestures, or by sharing it with others through the iOS share sheet.

<a id="Choose-an-Input-Format"></a>

### Choose an Input Format

You provide content for your AR experience in `.usdz` or `.reality` format:

- To browse a library of `.usdz` files, see the [AR Quick Look Gallery](https://developer.apple.com/arkit/gallery/).
- To browse a library of `.reality` assets, use Reality Composer. For more information, see `Creating 3D Content with Reality Composer`.

> **Note**

>  If you include a Reality Composer file (`.rcproject`) in your app’s Copy Files build phase, Xcode automatically outputs a converted `.reality` file in your app bundle at build time.

### Display an AR Experience in Your App

In your app, you enable AR Quick Look by providing [QLPreviewController](../quicklook/qlpreviewcontroller.md) with a supported input file. The following code demonstrates previewing a scene named `myScene` from the app bundle.

```swift
import UIKit
import QuickLook
import ARKit

class ViewController: UIViewController, QLPreviewControllerDataSource {

    override func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
        let previewController = QLPreviewController()
        previewController.dataSource = self
        present(previewController, animated: true, completion: nil)
    }

    func numberOfPreviewItems(in controller: QLPreviewController) -> Int { return 1 }

    func previewController(_ controller: QLPreviewController, previewItemAt index: Int) -> QLPreviewItem {
        guard let path = Bundle.main.path(forResource: "myScene", ofType: "reality") else { fatalError("Couldn't find the supported input file.") }
        let url = URL(fileURLWithPath: path)
        return url as QLPreviewItem
    }    
}
```

To prevent the user from scaling your virtual content or to customize the default share sheet behavior, use [ARQuickLookPreviewItem](../quicklook/arquicklookpreviewitem.md) instead of [QLPreviewItem](../quicklook/qlpreviewitem.md).

### Display an AR Experience in Your Web Page

In your web page, you enable AR Quick Look by linking a supported input file.

```javascript
<div>
    <a rel="ar" href="/assets/models/my-model.usdz">
        <img src="/assets/models/my-model-thumbnail.jpg">
    </a>
</div>
```

When the user clicks the link in Safari or within a web view that’s displayed in your app, iOS presents your scene in an AR Quick Look view on your behalf.
