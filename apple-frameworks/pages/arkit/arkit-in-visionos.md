<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

ARKit in visionOS offers a new set of sensing capabilities that you adopt individually in your app, using data providers to deliver updates asynchronously. The available capabilities include:

- **Plane detection.** Detect surfaces in a person’s surroundings and use them to anchor content.
- **World tracking.** Determine the position and orientation of Apple Vision Pro relative to its surroundings, and add world anchors to place content.
- **Hand tracking.** Use a person’s hand and finger positions as input for custom gestures and interactivity.
- **Scene reconstruction.** Build a mesh of a person’s physical surroundings and incorporate it into your immersive spaces to support interactions.
- **Image tracking.** Look for known images in a person’s surroundings and use them as anchor points for custom content.
- **Object tracking.** Use 3D reference objects to find and track real-world objects in a person’s environment.
- **Barcode detection.** Detect and scan QR codes and barcodes in a variety of formats in a person’s surroundings.
- **Room tracking**. Use room anchors to identify specific rooms and implement per-room experiences.
- **Light estimation.** Understand the lighting characteristics of a room to help improve the appearance of shiny or semi-reflective materials in your virtual content.
- **Camera frames.** Access camera frames from a device in several formats.
- **Accessory tracking.** Work with the real-time position and orientation of accessories that a person is using.
