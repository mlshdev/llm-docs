# CNDetection

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** Cinematic  
**Kind:** Class  
**Availability:** iOS 17.0+ · iPadOS 17.0+ · Mac Catalyst 17.0+ · macOS 14.0+ · tvOS 17.0+

A structure that represents a detected subject, face, torso or pet at a particular time.

## Declaration

```objectivec
@interface CNDetection : NSObject
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Specifies the type, distance bounds, and time of the detection. Detections obtained from the Cinematic script include a unique number that can tracks the detection over time.

Some types of detections also include a unique group number that associates related detections (for example, the face and torso of the same person).

## Topics

### Instance Properties

- [detectionGroupID](cndetection-c.class/detectiongroupid.md): A unique number representing the detection to focus on if this is a group decision.
- [detectionID](cndetection-c.class/detectionid.md): An unique identifier assigned by the Cinematic script to all detections of the same subject and detection type across time.
- [detectionType](cndetection-c.class/detectiontype.md): The type of object detected, such as the face, torso, cat, dog, and so on.
- [focusDisparity](cndetection-c.class/focusdisparity.md): The disparity to use in order to focus on the object.
- [normalizedRect](cndetection-c.class/normalizedrect.md): The rectangle within the image where the object occurs, normalized such that (0.0, 0.0) is the top-left and (1.0, 1.0) is the bottom-right.
- [time](cndetection-c.class/time.md): The first presentation time which the subject should be in focus.

### Instance Methods

- [initWithTime:detectionType:normalizedRect:focusDisparity:](cndetection-c.class/initwithtime_detectiontype_normalizedrect_focusdisparity_.md): Creates a Cinematic detection of a subject.

### Type Methods

- [accessibilityLabelForDetectionType:](cndetection-c.class/accessibilitylabelfordetectiontype_.md): A localized accessibility label converting a specific detection type into a broad category such as a person, pet, and so on.
- [disparityInNormalizedRect:sourceDisparity:detectionType:priorDisparity:](cndetection-c.class/disparityinnormalizedrect_sourcedisparity_detectiontype_priordisparity_.md): Determines the disparity to use to focus on the object in the rectangle.
- [isValidDetectionGroupID:](cndetection-c.class/isvaliddetectiongroupid_.md): Determines whether a given detection group ID is valid.
- [isValidDetectionID:](cndetection-c.class/isvaliddetectionid_.md): Determines whether a given detection ID is valid.

- [CNDecision](cndecision-c.class.md): An object that represents a decision to focus on a particular detection, or group of detections, at a particular time.
- [CNDetectionTrack](cndetectiontrack-61x7g.md): An object representing a series of detections of the same subject over time.
- [CNFixedDetectionTrack](cnfixeddetectiontrack-5aei2.md): An object representing the fixed detection track.
- [CNCustomDetectionTrack](cncustomdetectiontrack-891hc.md): An object representing a discrete detection track composed of individual detections.
- [CNDetectionType](cndetectiontype.md): The type of object detected, such as face, torso, cat, dog and so on.
