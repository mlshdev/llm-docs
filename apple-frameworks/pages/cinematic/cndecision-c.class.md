**Kind:** Class  
**Availability:** iOS 17.0+ · iPadOS 17.0+ · Mac Catalyst 17.0+ · macOS 14.0+ · tvOS 17.0+

An object that represents a decision to focus on a particular detection, or group of detections, at a particular time.

## Declaration

```objectivec
@interface CNDecision : NSObject
```

## Topics

### Instance Properties

- [detectionGroupID](cndecision-c.class/detectiongroupid.md): A unique number representing the detection to focus on if this is a group decision.
- [detectionID](cndecision-c.class/detectionid.md): The unique ID representing the detection to focus on if this isn’t a group decision.
- [groupDecision](cndecision-c.class/groupdecision.md): A flag representing whether this is a group decision.
- [strongDecision](cndecision-c.class/strongdecision.md): A flag representing whether this is a strong decision.
- [time](cndecision-c.class/time.md): The first presentation time that the subject should be in focus.
- [userDecision](cndecision-c.class/userdecision.md): A flag representing whether this is a user-created decision or a base decision.

### Instance Methods

- [initWithTime:detectionGroupID:strong:](cndecision-c.class/initwithtime_detectiongroupid_strong_.md): Makes a decision to focus on the detection with the given unique detection.
- [initWithTime:detectionID:strong:](cndecision-c.class/initwithtime_detectionid_strong_.md): Makes a decision to focus on the best among those detections with the same detection group ID.
