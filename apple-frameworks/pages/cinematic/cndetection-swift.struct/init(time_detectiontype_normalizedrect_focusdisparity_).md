```

## Parameters

- `time`: The presentation time of the frame that the detection occurred.
- `detectionType`: The type of object detected, such as the face, torso, cat, dog, and so on.
- `normalizedRect`: The rectangle within the image where the object occurs, normalized such that (0.0, 0.0) is the top-left and (1.0, 1.0) is the bottom-right.
