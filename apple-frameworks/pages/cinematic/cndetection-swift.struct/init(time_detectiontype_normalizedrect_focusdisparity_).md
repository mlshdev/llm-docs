# init(time:detectionType:normalizedRect:focusDisparity:)

**Framework:** Cinematic  
**Kind:** Initializer  
**Availability:** iOS 17.0+ · iPadOS 17.0+ · Mac Catalyst · macOS 14.0+ · tvOS 17.0+

Creates a Cinematic detection of a subject.

## Declaration

```swift
init(time: CMTime, detectionType: CNDetectionType, normalizedRect: CGRect, focusDisparity: Float)
```

## Parameters

- `time`: The presentation time of the frame that the detection occurred.
- `detectionType`: The type of object detected, such as the face, torso, cat, dog, and so on.
- `normalizedRect`: The rectangle within the image where the object occurs, normalized such that (0.0, 0.0) is the top-left and (1.0, 1.0) is the bottom-right.
- `focusDisparity`: The disparity to use in order to focus on the object.
