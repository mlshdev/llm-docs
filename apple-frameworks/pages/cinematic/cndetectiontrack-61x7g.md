### Instance Properties

- [detectionGroupID](cndetectiontrack-61x7g/detectiongroupid.md): The detection group ID of the subject detected by the track.
- [detectionID](cndetectiontrack-61x7g/detectionid.md): The unique ID of the subject detected during this track.
- [detectionType](cndetectiontrack-61x7g/detectiontype.md): The type of object that’s detected.
- [discrete](cndetectiontrack-61x7g/discrete.md): A flag determining if the detection track has discrete detections, otherwise continuous.
- [userCreated](cndetectiontrack-61x7g/usercreated.md): A flag indicating if the client created the detection track.

### Instance Methods

- [detectionAtOrBeforeTime:](cndetectiontrack-61x7g/detectionatorbeforetime_.md): Returns the array of detections in the detection track before a given time.
- [detectionNearestTime:](cndetectiontrack-61x7g/detectionnearesttime_.md): Returns the array of detections in the detection track nearest a given time.
- [detectionsInTimeRange:](cndetectiontrack-61x7g/detectionsintimerange_.md): Returns the array of detections in the detection track within the given time range.
