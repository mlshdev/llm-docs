## Discussion

When YES, the output asset references the color and audio sample data from the source asset. This keeps the intermediate file small, but the output asset will not be portable — it depends on the source asset remaining at its original location.

When NO (the default), the color and audio sample data is copied into the output asset, making it self-contained and portable at the cost of roughly doubling the storage required.

The disparity and metadata tracks are always embedded regardless of this setting.
