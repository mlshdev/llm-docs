# addWatchFace(at:completionHandler:) (Swift)

**Framework:** ClockKit  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 14.0+ · iPadOS 14.0+ · Mac Catalyst 14.0+ · watchOS 7.0+

Adds a watch face from the app’s bundle.

## Declaration

```swift
func addWatchFace(at fileURL: URL, completionHandler handler: @escaping @Sendable ((any Error)?) -> Void)
```

```swift
func addWatchFace(at fileURL: URL) async throws
```

## Parameters

- `fileURL`: A file URL for a watch face file.
- `handler`: A block that ClockKit calls after adding the watch face. The block takes the following parameter:

## Discussion

Call this method to load a watch face file. The URL must point to a *watch file*, a watch face that your app has downloaded, or a watch face stored in your app bundle. All of the complications on the watch face must come from apps that have a valid App Store ID, such as an app from the App Store or a TestFlight build. If you try to use complications from a development build, the system won’t recognize the development ID as a valid App Store ID.

In iOS, use the [WCSession](../../watchconnectivity/wcsession.md) class’s [isPaired](../../watchconnectivity/wcsession/ispaired.md) method to verify that the user has a paired Apple Watch before presenting UI to share the watch face.

> **Note**

>  Some newer watch faces are not available on Apple Watch Series 3. Additionally, users can only add Nike and Hermès watch faces to the respective hardware. If you share a watch face that isn’t available on all watches running watchOS 7, check for errors when calling [addWatchFace(at:completionHandler:)](addwatchface%28at_completionhandler_%29.md), and provide a fallback face that can be installed on all watches running watchOS 7 or later. For a list of watch faces supported on Apple Watch Series 3, see [Apple Watch faces and their features](https://support.apple.com/guide/watch/faces-and-features-apde9218b440/watchos).

If you call this method on a device that doesn’t support the Watch app or watch faces, this method reports an error.
