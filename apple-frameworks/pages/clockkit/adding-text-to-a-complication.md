## Overview

When creating ClockKit templates with SwiftUI views, [Text](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/text) views adapt their appearance based on the template’s complication family. The system automatically sets the font and size to match other templates in the same family.

### Match the Expected Font Size

Use the default font size as a guide for the type of information your complication displays. For example, the [CLKComplicationTemplateGraphicExtraLargeCircularView](clkcomplicationtemplategraphicextralargecircularview.md) template provides a large canvas for drawing, but it’s intended to present large, easy-to-read content instead of a lot of small, detailed data.

### Use Text Formatters

When displaying dates and times, use [Text.DateStyle](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/text/datestyle) to create localized strings. [Text.DateStyle](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/text/datestyle) also defines formatters such as [relative](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/text/datestyle/relative), [offset](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/text/datestyle/offset), and [timer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/text/datestyle/timer). ClockKit automatically updates information in these formatters, and you can use these formatters when instantiating a [Text](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/text) view.

```swift
Text(myEvent.startDate, style: .timer)
```

Or use them inline in an interpolated string.

```swift
Text("\(myEvent.name) starts in \(myEvent.startDate, style: .timer)")
```
