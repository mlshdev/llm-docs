# IOFireWirePseudoAddressSpaceWriteHandler

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** IOKit  
**Kind:** Type Alias  
**Availability:** Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.0+

Callback called to handle write requests to a pseudo address space.

## Declaration

```objectivec
typedef UInt32 (*IOFireWirePseudoAddressSpaceWriteHandler)(IOFireWireLibPseudoAddressSpaceRef addressSpace, FWClientCommandID commandID, UInt32 packetLen, void *packet, UInt16 srcNodeID, UInt32 destAddressHi, UInt32 destAddressLo, void *refCon);
```

## Parameters

- `addressSpace`: The address space to which the write is being made
- `commandID`: An FWClientCommandID to be passed to ClientCommandIsComplete()
- `packetLen`: Length in bytes of incoming packet
- `packet`: Pointer to the received data
- `srcNodeID`: Node ID of the sender
- `destAddressHi`: high 16 bits of destination address on this computer
- `destAddressLo`: low 32 bits of destination address on this computer
- `refCon`: user specified reference number passed in when the address space was created
