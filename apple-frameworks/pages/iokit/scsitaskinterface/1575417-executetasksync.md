# ExecuteTaskSync

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** IOKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** Mac Catalyst 18.4+ · macOS 10.1+

Method to execute the SCSITask synchronously.

## Declaration

```objectivec
IOReturn (*ExecuteTaskSync)(void *task, SCSI_Sense_Data *senseDataBuffer, SCSITaskStatus *outStatus, UInt64 *realizedTransferCount);
```

## Parameters

- `task`: Pointer to an instance of an SCSITaskInterface.
- `senseDataBuffer`: Pointer to a buffer for REQUEST_SENSE data. May be NULL if caller does not wish to have sense data returned. If caller has previously called SetAutoSenseDataBuffer(), this parameter is ignored.
- `outStatus`: Pointer to an SCSITaskStatus. May be NULL if caller does not wish to have task status returned.
- `realizedTransferCount`: Pointer to an UInt64 which reflects how much data was actually transferred. May be NULL if caller does not wish to know how many bytes were transferred.

## Return Value

Returns a valid IOReturn code such as kIOReturnSuccess, kIOReturnError, kIOReturnVMError, kIOReturnCannotWire, etc. NOTE: IOReturn is defined as kern_return_t and as such, you may get errors back that do not fall under the IOKit subsystem error domain (sys_iokit) defined in IOReturn.h.
