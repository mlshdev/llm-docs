# IOFireWirePseudoAddressSpaceReadHandler

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** IOKit  
**Kind:** Type Alias  
**Availability:** Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.0+

This callback is called to handle read requests to pseudo address spaces. This function should fill in the specified area in the pseudo address space backing store and call ClientCommandIsComplete with the specified command ID

## Declaration

```objectivec
typedef UInt32 (*IOFireWirePseudoAddressSpaceReadHandler)(IOFireWireLibPseudoAddressSpaceRef addressSpace, FWClientCommandID commandID, UInt32 packetLen, UInt32 packetOffset, UInt16 srcNodeID, UInt32 destAddressHi, UInt32 destAddressLo, void *refCon);
```

## Parameters

- `addressSpace`: The address space to which the request is being made
- `commandID`: An FWClientCommandID which should be passed to ClientCommandIsComplete when the buffer has been filled in
- `packetLen`: number of bytes requested
- `packetOffset`: number of bytes from beginning of address space backing store
- `srcNodeID`: nodeID of the requester
- `destAddressHi`: high 16 bits of destination address on this computer
- `destAddressLo`: low 32 bits of destination address on this computer
- `refCon`: user specified reference number passed in when the address space was created
