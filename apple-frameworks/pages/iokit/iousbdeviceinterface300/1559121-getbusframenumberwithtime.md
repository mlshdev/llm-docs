# GetBusFrameNumberWithTime

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** IOKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** Mac Catalyst 18.4+ · macOS 10.5+

Gets a recent frame number of the bus to which the device is attached, along with a system time corresponding to the start of that frame

## Declaration

```objectivec
IOReturn (*GetBusFrameNumberWithTime)(void *self, UInt64 *frame, AbsoluteTime *atTime);
```

## Parameters

- `self`: Pointer to the IOUSBDeviceInterface.
- `frame`: Pointer to UInt64 to hold the frame number.
