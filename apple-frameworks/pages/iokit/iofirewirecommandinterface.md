## Overview

Represents an object that is configured and submitted to issue synchronous and asynchronous bus commands. This is a superclass containing all command object functionality not specific to any kind of bus transaction.

Note that data may not always be transferred to or from the data buffer for command objects at the time the command is submitted. In some cases the transfer may happen as soon as SetBuffer() (below, v2 interfaces and newer) is called. You can use the SetFlags() call (below, v2 interfaces and newer) to control this behavior.
