```

## Overview

Represents a FireWire isochronous talker or listener within the local machine. Isochronous transfer is controlled by an associated DCL (Data Stream Control Language) program, which is similar to a hardware DMA program but is hardware agnostic. DCL programs can be written using the IOFireWireDCLCommandPoolInterface object.

This interface contains all methods of IOFireWireIsochPortInterface and IOFireWireLocalIsochPortInterface. This interface will contain all v2 methods of IOFireWireLocalIsochPortInterface when instantiated as v2 or newer.

Transfer buffers for the local isoch port must all come from a single allocation made with vm_allocate() or mmap(..., MAP_ANON ).

Calling vm_deallocate() on the buffers before deallocating a local isoch port object may result in a deadlock.

Note: Calling Release() on the local isoch port may not immediately release the isoch port; so it may not be safe to call vm_deallocate() on your transfer buffers. To guarantee the port has been release, run the isochronous runloop until the port is finalized (it has processed any pending callbacks). The finalize callback will be called when the port is finalized. Set the finalize callback using SetFinalizeCallback().
