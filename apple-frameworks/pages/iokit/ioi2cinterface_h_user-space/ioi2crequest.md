# IOI2CRequest

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** IOKit

A structure defining an I2C bus transaction.

## Declaration

```objectivec
struct IOI2CRequest {
   IOOptionBits sendTransactionType;
   IOOptionBits replyTransactionType;
   uint32_t sendAddress;
   uint32_t replyAddress;
   uint8_t sendSubAddress;
   uint8_t replySubAddress;
   uint8_t __reservedA[2];
   uint64_t minReplyDelay;
   IOReturn result;
   IOOptionBits commFlags;
   #if defined(__LP64__)
   uint32_t __padA;
   #else
   vm_address_t sendBuffer;
   #endif
   uint32_t sendBytes;
   uint32_t __reservedB[2];
   #if defined(__LP64__)
   uint32_t __padB;
   #else
   vm_address_t replyBuffer;
   #endif
   uint32_t replyBytes;
   IOI2CRequestCompletion completion;
   #if !defined(__LP64__)
   uint32_t __padC[5];
   #else
   vm_address_t sendBuffer;
   vm_address_t replyBuffer;
   #endif
   uint32_t __reservedC[10];
   #ifdef __ppc__
   uint32_t __reservedD;
   #endif
};

## Overview

This structure is used to request an I2C transaction consisting of a send (write) to and reply (read) from a device, either of which is optional, to be carried out atomically on an I2C bus.

## Topics

### Fields

- [\__reservedA](ioi2crequest/1812650-_reserveda.md): Set to zero.
- [result](../ioi2crequest/1410361-result.md): The result of the transaction. Common errors are kIOReturnNoDevice if there is no device responding at the given address, kIOReturnUnsupportedMode if the type of transaction is unsupported on the requested bus.
- [completion](../ioi2crequest/1410371-completion.md): A completion routine to be executed when the request completes. If NULL is passed, the request is synchronous, otherwise it may execute asynchronously.
- [commFlags](../ioi2crequest/1410364-commflags.md): Flags that modify the I2C transaction type.
- [minReplyDelay](../ioi2crequest/1410394-minreplydelay.md): Minimum delay as absolute time between send and reply transactions.
- [sendAddress](../ioi2crequest/1410312-sendaddress.md): I2C address to write.
- [sendSubAddress](../ioi2crequest/1410339-sendsubaddress.md): I2C subaddress to write.
- [\__reservedB](ioi2crequest/1812670-_reservedb.md): Set to zero.
- [sendTransactionType](../ioi2crequest/1410320-sendtransactiontype.md): Specifies one of three possible transaction types.
- [sendBuffer](../ioi2crequest/1410343-sendbuffer.md): Pointer to the send buffer.
- [sendBytes](../ioi2crequest/1410347-sendbytes.md): Number of bytes to send. Set to actual bytes sent on completion of the request.
- [replyAddress](../ioi2crequest/1410325-replyaddress.md): I2C Address from which to read.
- [replySubAddress](../ioi2crequest/1410358-replysubaddress.md): I2C Address from which to read.
- [\__reservedC](ioi2crequest/1812697-_reservedc.md): Set to zero.
- [replyTransactionType](../ioi2crequest/1410310-replytransactiontype.md): Specifies one of four possible reply transaction types.
- [replyBuffer](../ioi2crequest/1410352-replybuffer.md): Pointer to the reply buffer.
- [replyBytes](../ioi2crequest/1410355-replybytes.md): Max bytes to reply (size of replyBuffer). Set to actual bytes received on completion of the request.
- [\__reservedD](ioi2crequest/1812723-_reservedd.md): Set to zero.
