## Discussion

The supplied callback is called when a login attempt has completed. "status" in the callback's params should be checked to determine the success or failure of the login attempt. The "refCon" field in the params will return the refcon set with setRefCon. If "statusBlock" is non-null then login status was written and it has been supplied here. If the login attempt was successful then the login response will be supplied in the "loginResponse" buffer. Note: all buffers supplied to callbacks are only valid for the duration of the callback. Also, you are not to modify the contents of any supplied buffer.
