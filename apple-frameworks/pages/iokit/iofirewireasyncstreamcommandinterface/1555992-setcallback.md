# SetCallback

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** IOKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.5+

Set the completion handler to be called once the command completes asynchronous execution .

## Declaration

```objectivec
void (*SetCallback)(IOFireWireLibCommandRef self, IOFireWireLibCommandCallback inCallback);
```

## Parameters

- `self`: The command object interface of interest
- `inCallback`: A callback handler. Passing nil forces the command object to execute synchronously.
