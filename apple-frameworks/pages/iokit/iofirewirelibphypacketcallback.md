```

## Parameters

### Callbacks

- [IOFireWireBusResetDoneHandler](iofirewirebusresetdonehandler.md): Called when a bus reset has occured and FireWire has completed configuring the bus.
- [IOFireWireBusResetHandler](iofirewirebusresethandler.md): Called when a bus reset has occured, but before FireWire has completed configuring the bus.
- [IOFireWireLibCommandCallback](iofirewirelibcommandcallback.md): Callback called when an asynchronous command has completed executing
- [IOFireWireLibIRMAllocationLostNotificationProc](iofirewirelibirmallocationlostnotificationproc.md): Callback called when an IOFireWireLibIRMAllocationRef fails to reclaim IRM resources after a bus-reset
