typedef void (*IOFireWirePseudoAddressSpaceSkippedPacketHandler)(IOFireWireLibPseudoAddressSpaceRef addressSpace, FWClientCommandID commandID, UInt32 skippedPacketCount);
```

## Parameters

- `addressSpace`: The address space which dropped the packet(s)
- `commandID`: An FWClientCommandID to be passed to ClientCommandIsComplete()
- `skippedPacketCount`: The number of skipped packets

- [IOFireWireBusResetHandler](iofirewirebusresethandler.md): Called when a bus reset has occured, but before FireWire has completed configuring the bus.
- [IOFireWireLibCommandCallback](iofirewirelibcommandcallback.md): Callback called when an asynchronous command has completed executing
- [IOFireWireLibIRMAllocationLostNotificationProc](iofirewirelibirmallocationlostnotificationproc.md): Callback called when an IOFireWireLibIRMAllocationRef fails to reclaim IRM resources after a bus-reset
- [IOFireWireLibPHYPacketCallback](iofirewirelibphypacketcallback.md): Callback called to handle incoming PHY packets
- [IOFireWireLibPHYPacketSkippedCallback](iofirewirelibphypacketskippedcallback.md): Callback called when incoming packets have been dropped from the internal queue
- [IOFireWirePseudoAddressSpaceReadHandler](iofirewirepseudoaddressspacereadhandler.md): This callback is called to handle read requests to pseudo address spaces.
