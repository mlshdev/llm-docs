# ReadDiscStructure

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** IOKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** Mac Catalyst 18.4+ · macOS 10.1+

Issues a READ_DISC_STRUCTURE command to the device as defined in MMC-5.

## Declaration

```objectivec
IOReturn (*ReadDiscStructure)(void *self, SCSICmdField4Bit MEDIA_TYPE, SCSICmdField4Byte ADDRESS, SCSICmdField1Byte LAYER_NUMBER, SCSICmdField1Byte FORMAT, void *buffer, SCSICmdField2Byte bufferSize, SCSITaskStatus *taskStatus, SCSI_Sense_Data *senseDataBuffer);
```

## Parameters

- `self`: Pointer to an MMCDeviceInterface for one IOService.
- `MEDIA_TYPE`: The MEDIA_TYPE field as defined in MMC-5.
- `ADDRESS`: The ADDRESS field as defined in MMC-5.
- `LAYER_NUMBER`: The LAYER_NUMBER field as defined in MMC-5.
- `FORMAT`: The FORMAT field as defined in MMC-5.
- `buffer`: Pointer to the buffer to be used for this function.
- `bufferSize`: The size of the data transfer requested.
- `taskStatus`: Pointer to a SCSITaskStatus to get the status of the SCSITask which was executed. Valid SCSITaskStatus values are defined in SCSITask.h
- `senseDataBuffer`: Pointer to a buffer the size of the SCSI_Sense_Data struct found in SCSICmds_REQUEST_SENSE_Defs.h. The sense data is only valid if the SCSITaskStatus is kSCSITaskStatus_CHECK_CONDITION.

## Return Value

Returns kIOReturnSuccess if successful, kIOReturnNoDevice if there is no connection to an IOService, kIOReturnNoMemory if a SCSITask couldn't be created, or kIOReturnExclusiveAccess if the device is already opened for exclusive access by another client.

## Discussion

Once an MMCDeviceInterface is opened the client may send this command to read information about Disc specific structures on the disc.
