# CAAnimationGroup (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Animation  
**Kind:** Class  
**Availability:** iOS 2.0+ · iPadOS 2.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.5+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

An object that allows multiple animations to be grouped and run concurrently.

## Declaration

```swift
class CAAnimationGroup
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

The grouped animations run in the time space specified by the [CAAnimationGroup](caanimationgroup.md) instance.

The duration of the grouped animations are not scaled to the duration of their [CAAnimationGroup](caanimationgroup.md). Instead, the animations are clipped to the duration of the animation group. For example, a 10 second animation grouped within an animation group with a duration of 5 seconds displays only the first 5 seconds of the animation.

The following code shows how you can create a grouped animation containing  opacity and scale animations to fade out a layer while expanding it. The animation starts with an opacity of `1` and a scale of `1` on all axes. As the animation’s scale increases to `(3, 3, 3)`, the opacity drops to `0` and the animated layer vanishes.

```swift
let fadeOut = CABasicAnimation(keyPath: "opacity")
fadeOut.fromValue = 1
fadeOut.toValue = 0
fadeOut.duration = 1
     
let expandScale = CABasicAnimation()
expandScale.keyPath = "transform"
expandScale.valueFunction = CAValueFunction(name: kCAValueFunctionScale)
expandScale.fromValue = [1, 1, 1]
expandScale.toValue = [3, 3, 3]
     
let fadeAndScale = CAAnimationGroup()
fadeAndScale.animations = [fadeOut, expandScale]
fadeAndScale.duration = 1
```

> **Important**

>  The [delegate](caanimation/delegate.md) and [isRemovedOnCompletion](caanimation/isremovedoncompletion.md) properties of animations in the [animations](caanimationgroup/animations.md) array are currently ignored. The [CAAnimationGroup](caanimationgroup.md) delegate does receive these messages.
