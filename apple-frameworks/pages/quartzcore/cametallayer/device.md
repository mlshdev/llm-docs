# device (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Animation  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ · iPadOS 8.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.11+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

This property determines which device object Metal uses to create its [MTLTexture](../../metal/mtltexture.md) objects. When you retrieve a drawable object and its associated texture, you must render to the texture using the same device object.

The default value is `nil`—you must set the device for a layer before rendering.
