# blueRange (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Animation  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 5.0+ · iPadOS 5.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.6+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

The amount by which the blue color component of the cell can vary. Animatable.

## Declaration

```swift
var blueRange: Float { get set }
```

## Discussion

The range specifies the mean amount by which the blue component of the [color](color.md) property can vary for the cell.

The default value of this property value is `0.0`.
