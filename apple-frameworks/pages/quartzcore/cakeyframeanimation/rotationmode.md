# rotationMode (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Animation  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 2.0+ · iPadOS 2.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.5+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

## Discussion

The possible values for this property are described in [Rotation Mode Values](../rotation-mode-values.md). The default value of this property is `nil`, which indicates that objects should not rotate to follow the path.

The effect of setting this property to a non-`nil` value when no path object is supplied is undefined.
