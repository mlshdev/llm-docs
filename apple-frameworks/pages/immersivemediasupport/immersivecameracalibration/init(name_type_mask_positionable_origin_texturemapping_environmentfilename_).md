# init(name:type:mask:positionable:origin:textureMapping:environmentFilename:)

**Framework:** Immersive Media Support  
**Kind:** Initializer  
**Availability:** iOS 26.4+ · iPadOS 26.4+ · Mac Catalyst 26.4+ · macOS 26.0+ · visionOS 26.0+

Creates a mesh based calibration from USDZ data and a image-based mask.

## Declaration

```swift
init(name: String, type: ImmersiveCameraCalibration.CalibrationType, mask: ImmersiveCameraMask? = nil, positionable: Bool = false, origin: ImmersiveCameraCalibration.CameraOrigin = .zero, textureMapping: ImmersiveCameraCalibration.CameraTextureMapping = .identity, environmentFilename: String? = nil)
```

## Parameters

- `name`: The name to identify the calibration.
- `type`: The calibration type providing data to be used as the camera calibration for each eye.
- `mask`: Optional override mask definition describing the mask to be used for this calibration. If no mask is provided, the one inside LensParameters will be used.
- `positionable`: A flag that indicates whether to anchor this calibration in mixed reality 3D space rather than centering it on the person’s eye position.
- `origin`: The position information, in meters, that represents the origin from which to render the calibration in 3D space relative to the person’s eye.
- `textureMapping`: The texture mapping that describes how each section of the video frame maps into the calibration.
- `environmentFilename`: The USDZ filename for calibrations with a backdrop.
