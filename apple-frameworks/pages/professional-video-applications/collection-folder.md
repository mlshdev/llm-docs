## Overview

Use a `collection-folder` element to describe a collection folder in an event. A `collection-folder` element contains a series of `keyword-collection` elements or `smart-collection` elements, and can also include other `collection-folder` elements. The following example represents a collection folder that contains a keyword collection and a smart collection:

```swift
<collection-folder name="MyCollection">
   <keyword-collection name="MyKeyword" />
   <smart-collection name="Compound Clips" match="all">
      <match-clip rule="is" type="compound" />
   </smart-collection>
</collection-folder>

```
