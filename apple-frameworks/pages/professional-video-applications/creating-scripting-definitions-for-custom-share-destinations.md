# Creating Scripting Definitions for Custom Share Destinations

**Interface languages:** Swift, Objective-C

**Framework:** Professional Video Applications  
**Kind:** Article

Define the record types, object classes, and event types that let your app interact with Final Cut Pro.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

As the target application of a Final Cut Pro custom share destination, your app must respond to the Apple events that Final Cut Pro sends to get information about the kind of data your users want. (See [Responding to Apple Events from Final Cut Pro](responding-to-apple-events-from-final-cut-pro.md).) Your app must also supply *scripting definitions* to define the Apple events along with their associated objects and record types. The tables in the following sections describe the definitions your app needs for its interactions with Final Cut Pro.

> **Note**

>  For an example of a complete scripting definition, see [Review a Scripting Definition Example: Asset Management Suite](creating-scripting-definitions-for-custom-share-destinations.md#Review-a-Scripting-Definition-Example-Asset-Management-Suite).

<a id="Define-Record-Types"></a>

### Define Record Types

`asset location—`Describes the location of the files associated with an object of a class asset. (See [Define Object Classes](creating-scripting-definitions-for-custom-share-destinations.md#Define-Object-Classes).)

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `folder` | `file` | The containing folder path. |
| `base name` | `text` | The base name for the exported output files. This name must match the asset name. |
| `has description` | `boolean` | Set to `true` if the app requires FCPXML as the exported output. |
| `has media` | `boolean` | Set to `true` if the app requires media as the exported output. |

`library location—`Describes the location of the library files associated with an asset.

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `library folder` | `file` | The containing folder path. |
| `library base name` | `text` | The base name for the exported output files. |
| `has archive` | `boolean` | Set to `true` if the application requires a library archive as the exported output. |
| `has library description` | `boolean` | Set to `true` if the application requires FCPXML as the exported output. |

<a id="Define-Object-Classes"></a>

### Define Object Classes

`asset—`Represents an asset object that corresponds to the exported output from Final Cut Pro.

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `text` | The unique asset identifier. |
| `name` | `text` | The asset name. |
| `location info` | `asset location` | The location of files associated with the asset. |
| `library info` | `library location` | The location of the library files associated with the asset. |
| `metadata` | `user defined record` | The shared metadata set associated with the asset. |
| `data options` | `user defined record` | The options set for the asset data. |

The protocol between Final Cut Pro and your app through Apple events should be agnostic to your app’s object containment hierarchy. For example, the scripting definition in the Asset Management Suite Example defines an asset as a document element, but it could also define an asset as an element of a larger entity, such as a media asset database.

Your app needs only to return an object specifier with which Final Cut Pro can access a specific asset object. (See [Review a Scripting Definition Example: Asset Management Suite](creating-scripting-definitions-for-custom-share-destinations.md#Review-a-Scripting-Definition-Example-Asset-Management-Suite).)

When an asset object is not a document, handling an `Open` `Document` Apple event to associate files to an asset might be a bit awkward. Because Cocoa Scripting handles the `Open` `Document` Apple event, you need a custom document controller to override the behavior of Cocoa when your app opens a file and when it associates a file (based on matching the URL) with either an existing asset object or with a new asset object. You may need some customization to ensure that the files handled through the `Open` `Document` Apple event are properly associated to the asset object.

<a id="Define-Event-Types"></a>

### Define Event Types

`make—`Creates a new asset object.

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `new` | `type` | The new object’s class. |
| `at` | `location specifier` | The location in which to insert the new object.\* |
| `with data` | `any` | The initial contents of the object.\* |
| `with` `properties` | `record` | A list of object properties used to initialize the new object: ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.professionalvideoapplications/spacer.png) `name` (`text`)—The asset name. ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.professionalvideoapplications/spacer.png) `metadata` (`record`)—The metadata set associated with the asset object. ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.professionalvideoapplications/spacer.png) `data` `options` (`record`)—The option set used to create the asset data. |

> **Note**

> Final Cut Pro doesn’t use the `at` and `with data` parameters itself, but they are inherited from the respective event definitions (or `make` event definitions) in the standard suite. They’re included here in case your app needs to support these parameters for other clients.

<a id="Specify-an-Access-Group-for-Your-App"></a>

### Specify an Access Group for Your App

To enable access from a sandboxed application to the objects and events in your app, your app must specify `com.apple.assetmanagement.import` as the access group for:

- The object class for media assets
- The respective element in its container
- The `Create Asset` event

The [Cocoa Scripting Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ScriptableCocoaApplications/SApps_intro/SAppsIntro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002164) describes how to use classes and categories to create scriptable apps (referred to as Cocoa scripting) in the Cocoa application framework.

### Review a Scripting Definition Example: Asset Management Suite

An app that interacts with Final Cut Pro must support the events and object classes described in the previous tables. The following code shows a complete example of a scripting definition used by an asset-management app.
