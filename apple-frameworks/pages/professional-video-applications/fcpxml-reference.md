# FCPXML Reference

**Interface languages:** Swift, Objective-C

**Framework:** Professional Video Applications

Create documents that describe the data your app or workflow extension exchanges with Final Cut Pro.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Use FCPXML to describe the media, metadata, and other items users send and receive between your app and Final Cut Pro.

FCPXML uses a basic XML document structure and specially defined elements, to describe the media assets, projects, and metadata users send to Final Cut Pro, and the rendered media, timeline sequences, editing decisions, and other data your app receives from Final Cut Pro.

This reference guide provides information about using FCPXML, including:

- Document structure
- Elements
- Resources

> **Note**

>  FCPXML 1.9 requires Final Cut Pro 10.4.9 or later. It describes certain, but not all, aspects of projects and events useful for other applications. But, it’s not a substitute for a native Final Cut Pro project and event data organized in a library bundle.

The following resources are helpful as you work with the FCPXML format:

- [Final Cut Pro User Guide](https://support.apple.com/guide/final-cut-pro/welcome/mac)
- [Final Cut Pro Resources](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/resources/)
- [Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0](https://www.xml.com/axml/testaxml.htm) specification
