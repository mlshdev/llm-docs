## Overview

Use a `ref-clip` element to describe a timeline sequence created from a [Compound Clip Media](compound-clip-media.md). The edit uses the entire set of media components in the compound clip media. Specify the timing of the edit through the [Timing Attributes](timing-attributes.md).

You can also use a `ref-clip` element as an immediate child element of an `event` element to represent a browser clip. In this case, use the [Timeline Attributes](timeline-attributes.md) to specify its format and other attributes.
