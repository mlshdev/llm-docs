## Overview

Use an `asset-clip` element as a shorthand for a `clip` when it references the entire set of media components in a single media.

Specify the timing of the edit through the [Timing Attributes](timing-attributes.md). The `start` and `duration` attributes of the `asset-clip` element apply to all media components in the asset.

Use the `audio-role` and `video-role` attributes to specify the main role. Generate subroles using the main role name, followed by a numerical suffix. For example, `dialogue.dialogue-1`, `dialogue.dialogue-2`, and so on.

Just as you do with the `clip` element, you can also use a `asset-clip` element as an immediate child element of an `event` element to represent a browser clip. In this case, use the [Timeline Attributes](timeline-attributes.md) to specify its format, etc.

> **Note**

>  FCPXML 1.6 added the `asset-clip` element to add both the audio and video media components from a media file as a clip.
