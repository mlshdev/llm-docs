## Overview

Apply audio filters to elements that represent audible media, for example, `audio`, `clip`, `ref-clip`, `audio-source`, and `audio-aux-source` elements. For multicam clips, apply the audio filters to the entire multicam clip, represented by `mc-clip` elements.

> **Note**

>  In FCPXML 1.3 and later, the `filter-audio` and `filter-video` elements represent audio or video filters respectively. In versions earlier than FCPXML 1.3, a single `filter` element represented both audio and video filters.
