## Overview

Transition effect applies to elements contained in a `spine` or `mc-angle`. Use the `offset` and `duration` attributes to define the position and extent of the transition effect. The [filter-video](filter-video.md) and [filter-audio](filter-audio.md) elements specify the effect to apply. 

> **Note**

>  When an audio filter specifies an audio cross fade, the cross fade doesn’t take effect on either side when the clip has audio-specific timing set by the `audioStart` or `audioDuration` attributes. This is known as a J- or L-cut, depending on the side of the transition on which it it occurs.
