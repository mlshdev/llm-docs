## Overview

When a user shares data from Final Cut Pro with your app, Final Cut Pro exports the required files and packages them together in a bundle. The bundle format makes it easy for an app to keep FCPXML and referenced files together. FCPXML Bundles have a `.fcpxmld` extension.

The simplest FCPXML bundle contains an `Info.fcpxml` file at the root level of the bundle. This file contains a structured description of the exported data. You use the file to retrieve information about the exported data and locate other relevant files in the bundle. The format of the `Info.fcpxml` file is defined in the [Document Type Definition](document-type-definition.md) (DTD).

If your app already supports `.fcpxml` files, add support for the new bundle format to ensure full compatibility with exports from Final Cut Pro.

> **Note**

>  FCPXML bundle support is available for Document Type Definition (DTD) 1.10 and later.
