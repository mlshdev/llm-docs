## Overview

The root element in an FCPXML document is `fcpxml`, which can contain the following elements:

- A `resources` element, that contains descriptions of media assets and other resources.
- An optional `import-options` element, that controls how Final Cut Pro imports the FCPXML document.
- One of the following optional elements that describe how to organize and use media assets:  a `library` element that contains a list of `event` elements; a series of `event` elements that contain story elements and `project` elements; or a combination of story elements and `<project>` elements.

> **Note**

>  Starting in FCPXML 1.9, the elements that describe how to organize and use media assets are optional. The only required element in the `fcpxml` root element is the `resources` element.
