## Overview

In Final Cut Pro, users can track the shape-mask of a video effect such as a blur, highlight, or color effect to a moving object in a video clip.

Use the `tracking-shape` element to define the shape that the [object-tracker](object-tracker.md) element uses to match the movement of a moving object in a video clip. Each object-tracker element consists of one or more tracking shapes.
