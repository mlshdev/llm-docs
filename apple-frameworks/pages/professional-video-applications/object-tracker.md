<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Users can track moving objects in video clips to match their movement to a clip, title, logo, generator, or a still image, by using the object-tracker feature in Final Cut Pro. They can also track the shape mask of a video effect, for example a blur, highlight, or color effect, to a moving object in a video clip.

The object-tracking feature records the movement of an object, for example a reference point, person, or animal, in a video clip and then applies that recorded movement data to another item, which might be a video effect, title, generator, or another video or still-image clip. The result is an animation in which the item *follows* or moves in conjunction with, the tracked object in the original clip. For example, using the object-tracking technique users can:

- Add a blurry circle to a person’s face to help preserve anonymity
- Add a glow effect to the image of jet engines on an airplane streaking through the sky
- Add the names of swimmers to their moving bodies as they compete in a swim meet

Each object-tracker element consists of one or more tracking shapes. Describe the tracking shapes by using the [tracking-shape](tracking-shape.md) element.
