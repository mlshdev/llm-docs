## Overview

A bookmark is associated with a `media-rep` element. Bookmark data is required for sandboxed applications that need to access a media file outside the sandboxed environment. Because of this requirement, Final Cut Pro creates a document-scoped bookmark for the media file for each media representation to which the user grants access and includes this bookmark data in the `media-rep` element when exporting an FCPXML document. When your application exports an FCPXML document, it’s recommended that you add bookmark data to each `media-rep` element.

For information on security-scoped bookmark, see the *Security-Scoped Bookmarks and Persistent Resource Access* section in the [App Sandbox Design Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/AppSandboxDesignGuide/AboutAppSandbox/AboutAppSandbox.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011183).

> **Note**

>  In FCPXML 1.8 or earlier, the `bookmark` element appears as a child of the `asset` element, and the bookmark data is for the asset’s original media file.
