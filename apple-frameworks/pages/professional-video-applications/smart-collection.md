### Rule Attribute

Most smart collection match elements have a `rule` attribute to describe the criteria of the filter that the element describes.

For example, the following `match-clip` element defines a filter that gathers multicam clips:

```swift
<match-clip type="multicam" rule="is"/>
```

The following `match-property` element defines a filter that gathers clips with their camera name set:

```swift
<match-property type="cameraName" rule="isSet"/>
```

The possible values for the `rule` attribute are listed below. Depending on the smart collection match element, the possible values may be different. Consult the FCPXML Document Type Definition for the exact details.

| Attribute | Possible Values |
| --- | --- |
| `rule` | `includes` ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.professionalvideoapplications/spacer.png) `doesNotInclude` ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.professionalvideoapplications/spacer.png) |
| `includesAny` ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.professionalvideoapplications/spacer.png) |  |
| `includesAll` ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.professionalvideoapplications/spacer.png) |  |
| `doesNotIncludeAny` ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.professionalvideoapplications/spacer.png) |  |
| `doesNotIncludeAll` ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.professionalvideoapplications/spacer.png) |  |
| `is` ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.professionalvideoapplications/spacer.png) |  |
| `isNot` ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.professionalvideoapplications/spacer.png) |  |
| `isSet` ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.professionalvideoapplications/spacer.png) |  |
| `isNotSet` ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.professionalvideoapplications/spacer.png) |  |
| `isBefore` ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.professionalvideoapplications/spacer.png) |  |
| `isAfter` ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.professionalvideoapplications/spacer.png) |  |
| `isInLast` ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.professionalvideoapplications/spacer.png) |  |
| `isNotInLast` ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.professionalvideoapplications/spacer.png) |  |
| `used` ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.professionalvideoapplications/spacer.png) |  |
| `unused` |  |

The following example shows three smart collections. The first one collects video clips, either video only or video and audio. The second one collects audio-only clips. The third one is for still-image clips.

```swift
<smart-collection name="Video" match="any">
    <match-media rule="is" type="videoOnly"/>
    <match-media rule="is" type="videoWithAudio"/>
</smart-collection>
<smart-collection name="Audio Only" match="all">
    <match-media rule="is" type="audioOnly"/>
</smart-collection>
<smart-collection name="Stills" match="all">
    <match-media rule="is" type="stills"/>
</smart-collection>
```
