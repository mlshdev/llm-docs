# Scheduling media in plug-ins (Swift)

**Framework:** Professional Video Applications  
**Kind:** Article

Use the scheduling APIs in FxPlug to retrieve frames from different times.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

The FxPlug SDK provides several timing and scheduling methods that give plug-ins a way to get the current time and to schedule media.

<a id="Get-the-current-time"></a>

### Get the current time

When an onscreen control or an event in a custom parameter view requires the current time, use the [currentTime()](../professional_video_applications/fxcustomparameteractionapi_v4/currenttime%28%29.md) method in the `FxCustomParameterAPI` protocol to get the rational time.

> **Important**

>  All FxPlug 4 APIs represent time using [CMTime](../coremedia/cmtime.md). If you’re familiar with previous versions of FxPlug, note the move away from `FxTime`. For more information, see [CMTime](../coremedia/cmtime.md).

### Schedule media

The scheduling API lets the host applications schedule the media contained in image wells. Consider this method, new to FxPlug 4:

**Swift**

```swift
optional func scheduleInputs(_ inputImageRequests: AutoreleasingUnsafeMutablePointer<NSArray?>?, withPluginState pluginState: Data?, at renderTime: CMTime) throws
```

**Objective-C**

```objc
- (BOOL)scheduleInputs:(NSArray<FxImageTileRequest*>* _Nullable *_Nullable)inputImageRequests
       withPluginState:(NSData* _Nullable)pluginState
                atTime:(CMTime)renderTime
                 error:(NSError**)error;
```

This method tells the host application how many frames from the given input sources your plug-in will require in order to render at the given render time. See `PictureInPicturePlugIn.m` in the `FxPictureInPicture` project for an example of how [scheduleInputs(\_:withPluginState:at:)](../professional_video_applications/fxtileableeffect/scheduleinputs%28__withpluginstate_at_%29.md) can be used with an image well.
