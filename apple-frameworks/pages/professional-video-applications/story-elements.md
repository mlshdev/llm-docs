# Story Elements

**Interface languages:** Swift, Objective-C

**Framework:** Professional Video Applications

Describe Final Cut Pro events and project data and their associated effects.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Use Story Elements to arrange video or audio materials and titles or generators into a timeline, in the order you want them to appear when it plays on the timeline. Use the [Timing Attributes](timing-attributes.md) for additional control over their precise timing.

Anchor one or more other story elements to each story element. An anchored item has a positive or negative lane index that either positions the item above or below its base element in the timeline.

For video elements, lane order also implies compositing order — items with higher lane indexes composite over elements with lower lane indexes. For audio elements, lane order doesn’t affect compositing. Items that reside inside, rather than above or below, a container are called contained items and have an implied lane index of zero.

Many story elements can contain annotations (keyword, markers, and so on) over a range of time, specified with the start and duration attributes. Add annotations  to story elements using the elements listed under Annotation and Note Elements.

## Topics

### Story Elements

- [clip](clip.md): Represents a basic unit of editing.
- [asset-clip](asset-clip.md): References a single media asset.
- [sync-clip](sync-clip.md): Contains a clip with its contained and anchored items synchronized.
- [audio](audio.md): References audio data from an `asset` or `effect` element.
- [video](video.md): References video data from an `asset` or `effect` element.
- [mc-clip](mc-clip.md): References a multicam media.
- [ref-clip](ref-clip.md): References a compound clip media.
- [gap](gap.md): Defines a placeholder element that has no intrinsic audio or video data.
- [spine](spine.md): Contains elements ordered sequentially in time.
- [audition](audition.md): Contains one active story element followed by alternative story elements in the audition container.
- [sequence](sequence.md): A container that represents the top-level sequence for a Final Cut Pro project or compound clip.

### Timeline Characteristics

- [Timeline Attributes](timeline-attributes.md): Define characteristics of a timeline.
- [Timing Attributes](timing-attributes.md): Schedule the element and its contained or anchored items in a timeline.
- [timeMap](timemap.md): Adjust or retime the playback speed of an element.
- [conform-rate](conform-rate.md): Apply rate conforming to match media frame rate to timeline frame rate.
- [Frame Sampling](frame-sampling.md): Adjust the clip’s frame rate to match the project’s frame rate.

### Adjustment and Effects Elements

- [Adjustment Elements](adjustment-elements.md): Alter the audio and video output of story elements by using adjustment elements.
- [transition](transition.md): Applies transition effects that either stand by itself (no neighboring elements), combine two neighboring elements, or apply to a single element.
- [title](title.md): Represents a title with one or more text blocks.
- [caption](caption.md): Represents a closed-caption or subtitle with one or more text blocks.
- [filter-audio](filter-audio.md): A filter element that references an audio effect.
- [filter-video](filter-video.md): A filter element that references a video effect.
- [Masked Filters](masked-filters.md): Designate a region to which you apply video filter by using a collection of masks.
- [Adjustment Attributes and Effect Parameters](adjustment-attributes-and-effect-parameters.md): Specify values to change adjustment attributes and effects parameters.
- [Animation](animation.md): Create animations by changing specific adjustment attributes and effect parameters over time.

### Audio Component Configuration

- [audio-channel-source](audio-channel-source.md): Defines an audio component by its source channels.
- [audio-role-source](audio-role-source.md): Defines an audio component by its role.
- [mute](mute.md): Suppresses audio output for the audio component over a range of time.

### Annotation and Note Elements

- [keyword](keyword.md): An annotation that applies a keyword to a range of time.
- [marker](marker.md): An annotation, with an optional to-do flag, that applies a text marker to a range of time.
- [chapter-marker](chapter-marker.md): An annotation that applies to a range of time and indicates a chapter.
- [analysis-marker](analysis-marker.md): An annotation that indicates the result of scene analysis to determine the number of people present and the shot and stabilization types.
- [rating](rating.md): A rating annotation, such as favorite or reject, that applies to a range of time.
- [note](note.md): Define descriptive notes that appliy to an entire element.

### Media Component Roles

- [Roles Attribute](roles-attribute.md): Assign video, audio, title, and caption elements a role.
