## Overview

Use a `clip` element to describe a timeline sequence created from a source media file. A `clip` contains `video` and/or `audio` elements, each of which represents a media component (usually a track) in media. Specify the timing of the edit through the [Timing Attributes](timing-attributes.md).

You can also use a `clip` element as an immediate child element of an `event` element to represent a browser clip. In this case, use the [Timeline Attributes](timeline-attributes.md) to specify its format, and so on.
