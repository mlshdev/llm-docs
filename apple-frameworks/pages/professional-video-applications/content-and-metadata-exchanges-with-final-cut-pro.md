## Overview

Help your users exchange data between Final Cut Pro and your app, and avoid unwieldy manual processes. With FCPXML representing media, metadata, and Final Cut Pro items, your users can send data from your app to Final Cut Pro for editing, or receive rendered media (movies) and editing decisions from Final Cut Pro projects in your app for further processing.

FCPXML is a specialized format that uses XML elements to describe the data going between your app and Final Cut Pro. With FCPXML simplifying the data exchange, app users can:

- Send large quantities of media from an asset management tool to be edited in Final Cut Pro.
- Send media clips—annotated with ratings, keywords, and metadata—and let Final Cut Pro organize the incoming media.
- Receive rendered media and editing decisions for a project—including lists of media used—from Final Cut Pro for further processing, such as color grading and correction.
- Receive rendered media (movies) in an app to finish and package for delivery, playout, or archiving.
- Record an audio/video stream and start editing the media in Final Cut Pro while the file is still being recorded.
