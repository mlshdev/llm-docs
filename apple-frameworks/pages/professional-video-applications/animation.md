# Animation

**Interface languages:** Swift, Objective-C

**Framework:** Professional Video Applications

Create animations by changing specific adjustment attributes and effect parameters over time.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

You can create animations with a [Parameter Element](adjustment-attributes-and-effect-parameters.md#Parameter-Element) for the attribute or parameter to animate, along with a [keyframeAnimation](keyframeanimation.md) element that has a series of `keyframe` elements, each of which defines a value at a point in time.

To produce a keyframe animation, specify the time points and values for each keyframe using the time and value attributes of the `keyframe` element. The Final Cut Pro application interpolates the values between them.

The following example performs a position and scale transform adjustment animation using keyframes:

```swift
<adjust-transform position="-10 10">
   <param name="position">
      <keyframeAnimation>
         <keyframe time="0s" value="-5 10" />
         <keyframe time="10s" value="10 20" />
      </keyframeAnimation>
   </param>
   <param name="scale">
      <keyframeAnimation>
         <keyframe time="0s" value="1 1" />
         <keyframe time="10s" value="0.75 0.75" />
      </keyframeAnimation>
   </param>
</adjust-transform>
```

Initially, when time is equal to  0 seconds (time=0s), the frame is moved left 5 percent and up 10 percent `(“-5 10”)` of the project’s height from the original location, with no change in size `(“1 1”)`. When time is equal to 10 seconds (time=10s), the frame has moved 10 percent right and 20 percent up `(“10 20”)` of the project’s height from the original location, with a 25 percent `(“0.75 0.75”)` reduction in size from the original `(“1 1”)`. For more information on the `adjust-transform` element, see [Video Adjustment Elements](adjustment-elements.md#Video-Adjustment-Elements).

Final Cut Pro determines the parameter value based on the following priority (with 1 being the highest priority):

- The `value` and `time` attributes of the `keyframe` element, for a particular time
- The `value` attribute of the `param` element
- The respective attribute of the adjustment, if applicable

In the previous example, it doesn’t matter that the `position` attribute of the `adjust-transform` element has a value of “`-10 10`”,  because the keyframe defined at when time is equal to 0s (`time=0s)` (in the `keyframe` element) takes priority and overrides the value to “`-5 10`”.
