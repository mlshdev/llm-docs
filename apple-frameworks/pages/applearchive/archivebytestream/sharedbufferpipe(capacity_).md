# sharedBufferPipe(capacity:)

**Framework:** Apple Archive  
**Kind:** Type Method  
**Availability:** iOS 14.0+ · iPadOS 14.0+ · Mac Catalyst 14.0+ · macOS 11.0+ · tvOS 14.0+ · visionOS · watchOS 7.0+

Creates a pair of streams and links them by a shared buffer.

## Declaration

```swift
static func sharedBufferPipe(capacity: Int) -> (output: ArchiveByteStream, input: ArchiveByteStream)?
```

## Parameters

- `capacity`: The size of the internal buffer allocation, in bytes.

## Return Value

A new pair of [ArchiveByteStream](../archivebytestream.md) instances on success; `nil` otherwise.

## Discussion

This function creates two [ArchiveByteStream](../archivebytestream.md) instances that provide one-way communication between two threads. One thread calls the sequential output stream `output`, and the other thread calls the sequential input stream `input`. The function blocks writing to `output` when the buffer is full, and blocks reading from `input` when the buffer is empty.

If either thread calls [cancel](../archiveheader/entrymessagestatus/cancel.md), the operation aborts both streams, and immediately calls return (without blocking) with an error.

Closing `output`, indicates end-of-file (EOF) and writing additional bytes fails. After the operation reaches EOF and has read all data, the read function on `input` returns `0` to signal EOF.

The operation destroys the underlying buffer after it closes both streams.
