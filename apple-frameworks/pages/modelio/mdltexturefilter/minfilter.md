# minFilter (Swift)

**Framework:** Model I/O  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 9.0+ · iPadOS 9.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.11+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

The filter mode for rendering textures at sizes smaller than that of the original image.

## Declaration

```swift
var minFilter: MDLMaterialTextureFilterMode { get set }
```

## Discussion

Texture filtering determines the appearance of a rendered surface when portions of the surface appear larger or smaller than the original texture image. For example, the texture coordinates at a point far from the camera may correspond to an area of several texels. A renderer uses the minification filter to determine the color of the sampled texel at that point.

The default value is [MDLMaterialTextureFilterMode.linear](../mdlmaterialtexturefiltermode/linear.md), indicating that a renderer should linearly interpolate between texels.
