# color1 (Swift)

**Framework:** Model I/O  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 9.0+ · iPadOS 9.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.11+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

The color for half of the squares in the checkerboard pattern.

## Declaration

```swift
var color1: CGColor? { get set }
```

## Discussion

This color appears in the top left square of the generated pattern, and in alternate squares thereafter.

Changing the [divisions](divisions.md), [color1](color1.md), or [color2](color2.md) properties invalidates the cache, causing Model I/O to regenerate texel data the next time it is needed.

### Configuring the Checkerboard Pattern

- [color2](color2.md): The color for the other half of the squares in the checkerboard pattern.
- [divisions](divisions.md): The number of squares along each dimension in the checkerboard pattern.
