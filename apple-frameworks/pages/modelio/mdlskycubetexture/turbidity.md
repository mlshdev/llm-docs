# turbidity (Swift)

**Framework:** Model I/O  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 9.0+ · iPadOS 9.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.11+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

The cloudiness or haziness of the simulated sky.

## Declaration

```swift
var turbidity: Float { get set }
```

## Discussion

A value of `0.0` simulates a clear sky—that is, the sun has little effect on the color of the sky around it. Values closer to `1.0` simulate increasing amounts of dust and moisture in the sky, causing the sun’s color to spread across the atmosphere.

### Working with Sky Simulation Parameters

- [sunElevation](sunelevation.md): The sun’s position in the simulated sky.
- [upperAtmosphereScattering](upperatmospherescattering.md): A factor that influences the color of the simulated sky.
- [groundAlbedo](groundalbedo.md): A factor that influences the clarity of the simulated sky.
- [groundColor](groundcolor.md): The color of the simulated ground.
- [horizonElevation](horizonelevation.md): The angle, in radians relative to center, below which to render the ground color.
