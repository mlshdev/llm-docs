# scatteringFunction (Swift)

**Framework:** Model I/O  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 9.0+ · iPadOS 9.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.11+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

The collection of material properties that define the material’s response to light.

## Declaration

```swift
var scatteringFunction: MDLScatteringFunction { get }
```

## Discussion

A [MDLScatteringFunction](../mdlscatteringfunction.md) object defines a Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF), which determines how a material interacts with lighting to produce a surface appearance. Though you can access the individual material properties in a scattering function directly, a scattering function object lets you work with the collection of lighting-related material properties as a single unit. Use the [MDLScatteringFunction](../mdlscatteringfunction.md) class itself to describe a classical Lambertian/Blinn-Phong shading model, or the [MDLPhysicallyPlausibleScatteringFunction](../mdlphysicallyplausiblescatteringfunction.md) class to describe a shading model based more closely on real-world physics.

A scattering function determines lighting-related aspects of a material’s appearance, but not all aspects. For features such as opacity and surface deformation, use the methods listed in Working with individual material properties to access the corresponding material properties.
