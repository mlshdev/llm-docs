# MDLMaterialSemantic.anisotropicRotation (Swift)

**Framework:** Model I/O  
**Kind:** Case  
**Availability:** iOS 9.0+ · iPadOS 9.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.11+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

The angle at which anisotropic effects are rotated relative to the local tangent basis.

## Declaration

```swift
case anisotropicRotation
```

## Discussion

Values for this semantic in the range from `0.0` to `1.0` map to angles from `0.0` to `2 * M_PI`. This semantic has no effect in a mesh that does not contain vertex attribute data providing a tangent basis.

Model I/O uses this semantic for the `anisotropicRotation` and `map_anisotropicRotation` attributes when importing from the MTL file format (for assets in the OBJ file format).

### Constants

- [MDLMaterialSemantic.baseColor](basecolor.md): The inherent color of a surface, to be used as a modulator during shading.
- [MDLMaterialSemantic.subsurface](subsurface.md): The degree to which light scatters under the surface of a material.
- [MDLMaterialSemantic.metallic](metallic.md): The degree to which a material appears as a dielectric surface (lower values) or as a metal (higher values).
- [MDLMaterialSemantic.specular](specular.md): The intensity of specular highlights that appear on the material’s surface.
- [MDLMaterialSemantic.specularExponent](specularexponent.md): The exponent to be used in Blinn-Phong approximation of the material’s specular response.
- [MDLMaterialSemantic.specularTint](speculartint.md): The balance of color for specular highlights, between the light color (lower values) and the material’s base color (at higher values).
- [MDLMaterialSemantic.roughness](roughness.md): The degree to which a material appears smooth, affecting both diffuse and specular response.
- [MDLMaterialSemantic.anisotropic](anisotropic.md): The degree to which specular highlights elongate in the direction of the local tangent basis.
- [MDLMaterialSemantic.sheen](sheen.md): The intensity of highlights that appear only at glancing angles on a material’s surface.
- [MDLMaterialSemantic.sheenTint](sheentint.md): The balance of color for highlights that appear only at glancing angles, between the light color (lower values) and the material’s base color (at higher values).
- [MDLMaterialSemantic.clearcoat](clearcoat.md): The intensity of a second specular highlight, similar to the gloss that results from a clear coat on an automotive finish.
- [MDLMaterialSemantic.clearcoatGloss](clearcoatgloss.md): The spread of a second specular highlight, similar to the gloss that results from a clear coat on an automotive finish.
- [MDLMaterialSemantic.emission](emission.md): The color emitted as radiance from a material’s surface.
- [MDLMaterialSemantic.bump](bump.md): The degree of perturbation in a material’s surface.
- [MDLMaterialSemantic.opacity](opacity.md): The opacity of a material’s surface.
