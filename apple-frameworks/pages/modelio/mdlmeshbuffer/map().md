# map() (Swift)

**Framework:** Model I/O  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 9.0+ · iPadOS 9.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.11+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

Provides direct, read-only access to the buffer’s contents.

## Declaration

```swift
func map() -> MDLMeshBufferMap
```

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

A data object mapped to the storage memory for the buffer.

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

The buffer’s storage remains mapped for as long as the returned [MDLMeshBufferMap](../mdlmeshbuffermap.md) object exists, potentially restricting other uses of that storage. For example, if a buffer’s storage is shared with GPU memory, that buffer may be unavailable for use in rendering until the [MDLMeshBufferMap](../mdlmeshbuffermap.md) object is deallocated.

### Working with Data in a Buffer

- [fill(\_:offset:)](fill%28__offset_%29.md): Writes the specified data into the buffer.
- [length](length.md): The data size of the buffer, in bytes.
