# layouts (Swift)

**Framework:** Model I/O  
**Kind:** Instance Property

The list of vertex buffer layouts described by the vertex descriptor.

## Declaration

var layouts: NSMutableArray { get set }
```

## Discussion

A [MDLVertexBufferLayout](../mdlvertexbufferlayout.md) object describes the layout of data in one of the vertex buffers of a of a [MDLMesh](../mdlmesh.md) object.

For meshes whose vertex data is split into multiple vertex buffers (a *structure of arrays* design), the order of objects in this array reflects the order of buffers in the mesh’s [vertexBuffers](../mdlmesh/vertexbuffers.md) array, which in turn parallels the order of vertex attributes in the descriptor’s [attributes](attributes.md) array. If a mesh contains interleaved data in a single vertex buffer (an *array of structures* design), the descriptor contains only one [MDLVertexBufferLayout](../mdlvertexbufferlayout.md) object, which describes the offset between entries for consecutive vertices in the buffer.
