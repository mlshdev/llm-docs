Data containing the spherical harmonics coefficients for the light.

## Declaration

```swift
var sphericalHarmonicsCoefficients: Data? { get }
```

## Discussion

Spherical harmonic coefficients describe the distribution of light around a light source with less high-frequency detail than a cube map texture, but they can be used more efficiently in real-time rendering. Use the [generateSphericalHarmonics(fromIrradiance:)](generatesphericalharmonics%28fromirradiance_%29.md) method to create spherical harmonics data based on the light probe’s irradiance texture.

The data is an array of 32-bit floating-point values, containing three noninterleaved data sets corresponding to the red, green, and blue sets of coefficients. The array’s length is determined by the [sphericalHarmonicsLevel](sphericalharmonicslevel.md) property:

- At level 0, the array has 1 coefficient (3 values).
- At level 1, the array has 4 coefficients (3 sets of 4 values, 12 values total).
- At level 2, the array has 9 coefficients (3 sets of 9 values, 27 values total).
- At level 3, the array has 16 coefficients (3 sets of 16 values, 48 values total).
- Spherical harmonics levels beyond 3 are not supported.

For example, the code below shows how to access the second coefficient at level 2.

**Swift**

```swift
func numberOfCoefficients(at level: Int) -> Int {
    return (level + 1) * (level + 1)
}
func offsetForLevel(_ level: Int) -> Int {
    return numberOfCoefficients(at: level - 1) - 1
}
guard let coeffs = light.sphericalHarmonicsCoefficients
    else { fatalError("light does not have spherical harmonics") }
let totalCount = numberOfCoefficients(at: light.sphericalHarmonicsLevel)
let offset = offsetForLevel(2) // level 2 has three sets of coefficients, at indexes 3...5
let index = 1 // get the second of 3 coefficients on level 2 (zero-based index)
coeffs.withUnsafeBytes { (bytes: UnsafePointer<Float>) -> () in
    let red = bytes[offset + index]
    let green = bytes[totalCount + offset + index]
    let blue = bytes[totalCount * 2 + offset + index]
}
```

**Objective-C**

```objc
float numberOfCoefficients(int level) {
    return (level + 1) * (level + 1)
}
float offsetForLevel(int level) {
    return numberOfCoefficients(level - 1) - 1
}
float *coeffs = (float *)lightProbe.sphericalHarmonicsCoefficients.bytes;
int totalCount = numberOfCoefficients(lightProbe.sphericalHarmonicsLevel);
int offset = offsetForLevel(2); // level 2 has 3 sets of coefficients, at indexes 3, 4, and 5
int index = 1; // get the second of 3 coefficients on level 2 (zero-based index)
float red = coeffs[offset + index];
float green = coeffs[totalCount + offset + index];
float blue = coeffs[totalCount * 2 + offset + index];
```

Spherical harmonic coefficients describe the distribution of light around a light source with less high-frequency detail than a cube map texture, but they can be used more efficiently in real-time rendering.
