## Overview

*Passes* are digital representations of information that previously might have been distributed on paper, plastic, or some other physical item. Passes enable people to take action, including board a flight, attend an event, or redeem a coupon. Use the Wallet Passes framework to create dynamic, interactive passes that stay up-to-date and provide people with relevant information.

One pass is an annual pass for an art museum, the center pass shows an event pass for a soccer event, and the pass on the right is an airline boarding pass for a flight.](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.walletpasses/wallet-passes-overview@2x.png)

With this framework you can:

- Create boarding passes, event tickets, store cards, coupons, and generic passes.
- Update the pass contents in real-time.
- Display multiple upcoming events on a single ticket.
- Integrate with system features like Maps, notifications, and Live Activities.
- Support automatic pass updates with flight tracking for boarding passes.

To enable a person to install your pass, you’ll:

- Create the source for a pass.
- Build a distributable pass from the source.
- Distribute a pass.

You can further tailor passes for a personalized experience and make live updates to different kinds of passes through your server.
