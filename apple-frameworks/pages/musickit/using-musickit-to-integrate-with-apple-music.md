### Configure the sample code project

This sample code project must be run on a physical device.

Before you run the sample code project in Xcode, perform the following steps:

1. In the Project navigator, select the project and click the *Signing & Capabilities* tab.
2. Select your developer team from the *Team* menu.
3. Choose a new bundle identifier for the `MusicAlbums` target, and enter it in the Bundle Identifier field. The bundle identifier within the project has an associated App ID, so you need a unique identifier to create your own App ID. Use a reverse-DNS format for your identifier, as [Preparing Your App For Distribution](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/preparing-your-app-for-distribution) describes.
4. In Safari, visit the [Certificates, Identifiers, and Profiles](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources) section of the developer web site.
5. Select *Identifiers* and click the Add button to create a new App ID for `MusicAlbums`. Follow the steps until you reach the *Register an App ID* page.
6. For the Bundle ID, select *Explicit*, and enter the bundle identifier from step 2.
7. Click the *App Services* tab, and select the MusicKit checkbox.
8. Complete the App ID creation process.

After creating your App ID, your Xcode project needs no additional configuration. The MusicKit App Service is a run-time service that automatically associates with your app’s bundle ID.
