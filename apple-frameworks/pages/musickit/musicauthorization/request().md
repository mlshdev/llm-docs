## Discussion

Before using any other MusicKit API in your app, make sure the user grants your app access to their Apple Music data, You can do this either by comparing [currentStatus](currentstatus.md) to [MusicAuthorization.Status.authorized](status/authorized.md), or by simply calling [request()](request%28%29.md) regardless of the current authorization status value. Calling [request()](request%28%29.md) results in presenting a standard user consent dialog to the user when necessary.

Requesting authorization to use MusicKit requires the inclusion of a short description of the app’s reason for using MusicKit. You need to add this purpose string to the app’s `Info.plist` file using the [NSAppleMusicUsageDescription](../../bundleresources/information-property-list/nsapplemusicusagedescription.md) key.
