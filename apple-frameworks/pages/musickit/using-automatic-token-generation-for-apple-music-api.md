## Overview

MusicKit accelerates the way you integrate your app with Apple Music API by automatically generating the developer token on behalf of your app. It then includes the developer token in requests that it issues to Apple Music API for your app.

To benefit from this automatic behavior, just enable the MusicKit App Service in the developer portal for your app. The MusicKit App Service is a runtime service that automatically associates with your app’s bundle identifier.

2. In the Identifiers subsection, open the App ID for your app and begin editing its configuration, or create a new one.
3. On the Register an App ID page, select the Explicit option for the bundle ID of your app.
4. Click or tap the App Services tab, and select the Enabled checkbox for MusicKit. ![Enable MusicKit App Service](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.MusicKit/Enable-MusicKit-App-Service@2x.png)
