# CVBufferRemoveAttachment(\_:\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Video  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** iOS 4.0+ · iPadOS 4.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.4+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

Removes the attachment you specify from a Core Video buffer.

## Declaration

```swift
func CVBufferRemoveAttachment(_ buffer: CVBuffer, _ key: CFString)
```

## Parameters

- `buffer`: The buffer containing the attachment to remove.
- `key`: A string that identifies the attachment, which can be of any [CFTypeRef](../corefoundation/cftyperef.md). See [CVBuffer Attachment Keys](cvbuffer-attachment-keys.md) and [Image Buffer Attachment Keys](image-buffer-attachment-keys.md) for predefined values.
