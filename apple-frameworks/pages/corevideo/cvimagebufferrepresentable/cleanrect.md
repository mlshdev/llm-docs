# cleanRect

**Framework:** Core Video

Source rectangle of a CVImageBuffer that represents the clean aperture of the buffer in encoded pixels. For example, an NTSC DV frame would return a CGRect with an origin of 8,0 and a size of 704,480. Note that the origin of this rect is always the lower left corner. This is the same coordinate system as used by CoreImage.

## Declaration

```swift
var cleanRect: CGRect { get }
```
