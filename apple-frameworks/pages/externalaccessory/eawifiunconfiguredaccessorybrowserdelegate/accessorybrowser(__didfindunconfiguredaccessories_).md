## Discussion

When a new unconfigured accessory is found, it’s added to the browser’s set of accessories, which is available in the [unconfiguredAccessories](../eawifiunconfiguredaccessorybrowser/unconfiguredaccessories.md) property. A delegate can implement this method to present to the user the current list of unconfigured accessories. Because this method is called every time a new unconfigured accessory is found, you might use this callback as a prompt to check the list of accessories in [unconfiguredAccessories](../eawifiunconfiguredaccessorybrowser/unconfiguredaccessories.md).
