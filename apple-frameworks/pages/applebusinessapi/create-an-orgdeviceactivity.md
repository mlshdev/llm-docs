<a id="Example-Assign-Devices-to-a-Device-Management-Service-With-a-Device-Management-Service-Migration-Deadline"></a>

### Example: Assign Devices to a Device Management Service With a Device Management Service Migration Deadline

To assign devices to a device management service and schedule a device management service migration, use the `ASSIGN_DEVICES_WITH_MDM_MIGRATION_DEADLINE` activity type and include `activityTypeMetadata.mdmMigrationDeadlineDateTime`, an ISO 8601 date and time by which the migration needs to complete. The deadline can’t be more than 90 days in the future.

**Request**

```

<a id="Example-Update-a-Device-Management-Service-Migration-Deadline"></a>

### Example: Update a Device Management Service Migration Deadline

To update the deadline for an in-progress device management service migration, use the `UPDATE_MDM_MIGRATION_DEADLINE` activity type. This doesn’t require a `mdmServer` relationship. If the new deadline is earlier than the existing one, or in the past, the device honors it without giving the user an option to delay the migration.

**Request**

```
curl -X POST https://api-business.apple.com/v1/orgDeviceActivities \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN} \
 -d '{
   "data": {
     "type": "orgDeviceActivities",
     "attributes": {
       "activityType": "UPDATE_MDM_MIGRATION_DEADLINE",
       "activityTypeMetadata": {
         "mdmMigrationDeadlineDateTime": "2026-03-15T17:00:00.000Z"
       }
     },
     "relationships": {
       "devices": {
         "data": [
           {
             "type": "orgDevices",
             "id": "C39J8W1H3VG5"
           },
           {
             "type": "orgDevices",
             "id": "F2KZ3N4G5HD3"
           }
         ]
       }
     }
   }
 }'

```

**Response**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "type": "orgDeviceActivities",
    "id": "f7e6d5c4-b3a2-1098-fedc-ba9876543210",
    "attributes": {
      "status": "IN_PROGRESS",
      "subStatus": "SUBMITTED",
      "createdDateTime": "2026-02-27T18:00:00.000Z"
    },
    "links": {
      "self": "https://api-business.apple.com/v1/orgDeviceActivities/f7e6d5c4-b3a2-1098-fedc-ba9876543210"
    }
  },
  "links": {
    "self": "https://api-business.apple.com/v1/orgDeviceActivities"
  }
}
```

If the request tries to update the deadline for a serial number that isn’t undergoing a device management service migration, the activity log result indicates a failure for that serial number.

### Example: Cancel an MDM Migration

To cancel an in-progress device management service migration, use the `CANCEL_MDM_MIGRATION` activity type. This doesn’t require a `mdmServer` relationship or `activityTypeMetadata`.

**Request**

```
curl -X POST https://api-business.apple.com/v1/orgDeviceActivities \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN} \
 -d '{
   "data": {
     "type": "orgDeviceActivities",
     "attributes": {
       "activityType": "CANCEL_MDM_MIGRATION"
     },
     "relationships": {
       "devices": {
         "data": [
           {
             "type": "orgDevices",
             "id": "C39J8W1H3VG5"
           },
           {
             "type": "orgDevices",
             "id": "F2KZ3N4G5HD3"
           }
         ]
       }
     }
   }
 }'

```

**Response**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "type": "orgDeviceActivities",
    "id": "f7e6d5c4-b3a2-1098-fedc-ba9876543210",
    "attributes": {

    }
  },

  }
}
```

If the request tries to cancel a device management service migration for a serial number that isn’t undergoing one, the activity log result indicates a failure for that serial number.

<a id="Example-Release-Devices-from-an-Organization"></a>

### Example: Release Devices from an Organization

To release devices from an organization, use `RELEASE_DEVICES` activity type.

> **Important**

> Released devices will no longer be registered to the organization and device enrollment assignments are removed. Devices will be unenrolled from the built-in device management service and removed from Blueprints.
