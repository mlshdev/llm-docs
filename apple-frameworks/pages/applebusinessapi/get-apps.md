## Overview

> **Important**

> This endpoint requires the built-in device management service to be turned on for the organization. If you need to manage apps without the built-in device management, use the [Apps and Books for Organizations](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement/apps-and-books-for-organizations) API instead.
