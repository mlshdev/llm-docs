# Power Management Capabilities

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** PCIDriverKit  
**Kind:** API Collection

Constants you use to get and set the state of the device’s power management features.

## Topics

### Capabilities Registers

- [kPCIPMCPMESupportFromD0](kpcipmcpmesupportfromd0.md): The full-power state of the device, in which the device is running and fully operational.
- [kPCIPMCPMESupportFromD1](kpcipmcpmesupportfromd1.md): A low-power state of the device, in which the device is handling only configuration and message requests.
- [kPCIPMCPMESupportFromD2](kpcipmcpmesupportfromd2.md): A low-power state of the device, in which the device is not in use.
- [kPCIPMCPMESupportFromD3Hot](kpcipmcpmesupportfromd3hot.md): A low-power state of the device, in which the device is running in a limited capacity.
- [kPCIPMCPMESupportFromD3Cold](kpcipmcpmesupportfromd3cold.md): The state where the device has no power.
- [kPCIPMCD1Support](kpcipmcd1support.md): A constant that indicates the device supports the D1 state.
- [kPCIPMCD2Support](kpcipmcd2support.md): A constant that indicates the device supports the D2 state.
- [kPCIPMCD3Support](kpcipmcd3support.md): A constant that indicates the device supports the D3 state.
