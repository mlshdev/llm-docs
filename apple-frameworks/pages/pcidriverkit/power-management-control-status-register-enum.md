### Register Bits

- [kPCIPMCSPowerStateD0](kpcipmcspowerstated0.md): The device is in the D0 state.
- [kPCIPMCSPowerStateD1](kpcipmcspowerstated1.md): The device is in the D1 state.
- [kPCIPMCSPowerStateD2](kpcipmcspowerstated2.md): The device is in the D2 state.
- [kPCIPMCSPowerStateD3](kpcipmcspowerstated3.md): The device is in the D3 state.
- [kPCIPMCSPowerStateMask](kpcipmcspowerstatemask.md): A bit mask you use to determine the current power state of the device.
- [kPCIPMCSPMEEnable](kpcipmcspmeenable.md): The bit that specifies whether power management events are enabled.
- [kPCIPMCSPMEStatus](kpcipmcspmestatus.md): The bit that contains the current state of power management events.
