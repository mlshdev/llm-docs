# start() (Swift)

**Framework:** Authentication Services  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 12.0+ · iPadOS 12.0+ · Mac Catalyst 12.0+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 16.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 6.2+

Starts a web authentication session.

## Declaration

```swift
func start() -> Bool
```

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

A Boolean value indicating whether the web authentication session started successfully.

## Mentioned In

- [Authenticating a User Through a Web Service](../authenticating-a-user-through-a-web-service.md)
- [Supporting Single Sign-On in a Web Browser App](../supporting-single-sign-on-in-a-web-browser-app.md)

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

Only call this method once for a given [ASWebAuthenticationSession](../aswebauthenticationsession.md) instance after initialization. Calling the [start()](start%28%29.md) method on a canceled session results in a failure.

In macOS, and for iOS apps with a deployment target of iOS 13 or later, after you call [start()](start%28%29.md), the session instance stores a strong reference to itself. To avoid deallocation during the authentication process, the session keeps the reference until after it calls the completion handler.

For iOS apps with a deployment target earlier than iOS 13, your app must keep a strong reference to the session to prevent the system from deallocating the session while waiting for authentication to complete.
