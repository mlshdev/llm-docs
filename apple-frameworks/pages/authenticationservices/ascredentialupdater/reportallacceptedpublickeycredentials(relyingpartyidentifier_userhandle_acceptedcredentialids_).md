## Discussion

If your app allows someone to revoke a passkey or create a new one, call this method to report all credentials still accepted after the change. Credential managers can act on this report by removing or hiding any credentials not present in `acceptedCredentialIDs`, which prevents display of invalid passkeys during later sign ins.

You can also call this method periodically, such as by invoking it on every sign in. This sort of periodic check in helps keep credential managers up to date.

This call shares the updated credential data with all enabled credential managers installed on the system.

> **Throws**

> This method throws [ASAuthorizationError](../asauthorizationerror-swift.struct.md) if the system failed to accept the update.
