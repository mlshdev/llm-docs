## Overview

The `imgDeck` contains a set of `img` elements—images that are part of the related content for another element. When another element, such as `listItemLockup`, is in focus, the information in the `relatedContent` element is also displayed.

```xml
<relatedContent>
    <imgDeck>
        <img src="path to images on your server/Car_Movie_250x375.png "/>
        <img src="path to images on your server/Car_Movie_250x375_A.png "/>
        <img src="path to images on your server/Car_Movie_250x375_B.png "/>
        <img src="path to images on your server/Car_Movie_250x375_C.png "/>
    </imgDeck>
</relatedContent>
```
