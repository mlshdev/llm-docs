## Overview

The `carousel` element displays images in a row that the user can navigate by swiping left and right on the remote. Here’s an example that creates a carousel containing three movie scenes that the user can navigate between.

```xml
<carousel>
    <section>
        <lockup>
            <img src="path to images on your server/Car_Movie_453x255_C.png" width="453" height="255" />
            <title>Scene 1</title>
        </lockup>
        <lockup>
            <img src="path to images on your server/Car_Movie_500x600.png" width="500" height="600" />
            <title>Scene 2</title>
        </lockup>
        <lockup>
            <img src="path to images on your server/Car_Movie_308x308_B.png" width="308" height="308" />
            <title>Scene 3</title>
        </lockup>
    </section>
