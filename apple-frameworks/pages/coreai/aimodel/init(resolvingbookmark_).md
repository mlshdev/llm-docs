<a id="return-value"></a>

## Discussion

Resolving bookmark data involves checking it is a valid bookmark, validating the associated cache and cache entry it references exists, and returning a AIModel constructed with that specialized asset contained within that entry. If any of these steps fail, nil is returned

> **Throws**

> If the bookmark data is malformed due to not being sourced from AIModel.bookmarkData an error is thrown
