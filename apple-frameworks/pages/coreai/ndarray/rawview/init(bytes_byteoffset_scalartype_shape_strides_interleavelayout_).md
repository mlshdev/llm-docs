# init(bytes:byteOffset:scalarType:shape:strides:interleaveLayout:)

**Framework:** Core AI

Initialize a raw view from existing raw memory, interpreted as the specified scalar type.

## Declaration

```swift
init(bytes: RawSpan, byteOffset: Int = 0, scalarType: NDArray.ScalarType, shape: [Int], strides: [Int] = [], interleaveLayout: NDArray.InterleaveLayout? = nil)
```

## Discussion

The lifetime of the resulting view copies the lifetime of the provided span.

Note that the provided `scalarType` will be stored and later checked if you attempt to convert the raw view to a typed view.

```swift
let myBytes: RawSpan = ...
let ndArrayRawView = NDArray.RawView(bytes: myBytes, scalarType: .float32, shape: [4, 5])

// This conversion is checked. If the type does not match the originally provided scalar type
// it will trap at runtime.
let floatView = ndArrayRawView.view(as: Float32.self)
```

The `shape/strides` must not be able to produce offsets that go outside of the range of `bytes`. As such, negative strides are not supported by this initializer.

**Performance note**: Making an ndArray view from a normal VM pointer to be used as an input or backing of an [InferenceFunction](../../inferencefunction.md) could be a performance anti-pattern if you intend to pass the same underlying memory in repeatedly to many inferences. This can be a function of which compute units the model was specialized for. For example if the inference function runs compute on the GPU or Neural Engine, you may incur a copy of the view into the required memory primitive if it cannot be toll-free converted.

- bytes: The raw bytes to be referenced by the resulting view.
- byteOffset: The offset into the span to be interpreted as the start of this view.
- scalarType: The type of scalars in the provided span.
- shape: The shape of the resulting view.
- strides: The strides of the resulting view. If left empty, they will be computed as contiguous row-major.
- interleaveLayout: Which dimension is interleaved and by what factor. See [NDArray.InterleaveLayout](../interleavelayout-swift.struct.md).
