final func hourlyStatistics<each T>(for location: CLLocation, startHour: Int, endHour: Int, including dataSets: repeat HourlyWeatherStatisticsQuery<each T>) async throws -> (repeat HourlyWeatherStatistics<each T>) where repeat each T : Decodable, repeat each T : Encodable, repeat each T : Equatable, repeat each T : Sendable
```

## Parameters

- `location`: The requested location.
- `startHour`: The first hour of the span, between 1 and 8784.

## Discussion

> **Throws**

> Weather data error `WeatherError`

The statistics returned for each hour are derived from weather data recorded over the past decades, to the present date. Each item returned represents statistics for a particular hour of the year, in UTC.

This is a variadic API in which any combination of data sets can be requested and returned as a tuple. The following example will return statistics for the first 24 hours of the year.

```swift
let hourlyTemperatureStatistics = try await service.hourlyStatistics(for: newYork, startHour: 1, endHour: 24, including: .temperature)
```

If the start hour is greater than the end hour, then a wrap around will occur. This next example will return statistics for hours 8783, 8784, 1, and 2.

```swift
let hourlyTemperatureStatistics = try await service.hourlyStatistics(for: newYork, startHour: 8783, endHour: 2, including: .temperature)
```

> **Precondition**

> `startHour in 1...8784 && endHour in 1...8784`
