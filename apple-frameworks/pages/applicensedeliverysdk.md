## Overview

This Swift SDK enables *digital rights management* (DRM) for alternative distribution apps. Use this SDK to generate licenses for alternative app marketplaces you build with [MarketplaceKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/marketplacekit) or other apps that you distribute from your website. Alternative app marketplaces use this SDK to generate a license for each app that developers distribute on the marketplace. By licensing each download individually, you provide a secure installation experience similar to the App Store.

Use this SDK’s framework to implement a license server on your website back end that’s capable of running compiled Swift code. Then, publish endpoints for your license server in a standard location that the device’s operating system expects. On an as-needed basis, the system retrieves licenses from your endpoints when a person downloads:

- An alternative app marketplace from your website
- An app that developers distribute on your alternative app marketplace
- An app that you develop and distribute on your website

The flow begins with a stage at left in the lower box that reads Install request. A line extends to its right to a stage that reads Checks licensing endpoint. The diagram flow continues with an arrow upward into the upper-box to a stage that reads Provides licensing endpoint. Flow returns to the prior stage in the lower box and then continues to the right to a stage that reads Requests app license. Flow continues with an arrow upward to a stage in the upper box that reads Swift licenseing endpoint, which contains another box within it that reads Generates app license. A callout extends from the inner stage that reads App License Delivery SDK. Flow returns to the prior stage in the lower box and then continues to the right to a stage that reads Downloads app.](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.AppLicenseDeliverySDK/app-license-delivery-hero@2x.png)

You can download this SDK from [Downloads](https://developer.apple.com/download/all/) if your developer account qualifies to distribute apps from your website. For more information, see  [Distributing your app from your website](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/marketplacekit/distributing-your-app-from-your-website).
