# commissioning(\_:needsWiFiCredentialsWithScanResults:error:completion:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Matter  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 26.2+ · iPadOS 26.2+ · Mac Catalyst 26.2+ · macOS 26.2+ · tvOS 26.2+ · visionOS 26.2+ · watchOS 26.2+

Callback that gets called for a commissionee that supports Wi-Fi if Wi-Fi network commissioning is required and Wi-Fi credentials were not provided in MTRCommissioningParameters.

## Declaration

```swift
optional func commissioning(_ commissioning: MTRCommissioningOperation, needsWiFiCredentialsWithScanResults networks: [MTRNetworkCommissioningClusterWiFiInterfaceScanResultStruct]?, error: (any Error)?, completion: @escaping @Sendable (Data, Data?) -> Void)
```

```swift
optional func commissioning(_ commissioning: MTRCommissioningOperation, needsWiFiCredentialsWithScanResults networks: [MTRNetworkCommissioningClusterWiFiInterfaceScanResultStruct]?, error: (any Error)?) async -> (Data, Data?)
```

## Discussion

Commissioning will pause, including in cases when the network scan failed, until the completion is invoked with the network and credentials the commissionee should use, or until commissioning is stopped.  The provided credentials are allowed to be nil for an open Wi-Fi network.

- error will be non-nil if a scan was attempted and failed.
- networks will be non-nil if a scan was attempted and succeeded.
- Both error and networks will be nil if no scan was performed.
