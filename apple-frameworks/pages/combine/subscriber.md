## Overview

A [Subscriber](subscriber.md) instance receives a stream of elements from a [Publisher](publisher.md), along with life cycle events describing changes to their relationship. A given subscriber’s [Input](subscriber/input.md) and [Failure](subscriber/failure.md) associated types must match the [Output](publisher/output.md) and [Failure](publisher/failure.md) of its corresponding publisher.

You connect a subscriber to a publisher by calling the publisher’s [subscribe(\_:)](publisher/subscribe%28__%29-4u8kn.md) method.  After making this call, the publisher invokes the subscriber’s [receive(subscription:)](subscriber/receive%28subscription_%29.md) method. This gives the subscriber a [Subscription](subscription.md) instance, which it uses to demand elements from the publisher, and to optionally cancel the subscription. After the subscriber makes an initial demand, the publisher calls [receive(\_:)](subscriber/receive%28__%29.md), possibly asynchronously, to deliver newly-published elements. If the publisher stops publishing, it calls [receive(completion:)](subscriber/receive%28completion_%29.md), using a parameter of type [Subscribers.Completion](subscribers/completion.md) to indicate whether publishing completes normally or with an error.

Combine provides the following subscribers as operators on the [Publisher](publisher.md) type:

- [sink(receiveCompletion:receiveValue:)](publisher/sink%28receivecompletion_receivevalue_%29.md) executes arbitrary closures when it receives a completion signal and each time it receives a new element.
- [assign(to:on:)](publisher/assign%28to_on_%29.md) writes each newly-received value to a property identified by a key path on a given instance.

## Topics

### Declaring supporting types

- [Input](subscriber/input.md): The kind of values this subscriber receives.
- [Failure](subscriber/failure.md): The kind of errors this subscriber might receive.

### Receiving elements

- [receive(\_:)](subscriber/receive%28__%29.md): Tells the subscriber that the publisher has produced an element.
- [receive()](subscriber/receive%28%29.md): Conforms when `Input` is `()`. Tells the subscriber that a publisher of void elements is ready to receive further requests.

### Receiving life cycle events

- [receive(subscription:)](subscriber/receive%28subscription_%29.md): Tells the subscriber that it has successfully subscribed to the publisher and may request items.
- [receive(completion:)](subscriber/receive%28completion_%29.md): Tells the subscriber that the publisher has completed publishing, either normally or with an error.
- [Subscribers.Completion](subscribers/completion.md): A signal that a publisher doesn’t produce additional elements, either due to normal completion or an error.
