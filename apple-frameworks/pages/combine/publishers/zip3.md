# Publishers.Zip3

**Framework:** Combine  
**Kind:** Structure  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 13.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 6.0+

A publisher created by applying the zip function to three upstream publishers.

## Declaration

```swift
struct Zip3<A, B, C> where A : Publisher, B : Publisher, C : Publisher, A.Failure == B.Failure, B.Failure == C.Failure
```

## Overview

Use a `Publishers.Zip3` to combine the latest elements from three publishers and emit a tuple to the downstream. The returned publisher waits until all three publishers have emitted an event, then delivers the oldest unconsumed event from each publisher as a tuple to the subscriber.

If any upstream publisher finishes successfully or fails with an error, so too does the zipped publisher.

## Topics

### Creating a zip-three Publisher

- [init(\_:\_:\_:)](zip3/init%28______%29.md): Creates a publisher that applies the zip function to three upstream publishers.

### Declaring supporting types

- [Publishers.Zip3.Output](zip3/output.md): The kind of values published by this publisher.
- [Publishers.Zip3.Failure](zip3/failure.md): The kind of errors this publisher might publish.

### Inspecting publisher properties

- [a](zip3/a.md): A publisher to zip.
- [b](zip3/b.md): A second publisher to zip.
- [c](zip3/c.md): A third publisher to zip.

### Comparing publishers

- [==(\_:\_:)](zip3/==%28____%29.md): Conforms when `A` conforms to `Publisher`, `A` conforms to `Equatable`, `B` conforms to `Publisher`, `B` conforms to `Equatable`, `C` conforms to `Publisher`, `C` conforms to `Equatable`, `A.Failure` is `B.Failure`, and `B.Failure` is `C.Failure`. Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether two publishers are equivalent.

### Default Implementations

- [Equatable Implementations](zip3/equatable-implementations.md)

## Relationships
