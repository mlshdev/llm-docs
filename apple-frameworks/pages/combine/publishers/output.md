A publisher that publishes elements specified by a range in the sequence of published elements.

## Declaration

```swift
struct Output<Upstream> where Upstream : Publisher
```

## Topics

### Creating an output publisher

- [init(upstream:range:)](output/init%28upstream_range_%29.md): Creates a publisher that publishes elements specified by a range.

### Declaring supporting types

- [Publishers.Output.Output](output/output.md): The kind of values published by this publisher.
- [Publishers.Output.Failure](output/failure.md): The kind of errors this publisher might publish.

### Inspecting publisher properties

- [upstream](output/upstream.md): The publisher from which this publisher receives its elements.
- [range](output/range.md): The range of elements to publish.

### Comparing publishers

- [==(\_:\_:)](output/==%28____%29.md): Conforms when `Upstream` conforms to `Publisher` and `Equatable`. Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether two publishers are equivalent.

### Default Implementations

- [Equatable Implementations](output/equatable-implementations.md)

## Relationships

- [Publishers.FirstWhere](firstwhere.md): A publisher that only publishes the first element of a stream to satisfy a predicate closure.
- [Publishers.TryFirstWhere](tryfirstwhere.md): A publisher that only publishes the first element of a stream to satisfy a throwing predicate closure.
- [Publishers.Last](last.md): A publisher that waits until after the stream finishes, and then publishes the last element of the stream.
- [Publishers.LastWhere](lastwhere.md): A publisher that waits until after the stream finishes and then publishes the last element of the stream that satisfies a predicate closure.
- [Publishers.TryLastWhere](trylastwhere.md): A publisher that waits until after the stream finishes and then publishes the last element of the stream that satisfies an error-throwing predicate closure.
