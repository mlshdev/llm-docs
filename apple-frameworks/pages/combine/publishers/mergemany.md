## Topics

### Creating a merge many publisher

- [init(\_:)](mergemany/init%28__%29-1hsqd.md): Creates a publisher created by applying the merge function to an arbitrary number of upstream publishers.
- [init(\_:)](mergemany/init%28__%29-3hrmo.md): Creates a publisher created by applying the merge function to a sequence of upstream publishers.

### Merging elements

- [merge(with:)](mergemany/merge%28with_%29.md): Combines elements from this publisher with those from another publisher of the same type, delivering an interleaved sequence of elements.

### Declaring supporting types

- [Publishers.MergeMany.Output](mergemany/output.md): The kind of values published by this publisher.
- [Publishers.MergeMany.Failure](mergemany/failure.md): The kind of errors this publisher might publish.

### Inspecting publisher properties

- [publishers](mergemany/publishers.md): The array of upstream publishers that this publisher merges together.

### Comparing publishers

- [==(\_:\_:)](mergemany/==%28____%29.md): Conforms when `Upstream` conforms to `Publisher` and `Equatable`. Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether two publishers are equivalent.

### Default Implementations

- [Equatable Implementations](mergemany/equatable-implementations.md)
