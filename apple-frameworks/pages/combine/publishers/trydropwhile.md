### Creating a try-drop-while publisher

- [init(upstream:predicate:)](trydropwhile/init%28upstream_predicate_%29.md): Creates a publisher that omits elements from an upstream publisher until a given error-throwing closure returns false.

### Declaring supporting types

- [Publishers.TryDropWhile.Output](trydropwhile/output.md): The kind of values published by this publisher.
- [Publishers.TryDropWhile.Failure](trydropwhile/failure.md): The kind of errors this publisher might publish.

### Inspecting publisher properties

- [upstream](trydropwhile/upstream.md): The publisher from which this publisher receives elements.
- [predicate](trydropwhile/predicate.md): The error-throwing closure that indicates whether to drop the element.
