## Topics

### Creating a try-scan publisher

- [init(upstream:initialResult:nextPartialResult:)](tryscan/init%28upstream_initialresult_nextpartialresult_%29.md): Creates a publisher that transforms elements from the upstream publisher by providing the current element to a failable closure along with the last value returned by the closure.

### Declaring supporting types

- [Publishers.Output](output.md): A publisher that publishes elements specified by a range in the sequence of published elements.
- [Publishers.TryScan.Failure](tryscan/failure.md): The kind of errors this publisher might publish.

### Inspecting publisher properties

- [upstream](tryscan/upstream.md): The publisher that this publisher receives elements from.
- [initialResult](tryscan/initialresult.md): The previous result returned by the `nextPartialResult` closure.
- [nextPartialResult](tryscan/nextpartialresult.md): An error-throwing closure that takes as its arguments the previous value returned by the closure and the next element emitted from the upstream publisher.
