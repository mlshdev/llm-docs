A publisher that emits a Boolean value upon receiving an element that satisfies the throwing predicate closure.

## Declaration

```swift
struct TryContainsWhere<Upstream> where Upstream : Publisher
```

## Topics

### Creating a try-contains-where publisher

- [init(upstream:predicate:)](trycontainswhere/init%28upstream_predicate_%29.md): Creates a publisher that emits a Boolean value upon receiving an element that satisfies the throwing predicate closure.

### Declaring supporting types

- [Publishers.TryContainsWhere.Output](trycontainswhere/output.md): The kind of values published by this publisher.
- [Publishers.TryContainsWhere.Failure](trycontainswhere/failure.md): The kind of errors this publisher might publish.

### Inspecting publisher properties

- [upstream](trycontainswhere/upstream.md): The publisher from which this publisher receives elements.
- [predicate](trycontainswhere/predicate.md): The error-throwing closure that determines whether this publisher should emit a Boolean true element.

## Relationships

### Conforms To

- [Publisher](../publisher.md)

### Applying matching criteria to elements

- [Publishers.Contains](contains.md): A publisher that emits a Boolean value when it receives a specific element from its upstream publisher.
- [Publishers.ContainsWhere](containswhere.md): A publisher that emits a Boolean value upon receiving an element that satisfies the predicate closure.
- [Publishers.AllSatisfy](allsatisfy.md): A publisher that publishes a single Boolean value that indicates whether all received elements pass a given predicate.
- [Publishers.TryAllSatisfy](tryallsatisfy.md): A publisher that publishes a single Boolean value that indicates whether all received elements pass a given error-throwing predicate.
