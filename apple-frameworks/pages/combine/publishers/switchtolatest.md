## Overview

Given a publisher that publishes [Publisher](../publisher.md) instances, the [Publishers.SwitchToLatest](switchtolatest.md) publisher produces a sequence of events from only the most recent one. For example, given the type `AnyPublisher<URLSession.DataTaskPublisher,NSError>`, calling `switchToLatest()` results in the type `SwitchToLatest<(Data, URLResponse), URLError>`. The downstream subscriber sees a continuous stream of `(Data, URLResponse)` elements from what looks like a single [URLSession.DataTaskPublisher](../../foundation/urlsession/datataskpublisher.md) even though the elements are coming from different upstream publishers.

When [Publishers.SwitchToLatest](switchtolatest.md) receives a new publisher from the upstream publisher, it cancels its previous subscription. Use this feature to prevent earlier publishers from performing unnecessary work, such as creating network request publishers from frequently-updating user interface publishers.
