A publisher that publishes the first element of a stream, then finishes.

## Declaration

```swift
struct First<Upstream> where Upstream : Publisher
```

## Topics

### Creating a first publisher

- [init(upstream:)](first/init%28upstream_%29.md): Creates a publisher that publishes the first element of a stream, then finishes.

### Declaring supporting types

- [Publishers.First.Output](first/output.md): The kind of values published by this publisher.
- [Publishers.First.Failure](first/failure.md): The kind of errors this publisher might publish.

### Inspecting publisher properties

- [upstream](first/upstream.md): The publisher from which this publisher receives elements.

### Comparing publishers

- [==(\_:\_:)](first/==%28____%29.md): Conforms when `Upstream` conforms to `Publisher` and `Equatable`. Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether two first publishers have equal upstream publishers.

### Default Implementations

- [Equatable Implementations](first/equatable-implementations.md)

## Relationships

- [Publishers.Last](last.md): A publisher that waits until after the stream finishes, and then publishes the last element of the stream.

- [Publishers.TryLastWhere](trylastwhere.md): A publisher that waits until after the stream finishes and then publishes the last element of the stream that satisfies an error-throwing predicate closure.
- [Publishers.Output](output.md): A publisher that publishes elements specified by a range in the sequence of published elements.
