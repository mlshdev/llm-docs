## Overview

Subscriptions are class constrained because a [Subscription](subscription.md) has identity, defined by the moment in time a particular subscriber attached to a publisher. Canceling a [Subscription](subscription.md) must be thread-safe.

You can only cancel a [Subscription](subscription.md) once.

Canceling a subscription frees up any resources previously allocated by attaching the [Subscriber](subscriber.md).

## Topics

### Requesting elements

- [request(\_:)](subscription/request%28__%29.md): Tells a publisher that it may send more values to the subscriber.
