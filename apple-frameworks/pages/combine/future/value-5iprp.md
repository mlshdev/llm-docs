## Discussion

This property subscribes to the `Future` and delivers the value asynchronously when the `Future` publishes it. If the `Future` terminates with an error, the awaiting caller receives the error instead. Use this property when you want to the `async`-`await` syntax with a `Future` whose [Failure](../publisher/failure.md) type is not [Never](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/never).
