# timeout(\_:scheduler:options:customError:)

**Framework:** Combine  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 13.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 6.0+

Terminates publishing if the upstream publisher exceeds the specified time interval without producing an element.

## Declaration

```swift
func timeout<S>(_ interval: S.SchedulerTimeType.Stride, scheduler: S, options: S.SchedulerOptions? = nil, customError: (() -> Self.Failure)? = nil) -> Publishers.Timeout<Self, S> where S : Scheduler
```

## Parameters

- `interval`: The maximum time interval the publisher can go without emitting an element, expressed in the time system of the scheduler.
- `scheduler`: The scheduler on which to deliver events.
- `options`: Scheduler options that customize the delivery of elements.
- `customError`: A closure that executes if the publisher times out. The publisher sends the failure returned by this closure to the subscriber as the reason for termination.

## Return Value

A publisher that terminates if the specified interval elapses with no events received from the upstream publisher.

## Discussion

Use [timeout(\_:scheduler:options:customError:)](timeout%28__scheduler_options_customerror_%29.md) to terminate a publisher if an element isn’t delivered within a timeout interval you specify.

In the example below, a [PassthroughSubject](../passthroughsubject.md) publishes [String](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/string) elements and is configured to time out if no new elements are received within its `TIME_OUT` window of 5 seconds. A single value is published after the specified 2-second `WAIT_TIME`, after which no more elements are available; the publisher then times out and completes normally.

```swift
var WAIT_TIME : Int = 2
var TIMEOUT_TIME : Int = 5

let subject = PassthroughSubject<String, Never>()
let cancellable = subject
    .timeout(.seconds(TIMEOUT_TIME), scheduler: DispatchQueue.main, options: nil, customError:nil)
    .sink(
          receiveCompletion: { print ("completion: \($0) at \(Date())") },
          receiveValue: { print ("value: \($0) at \(Date())") }
     )

DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + .seconds(WAIT_TIME),
                              execute: { subject.send("Some data - sent after a delay of \(WAIT_TIME) seconds") } )

// Prints: value: Some data - sent after a delay of 2 seconds at 2020-03-10 23:47:59 +0000
//         completion: finished at 2020-03-10 23:48:04 +0000
```

If `customError` is `nil`, the publisher completes normally; if you provide a closure for the `customError` argument, the upstream publisher is instead terminated upon timeout, and the error is delivered to the downstream.
