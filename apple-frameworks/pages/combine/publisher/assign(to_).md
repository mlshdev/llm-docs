# assign(to:)

**Framework:** Combine

Republishes elements received from a publisher, by assigning them to a property marked as a publisher.

## Declaration

```swift
func assign(to published: inout Published<Self.Output>.Publisher)
```

## Parameters

- `published`: A property marked with the `@Published` attribute, which receives and republishes all elements received from the upstream publisher.

## Discussion

Use this operator when you want to receive elements from a publisher and republish them through a property marked with the `@Published` attribute. The `assign(to:)` operator manages the life cycle of the subscription, canceling the subscription automatically when the [Published](../published.md) instance deinitializes. Because of this, the `assign(to:)` operator doesn’t return an [AnyCancellable](../anycancellable.md) that you’re responsible for like [assign(to:on:)](assign%28to_on_%29.md) does.

The example below shows a model class that receives elements from an internal [Timer.TimerPublisher](../../foundation/timer/timerpublisher.md), and assigns them to a `@Published` property called `lastUpdated`. Because the `to` parameter has the `inout` keyword, you need to use the `&` operator when calling this method.

```swift
class MyModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var lastUpdated: Date = Date()
    init() {
         Timer.publish(every: 1.0, on: .main, in: .common)
             .autoconnect()
             .assign(to: &$lastUpdated)
    }
}
```

If you instead implemented `MyModel` with `assign(to: lastUpdated, on: self)`, storing the returned [AnyCancellable](../anycancellable.md) instance could cause a reference cycle, because the [Subscribers.Assign](../subscribers/assign.md) subscriber would hold a strong reference to `self`. Using `assign(to:)` solves this problem.

While the `to` parameter uses the `inout` keyword, this method doesn’t replace a reference type passed to it. Instead, this notation indicates that the operator may modify members of the assigned object, as seen in the following example:

```swift
    class MyModel2: ObservableObject {
        @Published var id: Int = 0
    }
    let model2 = MyModel2()
    Just(100).assign(to: &model2.$id)
```

- [assign(to:on:)](assign%28to_on_%29.md): Conforms when `Failure` is `Never`. Assigns each element from a publisher to a property on an object.
- [sink(receiveCompletion:receiveValue:)](sink%28receivecompletion_receivevalue_%29.md): Attaches a subscriber with closure-based behavior.
- [sink(receiveValue:)](sink%28receivevalue_%29.md): Conforms when `Failure` is `Never`. Attaches a subscriber with closure-based behavior to a publisher that never fails.
