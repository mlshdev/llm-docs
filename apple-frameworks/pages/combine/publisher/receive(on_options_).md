## Discussion

You use the [receive(on:options:)](receive%28on_options_%29.md) operator to receive results and completion on a specific scheduler, such as performing UI work on the main run loop. In contrast with [subscribe(on:options:)](subscribe%28on_options_%29.md), which affects upstream messages, [receive(on:options:)](receive%28on_options_%29.md) changes the execution context of downstream messages.

In the following example, the [subscribe(on:options:)](subscribe%28on_options_%29.md) operator causes `jsonPublisher` to receive requests on `backgroundQueue`, while the [receive(on:options:)](receive%28on_options_%29.md) causes `labelUpdater` to receive elements and completion on `RunLoop.main`.

```swift
let jsonPublisher = MyJSONLoaderPublisher() // Some publisher.
let labelUpdater = MyLabelUpdateSubscriber() // Some subscriber that updates the UI.

jsonPublisher
    .subscribe(on: backgroundQueue)
    .receive(on: RunLoop.main)
    .subscribe(labelUpdater)
```

Prefer [receive(on:options:)](receive%28on_options_%29.md) over explicit use of dispatch queues when performing work in subscribers. For example, instead of the following pattern:

```swift
pub.sink {
    DispatchQueue.main.async {
        // Do something.
    }
}
```

Use this pattern instead:

```swift
pub.receive(on: DispatchQueue.main).sink {
    // Do something.
}
```

> **Note**

> [receive(on:options:)](receive%28on_options_%29.md) doesn’t affect the scheduler used to call the subscriber’s [receive(subscription:)](../subscriber/receive%28subscription_%29.md) method.
