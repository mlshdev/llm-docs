# zip(\_:)

**Framework:** Combine  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 13.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 6.0+

Combines elements from another publisher and deliver pairs of elements as tuples.

## Declaration

```swift
func zip<P>(_ other: P) -> Publishers.Zip<Self, P> where P : Publisher, Self.Failure == P.Failure
```

## Parameters

- `other`: Another publisher.

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

A publisher that emits pairs of elements from the upstream publishers as tuples.

<a id="discussion"></a>

## Discussion

Use [zip(\_:)](zip%28__%29.md) to combine the latest elements from two publishers and emit a tuple to the downstream. The returned publisher waits until both publishers have emitted an event, then delivers the oldest unconsumed event from each publisher together as a tuple to the subscriber.

Much like a zipper or zip fastener on a piece of clothing pulls together rows of teeth to link the two sides, [zip(\_:)](zip%28__%29.md) combines streams from two different publishers by linking pairs of elements from each side.

In this example, `numbers` and `letters` are [PassthroughSubject](../passthroughsubject.md)s that emit values; once [zip(\_:)](zip%28__%29.md) receives one value from each, it publishes the pair as a tuple to the downstream subscriber. It then waits for the next pair of values.

```swift
 let numbersPub = PassthroughSubject<Int, Never>()
 let lettersPub = PassthroughSubject<String, Never>()

 cancellable = numbersPub
     .zip(lettersPub)
     .sink { print("\($0)") }
 numbersPub.send(1)    // numbersPub: 1      lettersPub:        zip output: <none>
 numbersPub.send(2)    // numbersPub: 1,2    lettersPub:        zip output: <none>
 letters.send("A")     // numbers: 1,2       letters:"A"        zip output: <none>
 numbers.send(3)       // numbers: 1,2,3     letters:           zip output: (1,"A")
 letters.send("B")     // numbers: 1,2,3     letters: "B"       zip output: (2,"B")

 // Prints:
 //  (1, "A")
 //  (2, "B")
```

If either upstream publisher finishes successfully or fails with an error, the zipped publisher does the same.
