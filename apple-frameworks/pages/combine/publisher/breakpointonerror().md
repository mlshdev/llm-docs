## Return Value

## Discussion

When the upstream publisher fails with an error, this publisher raises the `SIGTRAP` signal, which stops the process in the debugger. Otherwise, this publisher passes through values and completions as-is.

In this example a [PassthroughSubject](../passthroughsubject.md) publishes strings, but its downstream [tryMap(\_:)](trymap%28__%29.md) operator throws an error. This sends the error downstream as a [Subscribers.Completion.failure(\_:)](../subscribers/completion/failure%28__%29.md). The [breakpointOnError()](breakpointonerror%28%29.md) operator receives this completion and stops the app in the debugger.

```swift
 struct CustomError : Error {}
 let publisher = PassthroughSubject<String?, Error>()
 cancellable = publisher
     .tryMap { stringValue in
         throw CustomError()
     }
     .breakpointOnError()
     .sink(
         receiveCompletion: { completion in print("Completion: \(String(describing: completion))") },
         receiveValue: { aValue in print("Result: \(String(describing: aValue))") }
     )

 publisher.send("TEST DATA")

 // Prints: "error: Execution was interrupted, reason: signal SIGTRAP."
 // Depending on your specific environment, the console messages may
 // also include stack trace information, which is not shown here.
```

- [breakpoint(receiveSubscription:receiveOutput:receiveCompletion:)](breakpoint%28receivesubscription_receiveoutput_receivecompletion_%29.md): Raises a debugger signal when a provided closure needs to stop the process in the debugger.
- [handleEvents(receiveSubscription:receiveOutput:receiveCompletion:receiveCancel:receiveRequest:)](handleevents%28receivesubscription_receiveoutput_receivecompletion_receivecancel_receiverequest_%29.md): Performs the specified closures when publisher events occur.
- [print(\_:to:)](print%28__to_%29.md): Prints log messages for all publishing events.
