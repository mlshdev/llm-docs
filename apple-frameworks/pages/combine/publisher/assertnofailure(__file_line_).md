# assertNoFailure(\_:file:line:)

**Framework:** Combine  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 13.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 6.0+

Raises a fatal error when its upstream publisher fails, and otherwise republishes all received input.

## Declaration

```swift
func assertNoFailure(_ prefix: String = "", file: StaticString = #file, line: UInt = #line) -> Publishers.AssertNoFailure<Self>
```

## Parameters

- `prefix`: A string used at the beginning of the fatal error message.
- `file`: A filename used in the error message. This defaults to `#file`.
- `line`: A line number used in the error message. This defaults to `#line`.

## Discussion

Use `assertNoFailure()` for internal integrity checks that are active during testing. However, it is important to note that, like its Swift counterpart `fatalError(_:)`, the `assertNoFailure()` operator asserts a fatal exception when triggered during development and testing, *and* in shipping versions of code.

In the example below, a `CurrentValueSubject` publishes the initial and second values successfully. The third value, containing a `genericSubjectError`, causes the `assertNoFailure()` operator to assert a fatal exception stopping the process:

```swift
public enum SubjectError: Error {
    case genericSubjectError
}

let subject = CurrentValueSubject<String, Error>("initial value")
subject
    .assertNoFailure()
    .sink(receiveCompletion: { print ("completion: \($0)") },
          receiveValue: { print ("value: \($0).") }
    )

subject.send("second value")
subject.send(completion: Subscribers.Completion<Error>.failure(SubjectError.genericSubjectError))

// Prints:
//  value: initial value.
//  value: second value.
//  The process then terminates in the debugger as the assertNoFailure operator catches the genericSubjectError.
```

### Handling errors

- [catch(\_:)](catch%28__%29.md): Handles errors from an upstream publisher by replacing it with another publisher.
- [tryCatch(\_:)](trycatch%28__%29.md): Handles errors from an upstream publisher by either replacing it with another publisher or throwing a new error.
- [retry(\_:)](retry%28__%29.md): Attempts to recreate a failed subscription with the upstream publisher up to the number of times you specify.
