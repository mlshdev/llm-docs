The elements produced by the publisher, as an asynchronous sequence.

## Declaration

```swift
var values: AsyncPublisher<Self> { get }
```

## Discussion

This property provides an [AsyncPublisher](../asyncpublisher.md), which allows you to use the Swift `async`-`await` syntax to receive the publisher’s elements. Because [AsyncPublisher](../asyncpublisher.md) conforms to [AsyncSequence](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/asyncsequence), you iterate over its elements with a `for`-`await`-`in` loop, rather than attaching a subscriber.

The following example shows how to use the `values` property to receive elements asynchronously. The example adapts a code snippet from the [filter(\_:)](filter%28__%29.md) operator’s documentation, which filters a sequence to only emit even integers. This example replaces the [Subscribers.Sink](../subscribers/sink.md) subscriber with a `for`-`await`-`in` loop that iterates over the [AsyncPublisher](../asyncpublisher.md) provided by the `values` property.

```swift
let numbers: [Int] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let filtered = numbers.publisher
    .filter { $0 % 2 == 0 }

for await number in filtered.values
{
    print("\(number)", terminator: " ")
}
```
