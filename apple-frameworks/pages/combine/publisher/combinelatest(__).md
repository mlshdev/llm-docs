# combineLatest(\_:)

**Framework:** Combine  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 13.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 6.0+

Subscribes to an additional publisher and publishes a tuple upon receiving output from either publisher.

## Declaration

```swift
func combineLatest<P>(_ other: P) -> Publishers.CombineLatest<Self, P> where P : Publisher, Self.Failure == P.Failure
```

## Parameters

- `other`: Another publisher to combine with this one.

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

A publisher that receives and combines elements from this and another publisher.

<a id="discussion"></a>

## Discussion

Use [combineLatest(\_:)](combinelatest%28__%29.md) when you want the downstream subscriber to receive a tuple of the most-recent element from multiple publishers when any of them emit a value. To pair elements from multiple publishers, use [zip(\_:)](zip%28__%29.md) instead. To receive just the most-recent element from multiple publishers rather than tuples, use [merge(with:)](merge%28with_%29-7qt71.md).

> **Tip**

> The combined publisher doesn’t produce elements until each of its upstream publishers publishes at least one element.

The combined publisher passes through any requests to *all* upstream publishers. However, it still obeys the demand-fulfilling rule of only sending the request amount downstream. If the demand isn’t [unlimited](../subscribers/demand/unlimited.md), it drops values from upstream publishers. It implements this by using a buffer size of 1 for each upstream, and holds the most-recent value in each buffer.

In this example, [PassthroughSubject](../passthroughsubject.md) `pub1` and also `pub2` emit values; as [combineLatest(\_:)](combinelatest%28__%29.md) receives input from either upstream publisher, it combines the latest value from each publisher into a tuple and publishes it.

```swift
let pub1 = PassthroughSubject<Int, Never>()
let pub2 = PassthroughSubject<Int, Never>()

cancellable = pub1
    .combineLatest(pub2)
    .sink { print("Result: \($0).") }

pub1.send(1)
pub1.send(2)
pub2.send(2)
pub1.send(3)
pub1.send(45)
pub2.send(22)

// Prints:
//    Result: (2, 2).    // pub1 latest = 2, pub2 latest = 2
//    Result: (3, 2).    // pub1 latest = 3, pub2 latest = 2
//    Result: (45, 2).   // pub1 latest = 45, pub2 latest = 2
//    Result: (45, 22).  // pub1 latest = 45, pub2 latest = 22
```

When all upstream publishers finish, this publisher finishes. If an upstream publisher never publishes a value, this publisher never finishes.
