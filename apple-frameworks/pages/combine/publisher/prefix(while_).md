Republishes elements while a predicate closure indicates publishing should continue.

## Declaration

```swift
func prefix(while predicate: @escaping (Self.Output) -> Bool) -> Publishers.PrefixWhile<Self>
```

## Parameters

- `predicate`: A closure that takes an element as its parameter and returns a Boolean value that indicates whether publishing should continue.

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

A publisher that passes through elements until the predicate indicates publishing should finish.

<a id="discussion"></a>

## Discussion

Use [prefix(while:)](prefix%28while_%29.md) to emit values while elements from the upstream publisher meet a condition you specify. The publisher finishes when the closure returns `false`.

In the example below, the [prefix(while:)](prefix%28while_%29.md) operator emits values while the element it receives is less than five:

```swift
let numbers = (0...10)
numbers.publisher
    .prefix { $0 < 5 }
    .sink { print("\($0)", terminator: " ") }

// Prints: "0 1 2 3 4"
```

### Applying sequence operations to elements

- [drop(untilOutputFrom:)](drop%28untiloutputfrom_%29.md): Ignores elements from the upstream publisher until it receives an element from a second publisher.
- [dropFirst(\_:)](dropfirst%28__%29.md): Omits the specified number of elements before republishing subsequent elements.
- [drop(while:)](drop%28while_%29.md): Omits elements from the upstream publisher until a given closure returns false, before republishing all remaining elements.
- [tryDrop(while:)](trydrop%28while_%29.md): Omits elements from the upstream publisher until an error-throwing closure returns false, before republishing all remaining elements.
- [append(\_:)](append%28__%29-1qb8d.md): Appends a publisher’s output with the specified elements.
- [append(\_:)](append%28__%29-69sdn.md): Appends a publisher’s output with the specified sequence.
- [append(\_:)](append%28__%29-5yh02.md): Appends the output of this publisher with the elements emitted by the given publisher.
- [prepend(\_:)](prepend%28__%29-7wk5l.md): Prefixes a publisher’s output with the specified values.
- [prepend(\_:)](prepend%28__%29-v9sb.md): Prefixes a publisher’s output with the specified sequence.
- [prepend(\_:)](prepend%28__%29-5dj9c.md): Prefixes the output of this publisher with the elements emitted by the given publisher.
- [prefix(\_:)](prefix%28__%29.md): Republishes elements up to the specified maximum count.
- [tryPrefix(while:)](tryprefix%28while_%29.md): Republishes elements while an error-throwing predicate closure indicates publishing should continue.
- [prefix(untilOutputFrom:)](prefix%28untiloutputfrom_%29.md): Republishes elements until another publisher emits an element.
