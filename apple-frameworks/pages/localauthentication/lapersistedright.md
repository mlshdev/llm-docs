# LAPersistedRight (Swift)

**Framework:** Local Authentication  
**Kind:** Class  
**Availability:** iOS 16.0+ · iPadOS 16.0+ · Mac Catalyst 16.0+ · macOS 13.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

A right that gates access to a key and a secret.

## Declaration

```swift
class LAPersistedRight
```

## Overview

An [LAPersistedRight](lapersistedright.md) is a right that’s backed by a unique key in the Secure Enclave with an access control list that matches the authorization requirements of the right. You can access the key that backs a right to perform cryptographic operations like encryption, decryption, signing, and verification.

You can use the key that backs an [LAPersistedRight](lapersistedright.md) to perform both public key and private key operations, but private key operations — like decryption, signing, and key exchange — are only available after you authorize the right. Public key operations like encryption and verification are always available.

The following generates a right with the default authorization requirements, stores it in the [shared](larightstore/shared.md) [LARightStore](larightstore.md), and exports the public key so that you can use it to verify signatures that the corresponding private key produces:

```swift
func generateClientKeys() async throws -> Data {
    let right = LARight()
    let persistedRight = try await LARightStore.shared.saveRight(right, identifier: "server-access")
    return try await persistedRight.key.publicKey.bytes
}
```

The following uses the private key associated with the right from the previous example to sign a challenge issued by a server:

```swift
func signServerChallenge(nonce: Data) async throws -> Data {
    let persistedRight = try await LARightStore.shared.right(forIdentifier: "server-access")
    try await persistedRight.authorize(localizedReason: "Access the sandcastle competition server")

    guard persistedRight.key.canSign(using: .ecdsaSignatureMessageX962SHA256) else {
        throw NSError(domain: "ExampleErrorDomain", code: -1, userInfo: [:])
    }
    
    return try await persistedRight.key.sign(nonce, algorithm: .ecdsaSignatureMessageX962SHA256)
}
```

The signature operation occurs after verifying that the user has the proper authorization and confirming that the private key supports the given signing algorithm.
