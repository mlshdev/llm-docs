# donate(completion:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Intents  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 10.0+ · iPadOS 10.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 11.0+ · tvOS 14.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 3.2+

Donates this interaction object to the system.

## Declaration

```swift
func donate(completion: (@Sendable ((any Error)?) -> Void)? = nil)
```

```swift
func donate() async throws
```

## Parameters

- `completion`: A block to execute with the results. Provide a block if you want to know whether the interaction was donated successfully. The block has no return value and takes the following parameter.

  - **error**: An error object indicating a problem occurred. On success, this parameter is `nil`. If there was an error, this parameter contains an error object describing what happened.

## Discussion

Call this method from your app when you want to donate a SiriKit interaction to the system to help improve search results. If you provide a block in the `completion` parameter, the system executes your block asynchronously with the results.

> **Important**

>  Do not donate multiple interaction object representing the same user interaction. Each donated interaction should represent a single event that was handled by your app. For example, when sending a message to multiple recipients, a messaging app should donate only one interaction object, and the [INSendMessageIntent](../insendmessageintent.md) object included in that interaction should contain the complete list of recipients. The app should not donate separate interactions for each recipient.
