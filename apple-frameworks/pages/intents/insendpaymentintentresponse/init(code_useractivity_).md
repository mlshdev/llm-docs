# init(code:userActivity:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Intents  
**Kind:** Initializer  
**Availability:** iOS 10.0+ · iPadOS 10.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 3.2+

Initializes the response object with the specified code and user activity object.

## Declaration

```swift
init(code: INSendPaymentIntentResponseCode, userActivity: NSUserActivity?)
```

## Parameters

- `code`: The response code indicating your success or failure in handling the intent. For a list of possible values, see [INSendPaymentIntentResponseCode](../insendpaymentintentresponsecode.md).
- `userActivity`: The user activity object to use when launching your app. Provide an object if you want to add information that is specific to your app. If you specify `nil`, the system automatically creates a user activity object for you, sets its type to the class name of the intent being handled, and fills it with an [INInteraction](../ininteraction.md) object containing the intent and your response.

## Return Value

An initialized response object or `nil` if the object could not be created.

## Discussion

After initializing the response object, put the details of how you are handling the payment into an [INPaymentRecord](../inpaymentrecord.md) object and assign that object to the [paymentRecord](paymentrecord.md) property. The payment record contains the details for Siri to display to the user.
