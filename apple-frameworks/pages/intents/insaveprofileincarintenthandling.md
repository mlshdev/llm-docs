## Overview

Automotive vendors can support the [INSaveProfileInCarIntentHandling](insaveprofileincarintenthandling.md) protocol in an Intents extension that they ship with their automotive apps. Use the methods of this protocol to resolve, confirm, and handle requests to save vehicle-related settings to the profile that the user designated. Your extension should be able to communicate with the vehicle and save the necessary settings.

Siri delivers an [INSaveProfileInCarIntent](insaveprofileincarintent.md) object to your handler when the user asks to save the current settings to a specific profile. The provided intent object contains information that you use to determine where to save the settings.
