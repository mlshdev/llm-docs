# setCancelHandler(qos:flags:handler:)

**Framework:** Dispatch  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS · iPadOS · Mac Catalyst · macOS · tvOS · visionOS · watchOS

Sets the cancellation handler block for the dispatch source with the specified quality-of-service class and work item options.

## Declaration

```swift
func setCancelHandler(qos: DispatchQoS = .unspecified, flags: DispatchWorkItemFlags = [], handler: Self.DispatchSourceHandler?)
```

## Parameters

- `qos`: The quality-of-service to apply to the handler block.
- `flags`: Configuration flags for the work item. For a list of possible values, see [DispatchWorkItemFlags](../dispatchworkitemflags.md).
- `handler`: The event handler block to submit to the source’s target queue.

## Discussion

The cancellation handler (if specified) is submitted to the source’s target queue in response to a call to a call to the [cancel()](cancel%28%29.md) method once the system has released all references to the source’s underlying handle and the source’s event handler block has returned.

To safely close a file descriptor or destroy a Mach port, a cancellation handler is required for that descriptor or port. Closing the descriptor or port before the cancellation handler runs can result in a race condition. If a new descriptor is allocated with the same value as the recently closed descriptor while the source’s event handler is still running, the event handler may read/write data using the wrong descriptor.

- [cancel()](cancel%28%29.md): Asynchronously cancels the dispatch source, preventing any further invocation of its event handler block.
- [isCancelled](iscancelled.md): Returns a Boolean indicating whether the given dispatch source has been canceled.
- [setCancelHandler(handler:)](setcancelhandler%28handler_%29.md): Sets the cancellation handler block for the dispatch source.
