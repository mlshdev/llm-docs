# Dispatch Source (Swift)

**Framework:** Dispatch  
**Kind:** API Collection

An object that coordinates the processing of specific low-level system events, such as file-system events, timers, and UNIX signals.

## Topics

### Creating a Dispatch Source

- [dispatch_source_t](dispatch_source_t.md): An object that coordinates the processing of specific low-level system events, such as file-system events, timers, and UNIX signals.

### Getting Dispatch Source Attributes

- [dispatch_source_mach_recv_flags_t](dispatch_source_mach_recv_flags_t.md): Mach receive-right flags.

### System Event Monitoring

- [DispatchSource](dispatchsource.md): An object that coordinates the processing of specific low-level system events, such as file-system events, timers, and UNIX signals.
- [DispatchIO](dispatchio.md): An object that manages operations on a file descriptor using either stream-based or random-access semantics.
- [DispatchData](dispatchdata.md): An object that manages a memory-based data buffer and exposes it as a contiguous block of memory.
- [DispatchDataIterator](dispatchdataiterator.md): A byte-by-byte iterator over the contents of a dispatch data object.
- [Dispatch I/O](dispatch-i-o.md): An object that manages operations on a file descriptor using either stream-based or random-access semantics.
- [Dispatch Data](dispatch-data.md): An object that manages a memory-based data buffer and exposes it as a contiguous block of memory.
- [DispatchSourceProtocol](dispatchsourceprotocol.md): Defines a common set of properties and methods that are shared with all dispatch source types.

# Dispatch Source (Objective-C)

**Framework:** Dispatch  
**Kind:** API Collection

An object that coordinates the processing of specific low-level system events, such as file-system events, timers, and UNIX signals.

## Topics

### Creating a Dispatch Source

- [dispatch_source_create](dispatch_source_create.md): Creates a new dispatch source to monitor low-level system events.
- [dispatch_source_t](dispatch_source_t.md): An object that coordinates the processing of specific low-level system events, such as file-system events, timers, and UNIX signals.
- [dispatch_source_type_t](dispatch_source_type_t.md): An identifier for the type of system object being monitored by a dispatch source.

### Managing Event Handlers

- [dispatch_source_set_registration_handler_f](dispatch_source_set_registration_handler_f.md): Sets the registration handler function for the given dispatch source.
- [dispatch_source_set_registration_handler](dispatch_source_set_registration_handler.md): Sets the registration handler block for the given dispatch source.
- [dispatch_source_set_event_handler_f](dispatch_source_set_event_handler_f.md): Sets the event handler function for the given dispatch source.
- [dispatch_source_set_event_handler](dispatch_source_set_event_handler.md): Sets the event handler block for the given dispatch source.
- [dispatch_source_set_cancel_handler_f](dispatch_source_set_cancel_handler_f.md): Sets the cancellation handler function for the given dispatch source.
- [dispatch_source_set_cancel_handler](dispatch_source_set_cancel_handler.md): Sets the cancellation handler block for the given dispatch source.

### Getting Dispatch Source Attributes

- [dispatch_source_get_data](dispatch_source_get_data.md): Returns pending data for the dispatch source.
- [dispatch_source_get_mask](dispatch_source_get_mask.md): Returns the mask of events monitored by the dispatch source.
- [dispatch_source_get_handle](dispatch_source_get_handle.md): Returns the underlying system handle associated with the specified dispatch source.
- [dispatch_source_merge_data](dispatch_source_merge_data.md): Merges data into a dispatch source and submits its event handler block to its target queue.
- [dispatch_source_proc_flags_t](dispatch_source_proc_flags_t.md): Events related to a process.
- [dispatch_source_vnode_flags_t](dispatch_source_vnode_flags_t.md): Events involving a change to a file system object.
- [dispatch_source_mach_recv_flags_t](dispatch_source_mach_recv_flags_t.md): Mach receive-right flags.
- [dispatch_source_mach_send_flags_t](dispatch_source_mach_send_flags_t.md): Mach send-right flags.
- [dispatch_source_memorypressure_flags_t](dispatch_source_memorypressure_flags_t.md): Memory pressure events.

### Managing Timer Parameters

- [dispatch_source_set_timer](dispatch_source_set_timer.md): Sets a start time, interval, and leeway value for a timer source.
- [dispatch_source_timer_flags_t](dispatch_source_timer_flags_t.md): Flags to use when configuring a timer dispatch source.

### Canceling a Dispatch Source

- [dispatch_source_cancel](dispatch_source_cancel.md): Asynchronously cancels the dispatch source, preventing any further invocation of its event handler block.
- [dispatch_source_testcancel](dispatch_source_testcancel.md): Tests whether the given dispatch source has been canceled.
