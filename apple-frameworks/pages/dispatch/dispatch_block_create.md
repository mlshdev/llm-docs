# dispatch_block_create

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** Dispatch  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ · iPadOS 8.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.10+ · tvOS · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

Creates a new dispatch block on the heap using an existing block and the given flags.

## Declaration

```objectivec
extern dispatch_block_t dispatch_block_create(dispatch_block_flags_t flags, dispatch_block_t block);
```

## Parameters

- `flags`: Configuration flags for the block object. For possible values, see [dispatch_block_flags_t](dispatch_block_flags_t.md).

  Passing a value that is not a bitwise OR of valid flags results in `NULL` being returned.
- `block`: The block to create the dispatch block from.

## Return Value

The newly created dispatch block, or `NULL`.

## Discussion

The provided block is copied to the heap and retained by the newly created dispatch block.

The returned dispatch block is intended to be submitted to a dispatch queue with [dispatch_async](dispatch_async.md) and related functions, but may also be invoked directly. Both operations can be performed an arbitrary number of times but only the first completed execution of a dispatch block can be waited on with [dispatch_block_wait](dispatch_block_wait.md) or observed with [dispatch_block_notify](dispatch_block_notify.md).

If the returned dispatch block is submitted to a dispatch queue, the submitted block instance is associated with the QoS class current at the time of submission, unless one of the following flags assigned a specific QoS class (or no QoS class) at the time of block creation:

- [DISPATCH_BLOCK_ASSIGN_CURRENT](dispatch_block_flags_t/dispatch_block_assign_current.md)
- [DISPATCH_BLOCK_NO_QOS_CLASS](dispatch_block_flags_t/dispatch_block_no_qos_class.md)
- [DISPATCH_BLOCK_DETACHED](dispatch_block_flags_t/dispatch_block_detached.md)

The QoS class the block object is executed with also depends on the QoS class assigned to the queue and which of the following flags was specified or defaulted to:

- [DISPATCH_BLOCK_INHERIT_QOS_CLASS](dispatch_block_flags_t/dispatch_block_inherit_qos_class.md) (default for asynchronous execution)
- [DISPATCH_BLOCK_ENFORCE_QOS_CLASS](dispatch_block_flags_t/dispatch_block_enforce_qos_class.md) (default for synchronous execution)

If the returned dispatch block is submitted directly to a serial queue and is configured to execute with a specific QoS class, the system makes a best effort to apply the necessary QoS overrides to ensure that blocks submitted earlier to the serial queue are executed at that same QoS class or higher.

See [dispatch_block_flags_t](dispatch_block_flags_t.md) for more information.
