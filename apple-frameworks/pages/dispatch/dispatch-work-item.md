- [dispatch_block_create_with_qos_class](dispatch_block_create_with_qos_class.md): Creates a new dispatch block from an existing block and the given flags, and assigns it the specified quality-of-service class and relative priority.
- [dispatch_block_t](dispatch_block_t.md): The prototype of blocks submitted to dispatch queues, which take no arguments and have no return value.
- [dispatch_block_flags_t](dispatch_block_flags_t.md): Flags to pass to the [dispatch_block_create](dispatch_block_create.md) and [dispatch_block_create_with_qos_class](dispatch_block_create_with_qos_class.md) functions.

### Scheduling Work Items

- [dispatch_block_perform](dispatch_block_perform.md): Creates, synchronously executes, and releases a dispatch block from the specified block and flags.

### Adding a Completion Handler

- [dispatch_block_notify](dispatch_block_notify.md): Schedules a notification block to be submitted to a queue when the execution of a specified dispatch block has completed.

### Delaying Execution of a Work Item

- [dispatch_block_wait](dispatch_block_wait.md): Waits synchronously until execution of the specified dispatch block has completed or until the specified timeout has elapsed.

### Canceling a Work Item

- [dispatch_block_cancel](dispatch_block_cancel.md): Cancels the specified dispatch block asynchronously.
- [dispatch_block_testcancel](dispatch_block_testcancel.md): Tests whether the given dispatch block has been canceled.
