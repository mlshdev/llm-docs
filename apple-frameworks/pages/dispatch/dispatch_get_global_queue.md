# dispatch_get_global_queue

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** Dispatch  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** iOS 4.0+ · iPadOS 4.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.6+ · tvOS · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

Returns a system-defined global concurrent queue with the specified quality-of-service class.

## Declaration

```objectivec
extern dispatch_queue_global_tdispatch_get_global_queue(intptr_t identifier, uintptr_t flags);
```

## Parameters

- `identifier`: The quality of service you want to give to tasks executed using this queue. Quality-of-service helps determine the priority given to tasks executed by the queue. You may specify the values `QOS_CLASS_USER_INTERACTIVE`, `QOS_CLASS_USER_INITIATED`, `QOS_CLASS_UTILITY`, or `QOS_CLASS_BACKGROUND`. Queues that handle user-interactive or user-initiated tasks have a higher priority than tasks meant to run in the background.

  In OS X 10.9 or earlier, you can specify one of the dispatch queue priority values, which are found in [dispatch_queue_priority_t](dispatch_queue_priority_t.md). These values map to an appropriate quality-of-service class.
- `flags`: Flags that are reserved for future use. Always specify `0` for this parameter.

The requested global concurrent queue.

## Discussion

This function returns a queue suitable for executing tasks with the specified quality-of-service level. Calls to the [dispatch_suspend](dispatchobject/suspend%28%29.md), [dispatch_resume](dispatchobject/resume%28%29.md), and [dispatch_set_context](dispatch_set_context.md) functions have no effect on the returned queues.

Tasks submitted to the returned queue are scheduled concurrently with respect to one another.
