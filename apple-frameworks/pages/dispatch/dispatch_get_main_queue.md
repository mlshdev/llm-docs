## Discussion

The system automatically creates the main queue and associates it with your application’s main thread. Your app uses one (and only one) of the following three approaches to invoke blocks submitted to the main queue:

- Calling [dispatch_main](dispatchmain%28%29.md)
- Calling [UIApplicationMain](../uikit/uiapplicationmain%28________%29-1yub7.md) (iOS) or [NSApplicationMain(\_:\_:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsapplicationmain%28_:_:%29) (macOS)
- Using a [CFRunLoopRef](../corefoundation/cfrunloop.md) on the main thread

As with the global concurrent queues, calls to [dispatch_suspend](dispatchobject/suspend%28%29.md), [dispatch_resume](dispatchobject/resume%28%29.md), [dispatch_set_context](dispatch_set_context.md), and the like have no effect when used with queues returned by this function.
