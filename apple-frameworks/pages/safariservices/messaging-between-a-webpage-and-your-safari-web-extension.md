# Messaging between a webpage and your Safari web extension

**Interface languages:** Swift, Objective-C

**Framework:** Safari Services  
**Kind:** Article

Configure your extension to enable messaging from webpages, and then update your extension to handle messages.

## Overview

With messaging, you can allow a webpage to control features in your extension based on events or data, or you can allow a webpage to request and use data from your extension.

First, configure your web extension to receive messages from a list of webpages that you specify. Then, add functionality to handle messages that a webpage sends to your extension, and respond to that webpage.

### Enable messaging from webpages in your manifest

To enable messaging from webpages, add `externally_connectable` to your extension’s `manifest.json` file. Include a list of webpages that you want to send messages to your extension in the `matches` attribute.

```javascript
{ 
    "externally_connectable": {
        "matches": [ "*://*.apple.com/*" ]
    }
}
```

If you don’t provide the `matches` attribute or you provide an empty list, no webpages can send messages to your extension.

### Send messages from a webpage to your extension

Send a message from a webpage to your extension using `browser.runtime.sendMessage`. Provide your extension’s identifier, the message data, and a closure to handle the response from your extension.

```javascript
browser.runtime.sendMessage("com.example.connectable-ext.Extension (team_identifier)", {greeting: "Hello!"}, function(response) {
    console.log("Received response from the background page:");
    console.log(response.farewell);
});
```

Your extension’s identifier is a string that consists of the bundle identifier for your extension, and your team identifier in parentheses. Find your team identifier in your [developer account](https://developer.apple.com/programs/) in the Membership tab under Account Settings. Note that extension identifiers can be different across browsers. For more information about finding the right extension identifier for Safari, see [What’s new in Safari web extensions](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10099/).

In your extension’s background page, listen for incoming messages webpages and send responses.

```javascript
browser.runtime.onMessageExternal.addListener(function(message, sender, sendResponse) {
    console.log("Received message from the sender:");
    console.log(message.greeting);
    sendResponse({farewell: "Goodbye from the background page!"});
});
```

### Set up a port for messages between a webpage and your extension

If your extension needs to handle more continuous data from a webpage, establish a port connection between the webpage and your extension.

```javascript
let port = browser.runtime.connect("extensionID");
```

In your extension’s background page, listen for incoming port connection requests.

```javascript
browser.runtime.onConnectExternal.addListener(function(port) {
    console.log("Connection request received!");
});
```

Then, use `port.postMessage` to send a message through the port, and `port.onMessage` to receive a message from the port.
