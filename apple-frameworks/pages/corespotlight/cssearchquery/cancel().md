## Discussion

Cancel a query operation when you no longer need the results. You can use this method to cancel a query you started, by using either the [start()](start%28%29.md) method or by accessing the [results](results-swift.property.md) property. After you cancel a query operation, you can’t restart it. To perform a new query, create a new query object. For example, you might cancel one query and start a new one when the text in your app’s search control changes.
