## Discussion

The Spotlight search tool provides several ways to search content, and implements each technique as an independent stage. For a given query, a model can run multiple stages to generate the results of the query. Use this property to associate search reply structures with a specific stage. The token itself is an opaque value you save and compare against tokens in other search replies. You might use this value to partition the data you receive.
