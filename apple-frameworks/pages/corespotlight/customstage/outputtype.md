## Discussion

Specify the type of data your custom stage supports. In the implementation of your type’s `execute` methods, generate a [SearchPipelineData](../searchpipelinedata.md) structure with the type of data you specified in this property.

The model considers your stage’s input types, output type, and other factors when determining whether to include the stage in a pipeline. When constructing the pipeline, the system maps the output from one stage to the input of the next.
