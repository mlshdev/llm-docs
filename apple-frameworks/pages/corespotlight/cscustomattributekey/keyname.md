# keyName (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Spotlight  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 9.0+ · iPadOS 9.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.11+ · visionOS 1.0+

The name of the custom attribute key.

## Declaration

```swift
var keyName: String { get }
```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

The key name is a string that contains only ASCII characters and no punctuation other than the underscore (that is “\_”). The prefix `kMD` is reserved. To create a custom attribute key name, it’s recommended that you use a reverse DNS format that includes your company name and does not include the period character (”.”). For example, a key name of the form `com_mycompany_myapp_mykeyname` works well.

- [isSearchableByDefault](issearchablebydefault.md): A Boolean value that indicates if the custom attribute should be searchable by default.
