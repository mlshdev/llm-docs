## Discussion

Call this method to request that the host creates a new window where your plug-in displays custom-user interface elements. The maximum window size is limited to 80% of the host application’s main window size. The reply block returns the window for your custom view.

If there are any problems creating the window, `parentView` is `nil` and `error` contains an NSError that describes the problem.

> **Note**

> Each plug-in instance is limited to a single window. If a user doesn’t close the window that contains the custom-user interface elements, subsequent calls to this method return the same parent view.
