# collections (Swift)

**Framework:** Media Player  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 3.0+ · iPadOS 3.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · visionOS 1.0+

An array of media item collections whose contained items match the query’s media property predicate.

## Declaration

```swift
var collections: [MPMediaItemCollection]? { get }
```

## Discussion

The system groups and sorts the returned array of collections by the `groupingType` of the media query. The following code listing demonstrates how to use this property:

**Swift**

```swift
// Specify a media query. This one matches the entire library because it
// doesn't contain a media property predicate.
let everything = MPMediaQuery()
 
// Configure the media query to group its media items; here, grouped by artist.
everything.groupingType = MPMediaGrouping.artist
 
// Obtain the media item collections from the query.
let collections = [everything]
```

**Objective-C**

```objc
// Specify a media query. This one matches the entire library because it
// doesn't contain a media property predicate.
MPMediaQuery *everything = [[MPMediaQuery alloc] init];
 
// Configure the media query to group its media items; here, grouped by artist.
[everything setGroupingType: MPMediaGroupingArtist];
 
// Obtain the media item collections from the query.
NSArray *collections = [everything collections];
```

Each element of the `collections` array now contains a media item collection. Each collection contains the media items from the library by a particular artist. The system sorts elements of the array by the artist name.

For the available grouping types, see [MPMediaGrouping](../mpmediagrouping.md).
