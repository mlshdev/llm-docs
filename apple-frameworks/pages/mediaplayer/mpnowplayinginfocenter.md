# MPNowPlayingInfoCenter (Swift)

**Framework:** Media Player  
**Kind:** Class  
**Availability:** iOS 5.0+ · iPadOS 5.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.12.2+ · tvOS 5.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 5.0+

An object for setting the Now Playing information for media that your app plays.

## Declaration

```swift
class MPNowPlayingInfoCenter
```

## Mentioned In

- [Providing animated artwork for media items](providing-animated-artwork-for-media-items.md)

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

If your app also provides Now Playing information containing information about the current track, use this object to update that information at appropriate times. This object contains a [nowPlayingInfo](mpnowplayinginfocenter/nowplayinginfo.md) dictionary describing the playing item.

> **Important**

>  Siri can provide suggestions in search, News, Safari, and other apps using on-device information that you contribute through the Now Playing APIs. Users can control Siri on-device learning through Siri and Search settings for your app.

The system displays Now Playing information on the device’s Lock Screen and in the media controls in Control Center. If the user directs playback of your media to Apple TV using AirPlay, the Now Playing information appears on the television screen. If the user connects a device to an iPod accessory, such as in a car, the accessory may display Now Playing information.

> **Important**

>  To ensure that your app interacts successfully with the widest possible range of accessories, provide values for as many information properties as you can in the [nowPlayingInfo](mpnowplayinginfocenter/nowplayinginfo.md) dictionary.

The information you can specify includes all of the Now Playing metadata properties (see the Accessing Now Playing metadata properties topic group below), and the following subset of [MPMediaItem](mpmediaitem.md) properties:

- [MPMediaItemPropertyAlbumTitle](mpmediaitempropertyalbumtitle.md)
- [MPMediaItemPropertyAlbumTrackCount](mpmediaitempropertyalbumtrackcount.md)
- [MPMediaItemPropertyAlbumTrackNumber](mpmediaitempropertyalbumtracknumber.md)
- [MPMediaItemPropertyArtist](mpmediaitempropertyartist.md)
- [MPMediaItemPropertyArtwork](mpmediaitempropertyartwork.md)
- [MPMediaItemPropertyComposer](mpmediaitempropertycomposer.md)
- [MPMediaItemPropertyDiscCount](mpmediaitempropertydisccount.md)
- [MPMediaItemPropertyDiscNumber](mpmediaitempropertydiscnumber.md)
- [MPMediaItemPropertyGenre](mpmediaitempropertygenre.md)
- [MPMediaItemPropertyMediaType](mpmediaitempropertymediatype.md)
- [MPMediaItemPropertyPersistentID](mpmediaitempropertypersistentid.md)
- [MPMediaItemPropertyPlaybackDuration](mpmediaitempropertyplaybackduration.md)
- [MPMediaItemPropertyTitle](mpmediaitempropertytitle.md)

You don’t have direct control over what information the system displays, or its formatting. You set the values in the [nowPlayingInfo](mpnowplayinginfocenter/nowplayinginfo.md) dictionary and the system or the connected accessory handles displaying the information in a consistent manner for all apps.

You can ensure that your app interacts well with other apps providing Now Playing information by following the best practices in the [Becoming a now playable app](becoming-a-now-playable-app.md) sample code project.

> **Important**

>  In iOS 17.2 and later, the Journal app encourages people to reflect and write about their day-to-day experiences, including media they listened to or watched. If your app donates media information to [MPNowPlayingInfoCenter](mpnowplayinginfocenter.md), and you choose not to opt-out, the media played may appear as a suggestion in the Journal app, or other apps that use the Journaling Suggestions framework.
