## Discussion

Marker-only sample buffers are meant to carry attachments that communicate a state change between sample buffers. To set attachments on the sample buffer please to access the underlying sample buffer instance as follows:

```swift
markerOnlySampleBuffer.withUnsafeSampleBuffer { sbuf in
    sbuf.attachments[.endsPreviousSampleDuration] = .shouldPropagate(true)
}
```
