# setOutputPresentationTimeStamp(\_:)

**Framework:** Core Media  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 13.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 6.0+

Sets an output presentation timestamp to use in place of a calculated value.

## Declaration

```swift
func setOutputPresentationTimeStamp(_ pts: CMTime) throws
```

## Parameters

- `pts`: The output presentation timestamp.

## Discussion

This value is the time at which the system should present the decoded, trimmed, stretched and possibly reversed samples. By default, retrieving the value of the `outputPresentationTimeStamp` property calculates the time dynamically. You can use this method to set a specific value for `outputPresentationTimeStamp`.

For general forward playback in a scaled edit, calculate the timestamp as follows:

`((PresentationTimeStamp + TrimDurationAtStart - EditStartMediaTime) / EditSpeedMultiplier) + EditStartTrackTime`

For general reversed playback, calculate the timestamp as shown below:

`((PresentationTimeStamp + Duration - TrimDurationAtEnd - EditStartMediaTime) / EditSpeedMultiplier) + EditStartTrackTime`
