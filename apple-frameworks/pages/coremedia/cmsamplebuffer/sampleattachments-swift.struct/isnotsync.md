## Discussion

Set the value to true for samples which should not be treated as sync samples.

A sync sample, also known as a key frame or IDR (Instantaneous Decoding Refresh), can be decoded without requiring any previous samples to have been decoded. Samples following a sync sample also do not require samples prior to the sync sample to have been decoded. Samples are assumed to be sync samples by default.
