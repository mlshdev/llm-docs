# kCMSampleBufferAttachmentKey_TrimDurationAtStart (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Media  
**Kind:** Global Variable  
**Availability:** iOS 4.0+ · iPadOS 4.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.7+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 6.0+

The duration that should be removed at the beginning of the sample buffer, after decoding.

## Declaration

```swift
let kCMSampleBufferAttachmentKey_TrimDurationAtStart: CFString
```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

If this attachment is not present, the trim duration is zero (nothing removed).        This is a [CMTime](cmtime.md) in Core Foundation dictionary format as made by [CMTimeCopyAsDictionary(\_:allocator:)](cmtimecopyasdictionary%28__allocator_%29.md);         use [CMTimeMakeFromDictionary(\_:)](cmtimemakefromdictionary%28__%29.md) to convert to [CMTime](cmtime.md).        In cases where all the output after decoding the sample buffer is to be discarded         (for example, the samples are only being decoded to prime the decoder) the usual convention        is to set [kCMSampleBufferAttachmentKey_TrimDurationAtStart](kcmsamplebufferattachmentkey_trimdurationatstart.md) to the whole duration         and not to set a [kCMSampleBufferAttachmentKey_TrimDurationAtEnd](kcmsamplebufferattachmentkey_trimdurationatend.md) attachment.

### Sample Buffer Keys

- [kCMSampleBufferAttachmentKey_DisplayEmptyMediaImmediately](kcmsamplebufferattachmentkey_displayemptymediaimmediately.md): Tells that the empty marker should be dequeued immediately regardless of its timestamp (type `CFBoolean`, default false).
- [kCMSampleBufferAttachmentKey_DrainAfterDecoding](kcmsamplebufferattachmentkey_drainafterdecoding.md): Indicates whether the sample buffer should be drained after decoding type `CFBoolean`, default false).

- [kCMSampleBufferDroppedFrameReason_FrameWasLate](kcmsamplebufferdroppedframereason_framewaslate.md): The frame was dropped because it was late.
- [kCMSampleBufferDroppedFrameReason_OutOfBuffers](kcmsamplebufferdroppedframereason_outofbuffers.md): The frame was dropped because the module providing frames is out of buffers.

- [kCMSampleBufferAttachmentKey_PostNotificationWhenConsumed](kcmsamplebufferattachmentkey_postnotificationwhenconsumed.md): If present, indicates that decode pipelines should post a notification when consuming the sample buffer(type `CFDictionary`).
