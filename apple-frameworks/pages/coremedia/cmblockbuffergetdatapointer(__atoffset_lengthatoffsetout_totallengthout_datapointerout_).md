# CMBlockBufferGetDataPointer(\_:atOffset:lengthAtOffsetOut:totalLengthOut:dataPointerOut:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Core Media  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** iOS 4.0+ · iPadOS 4.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.7+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 6.0+

Gains access to the data represented by a block buffer.

## Declaration

```swift
func CMBlockBufferGetDataPointer(_ theBuffer: CMBlockBuffer, atOffset offset: Int, lengthAtOffsetOut: UnsafeMutablePointer<Int>?, totalLengthOut: UnsafeMutablePointer<Int>?, dataPointerOut: UnsafeMutablePointer<UnsafeMutablePointer<CChar>?>?) -> OSStatus
```

## Parameters

- `theBuffer`: `CMBlockBuffer` to operate on. Must not be `NULL`
- `offset`: Offset within the buffer’s offset range.
- `lengthAtOffsetOut`: On return, contains the amount of data available at the specified offset. May be `NULL`.
- `totalLengthOut`: On return, contains the block buffer’s total data length (from offset 0). May be `NULL`.
- `dataPointerOut`: On return, contains a pointer to the data byte at the specified offset; `lengthAtOffset` bytes are available at this address. May be `NULL`.

## Return Value

Returns `kCMBlockBufferNoErr` if data was accessible at the specified offset within the given `CMBlockBuffer`. Returns an error otherwise.

## Discussion

Gains access to the data represented by a [CMBlockBuffer](cmblockbuffer.md). A pointer into a memory block is returned which corresponds to the offset within the `CMBlockBuffer`.  If `lengthAtOffset` is non `NULL`, the number of bytes addressable at the pointer is returned. This length-at-offset may be smaller than the number of bytes actually available starting at the offset if the `dataLength` of the `CMBlockBuffer` is covered by multiple memory blocks (a noncontiguous `CMBlockBuffer`). The caller can compare (`offset`+`lengthAtOffset`) with `totalLength` to determine whether the entire `CMBlockBuffer` has been referenced and whether it is possible to access the `CMBlockBuffer`’s data with a contiguous reference. The data pointer returned will remain valid as long as the original `CMBlockBuffer` is referenced - once the `CMBlockBuffer` is released for the last time, any pointers                into it will be invalid.
