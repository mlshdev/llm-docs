# WidgetFamily

**Framework:** WidgetKit  
**Kind:** Enumeration  
**Availability:** iOS 14.0+ · iPadOS 14.0+ · Mac Catalyst 14.0+ · macOS 11.0+ · visionOS 26.0+ · watchOS 9.0+

Values that define the widget’s size and shape.

## Declaration

```swift
@preconcurrency enum WidgetFamily
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Widgets can support one or more sizes, giving users the flexibility to configure their widgets however they like. Each widget size provides a different amount of space for detail, so consider which sizes work best for the type of information the widget displays. For more information about designing widgets, see [Widgets](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/widgets/overview/introduction/) or [Complications](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/watchos/overview/complications/).

> **Note**

> The sizes of widgets may vary across devices. Your widget content should be flexible and avoid using fixed values.

You specify the sizes your widget supports using the [supportedFamilies(\_:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/widgetconfiguration/supportedfamilies%28_:%29) property modifier when defining your widget’s configuration.

```swift
struct GameStatusWidget: Widget {
    var body: some WidgetConfiguration {
        StaticConfiguration(
            kind: "com.mygame.game-status",
            provider: GameStatusProvider(),
            placeholder: GameStatusPlaceholderView()
        ) { entry in
            GameStatusView(entry.gameStatus)
        }
        .configurationDisplayName("Game Status")
        .description("Shows an overview of your game status")
        .supportedFamilies([.systemSmall, .systemMedium, .systemLarge])
    }
}
```

When WidgetKit needs to load a widget’s timeline, it calls the [TimelineProvider](timelineprovider.md) class’s [getTimeline(in:completion:)](timelineprovider/gettimeline%28in_completion_%29.md) method. The system passes a [TimelineProviderContext](timelineprovidercontext.md) instance to the method’s `context` parameter. Use the context’s [family](timelineprovidercontext/family.md) property to determine the widget’s size and shape. For example, the [WidgetFamily.systemSmall](widgetfamily/systemsmall.md) family represents a small, square widget on the Home Screen or Today View in iOS or iPadOS, while, in watchOS the[WidgetFamily.accessoryCorner](widgetfamily/accessorycorner.md) family appears as a widget-based complication in the corner of a watch face.

Use the [WidgetFamily](widgetfamily.md) value to return the appropriate content given the widget’s size. For example, a [WidgetFamily.systemSmall](widgetfamily/systemsmall.md) widget may focus on showing only the most critical data, such as a single image or a simple gauge, while a [WidgetFamily.systemLarge](widgetfamily/systemlarge.md) widget can contain additional details, more-complex graphs, and even small blocks of text.

## Topics

### Accessing system families

- [WidgetFamily.systemMedium](widgetfamily/systemmedium.md): A medium-sized widget.
- [WidgetFamily.systemLarge](widgetfamily/systemlarge.md): A large widget.
- [WidgetFamily.systemExtraLarge](widgetfamily/systemextralarge.md): An extra-large widget.
- [WidgetFamily.systemExtraLargePortrait](widgetfamily/systemextralargeportrait.md): An extra-large widget that uses a portrait orientation.

### Accessing accessory families

- [WidgetFamily.accessoryCircular](widgetfamily/accessorycircular.md): A circular widget.
- [WidgetFamily.accessoryCorner](widgetfamily/accessorycorner.md): A widget-based complication in the corner of a watch face in watchOS.
- [WidgetFamily.accessoryRectangular](widgetfamily/accessoryrectangular.md): A rectangular widget.
- [WidgetFamily.accessoryInline](widgetfamily/accessoryinline.md): A flat widget that contains a single row of text and an optional image.
