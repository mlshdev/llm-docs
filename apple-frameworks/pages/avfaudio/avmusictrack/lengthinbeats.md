# lengthInBeats (Swift)

**Framework:** AVFAudio  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 9.0+ · iPadOS 9.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.11+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

The total duration of the track, in beats.

```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

This property returns the beat of the last event in the track, plus any additional time that’s necessary to fade out the ending notes, or to round a loop point to a musical bar.

If the user doesn’t set this value, the track length always adjusts to the end of the last active event in a track, and adjusts dynamically as the user adds or removes events.

This property returns the maximum of the user-set track length or the calculated length.

## See Also

### Configuring the Track Duration

- [lengthInSeconds](lengthinseconds.md): The total duration of the track, in seconds.
