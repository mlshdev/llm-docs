## Discussion

To resume using audio after an interruption ends, you must ensure that your audio session is active. [AVAudioPlayer](../avaudioplayer.md) and [AVAudioRecorder](../avaudiorecorder.md) instances reactivate your audio session automatically when an interruption ends. If you are using another audio technology, such as OpenAL, audio units, or audio queues, you must reactivate your audio session yourself before you can again use audio.

You can also use this method to update the user interface and application state, as necessary.

If this delegate method receives the [AVAudioSessionInterruptionFlags_ShouldResume](../avaudiosessioninterruptionflags_shouldresume.md) constant in its `flags` parameter, the audio session is immediately ready to be used.

If you implement this method, it is called instead of the [endInterruption()](endinterruption%28%29.md) method when an interruption ends.
