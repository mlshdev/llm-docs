## Discussion

Personalization lets the view controller offer support for incorporating people into the images it generates. When enabled, the view controller allows someone to build images that include:

- A person from their Photos library
- A character represented by an appearance and a skin tone

When enabled, the view controller offers a way to import an image of a person from the Photos library. It also supports choosing someone from a people picker, and by detecting names in any input text and using that information to find images.

The default value of this property is [ImagePlaygroundPersonalizationPolicy.automatic](../imageplaygroundpersonalizationpolicy/automatic.md), which corresponds to [ImagePlaygroundPersonalizationPolicy.enabled](../imageplaygroundpersonalizationpolicy/enabled.md).
