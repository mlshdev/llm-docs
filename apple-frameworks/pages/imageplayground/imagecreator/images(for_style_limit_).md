# images(for:style:limit:)

**Framework:** Image Playground  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 18.4+ (deprecated in 27.0) · iPadOS 18.4+ (deprecated in 27.0) · Mac Catalyst 18.4+ (deprecated in 27.0) · macOS 15.4+ (deprecated in 27.0) · visionOS 2.4+ (deprecated in 27.0)

Starts the creation of images based on the description and style information you provide.

## Declaration

```swift
final func images(for concepts: [ImagePlaygroundConcept], style: ImagePlaygroundStyle, limit: Int) -> some AsyncSequence<ImageCreator.CreatedImage, any Error>

```

## Parameters

- `concepts`: The elements that describe the expected contents of the image.
- `style`: The style you want the model to apply to the output image. It is a programmer error to specify a style that’s not in the `availableStyles` property.
- `limit`: The maximum number of images you want the system to create. The system limits the maximum number of images to 4.

## Discussion

Call this method to start the image generation process with the specified parameters. The method executes asynchronously and returns the images on the provided [AsyncSequence](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/asyncsequence) object. The following example configures an image creator, starts the creation of the images, and processes the generated images as they arrive.

```swift
do {
    let creator = try await ImageCreator()
    guard let style = creator.availableStyles.first else { return }

    let images = creator.images(
        for: [.text("A cat wearing mittens.")]
        style: style,
        limit: 4)

    // Receive the images.
    for try await image in images {
        let anImage = image.cgImage

        // Do something with the image.
    }
}
catch ImageCreator.Error.notSupported {
    print(“Image creation not supported on the current device.”)
}
```
