# parallaxFactor (Swift)

**Framework:** TVUIKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** tvOS 13.0+

A value that specifies how slowly the background should move relative to the foreground.

## Declaration

```swift
var parallaxFactor: CGFloat { get set }
```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

A large `parallaxFactor` value causes the background to move more slowly compared to the foreground. A small value makes the foreground and background move at a similar pace. The parallax effect becomes more apparent as the value of `parallaxFactor` increases.

The default value of this property is 0.8. The minimum value is 0.0.

- [isTransitioningToCenterIndexPath](istransitioningtocenterindexpath.md): A Boolean value that indicates whether the cell is changing index paths.
