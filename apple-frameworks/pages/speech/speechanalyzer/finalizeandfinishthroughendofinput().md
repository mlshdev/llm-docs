# finalizeAndFinishThroughEndOfInput()

**Framework:** Speech  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 26.0+ · iPadOS 26.0+ · Mac Catalyst 26.0+ · macOS 26.0+ · tvOS 26.0+ · visionOS 26.0+

Finishes analysis after an audio input sequence has been terminated and fully consumed and the modules’ results are finalized.

## Declaration

```swift
final func finalizeAndFinishThroughEndOfInput() async throws
```

## Discussion

This method waits until the input sequence has been terminated and fully consumed, then finalizes like [finalize(through:)](finalize%28through_%29.md) and finishes analysis like [finish(after:)](finish%28after_%29.md).

If there is no input sequence, this method waits until there is an input sequence and the sequence terminates. If the input sequence is replaced using one of the `start` methods, this method continues waiting for the replacement input sequence to terminate.

This method is primarily useful for autonomous analysis started via one of the `start` methods or a similar initializer.

> **Throws**

> `CancellationError` if analysis is finished early before the end of input

- [cancelAndFinishNow()](cancelandfinishnow%28%29.md): Finishes analysis immediately.
- [finalizeAndFinish(through:)](finalizeandfinish%28through_%29.md): Finishes analysis after finalizing results for a given time-code.
- [finish(after:)](finish%28after_%29.md): Finishes analysis once input for a given time is consumed.
