## Discussion

This method is useful in live-audio cases where you are no longer interested in results predating a certain time. For example, when you are captioning video and the scene changes, you do not need pending captions from the previous scene.

This method can also be used to force “catch-up” if the analyzer is taking too long. By calling [finalize(through:)](finalize%28through_%29.md), you indicate that you will *wait* for pending results. By calling `cancelAnalysis(before:)`, you indicate that you *cannot wait* any longer for certain pending results.

Analysis will continue normally at and after the given time.

If you know in advance that you do not need results for a given range of audio, it is preferable to simply not provide that audio as input.

This is a best-effort cancellation. The implementation may still publish results from before the given time.
