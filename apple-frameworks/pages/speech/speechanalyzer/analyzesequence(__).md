# analyzeSequence(\_:)

**Framework:** Speech  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 26.0+ · iPadOS 26.0+ · Mac Catalyst 26.0+ · macOS 26.0+ · tvOS 26.0+ · visionOS 26.0+

Analyzes an input sequence, returning when the sequence terminates.

## Declaration

```swift
final func analyzeSequence<InputSequence>(_ inputSequence: InputSequence) async throws -> CMTime? where InputSequence : Sendable, InputSequence : AsyncSequence, InputSequence.Element == AnalyzerInput
```

## Parameters

- `inputSequence`: An input sequence to analyze.

## Return Value

The time-code of the last audio sample that was consumed from this or an earlier input sequence, or `nil` if no audio sample has been consumed. You may use this value for the parameter of [finalizeAndFinish(through:)](finalizeandfinish%28through_%29.md) (or other methods).

## Discussion

When this method returns, the last audio consumed from the input sequence may still be undergoing analysis. To wait for the analysis to complete, call another method such as [finalize(through:)](finalize%28through_%29.md) and await its return.

If you cancel the task executing this method, most input sequences will terminate early, causing this method to return early. The method returns the time-code of the last audio sample that was consumed and does not throw `CancellationError`.

### Performing analysis

- [analyzeSequence(from:)](analyzesequence%28from_%29.md): Analyzes an input sequence created from an audio file, returning when the file has been read.
