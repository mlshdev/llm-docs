<a id="Guest-User"></a>

### Guest User

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- Guest User access request might fail if an Apple Vision Pro running visionOS 2.4 beta is paired to a device running iOS 18.3 or earlier.  (140292089)

  **Workaround:** Update both devices to latest versions of visionOS 2.4 beta and iOS 18.4 beta.

<a id="libxml2"></a>

### libxml2

<a id="Deprecations"></a>

#### Deprecations

- The custom allocation API for libxml2 is deprecated starting in macOS Sequoia 15.4, iOS 18.4, tvOS 18.4, visionOS 2.4, and tvOS 18.4.  If this API is not used, no changes are required.  If this API is currently used, make changes to call `malloc()` instead of `xmlMalloc()` or `xmlMallocAtomic()`; call `realloc()` instead of `xmlRealloc()`; call `free()` instead of `xmlFree()` and call `strdup()` instead of `xmlMemStrdup()`.  Stop calling `xmlMemSetup()`, `xmlMemGet()`, `xmlGcMemSetup()` and `xmlGcMemGet()` to set custom allocation functions.  Do not set global variables `xmlMalloc`, `xmlMallocAtomic`, `xmlRealloc`, `xmlFree`, and `xmlMemStrdup`.  Internally, libxml2 and libxslt will now use the system allocator instead of this API, so do not rely on these libraries using the custom allocation API.  (138404994)

(145675333)

<a id="StoreKit"></a>

### StoreKit

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- New StoreKit APIs support [Advanced Commerce API](https://developer.apple.com/in-app-purchase/advanced-commerce-api/) in-app purchases.  (118528943)
- By using the new purchase option API `introductoryOfferEligibility(compactJWS:)`, you can now set a preference for whether an introductory offer should be redeemed during a purchase. This API requires you to sign a payload on your server in order to either apply the offer (even if the customer is not eligible) or block it.  (136152740)
- New properties `appTransactionID`, `originalPlatform`, and `period` are now available in [AppTransaction](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/apptransaction), [Transaction](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/transaction), [Transaction.Offer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/transaction/offer-swift.struct), and [Product.SubscriptionInfo.RenewalInfo](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/product/subscriptioninfo/renewalinfo).  (136395697)
- The `Platform` symbol used by originalPlatform in AppTransaction has been moved to `AppStore.Platform`.  (143632084)
- The introductory offer eligibility preference API in PurchaseOption has been renamed to `introductoryOfferEligibility(compactJWS:)`.  (143905053)
- `watchOS` is removed as an option in the AppStore.Platform API. `watchOS` is now combined with `iOS`.  (145578780)

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: StoreKit APIs might return errors from the StoreKit 2 domain during a purchase.  (144191684)

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- Calling `isEligibleForIntroOffer(for:)` will return false if there is no user account signed in.  (146119524)

  **Workaround:** The user should sign in with their App Store account to request introductory offer eligibility.

<a id="Deprecations"></a>

#### Deprecations

- [Transaction.currentEntitlement(for:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/transaction/currententitlement%28for:%29) is now deprecated. This API returns the latest transaction that entitles the user to a product, which may not include transactions originated for family shared subscriptions. Use the `Transaction.currentEntitlements(for:)` method to get all the transactions that entitle the user to a product.  (138320205)

<a id="SwiftUI"></a>

### SwiftUI

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: A color set by the `tint(_:)` modifier does not override the tint color of buttons in that view’s confirmation dialogs and alerts.  (138774306)
- Fixed: For apps compiled against iOS 18.4 beta, applying `defaultVisibility(.hidden)` to customizable toolbar items does not hide the item by default on iOS.  (139815290)
- Fixed: When NavigationStack or NavigationSplitView content updates, the environment is not invalidated unless properties in the environment have changed.  (139855826)
- Fixed: The `glassBackgroundEffect(.feathered)` is rendered as a black box when applied to content with an implicit stack modifier, such as an overlay or border.   (144412802)
- Fixed: `.onPreferenceChange` modifier’s closure argument is required to be `@Sendable`. This might cause concurrency diagnostics that’s unnecessary if the closure needs to access main actor-isolated values. This particular closure shouldn’t have to be this restrictive.  (145238570)

<a id="System-Calls"></a>

### System Calls

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- fileport_makeport(2) and fileport_makefd(2) are now APIs with manual pages.  (66571768) (FB8270900)
