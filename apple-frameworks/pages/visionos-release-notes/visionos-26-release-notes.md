# visionOS 26 Release Notes

**Kind:** Article

Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

The visionOS 26 SDK provides support for developing apps for Apple Vision Pro devices running visionOS 26. The SDK comes bundled with Xcode 26, available from the Mac App Store. For information on the compatibility requirements for Xcode 26, see [Xcode 26 Release Notes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Xcode-Release-Notes/xcode-26-release-notes).

<a id="AirDrop"></a>

### AirDrop

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: Any 2D video or spatial video received via AirDrop will be saved and opened in the Files app instead of the Photos app.  (152265301)

<a id="AlarmKit"></a>

### AlarmKit

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: Attempting to import AlarmKit for a visionOS Simulator project will fail as this API is not available on AlarmKit.  (152339959)

<a id="App-Store"></a>

### App Store

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- A new Accessibility section has been added to the App Store product pages that highlights accessibility features within apps and games. These Accessibility Nutrition Labels give users a new way to learn if an app will be accessible to them before they download it, and give developers the opportunity to better inform and educate their users on features their app supports.  (138344118)

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: `iphone-performance-gaming-tier` apps on visionOS are not available via TestFlight.  (141472382)

<a id="Apple-Intelligence"></a>

### Apple Intelligence

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- The Foundation Models framework provides you with direct access to the on-device large language model at the core of Apple Intelligence. For release notes about the framework, see the Foundation Models framework section below.  (139996377)

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: In Image Playground and Genmoji, the new modifiers to customize appearance do not work for Japanese-language users. Image creation is blocked when attempting to add modifiers to its appearance.  (151833204)
- Fixed: Model quality output degrades after extended, repeated inferences of the same adapter.  (152468267)

<a id="Apple-Vision-Pro-Setup"></a>

### Apple Vision Pro Setup

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: iCloud syncing for Apple Vision Pro Setup data is not enabled by default on Apple Vision Pro and iOS devices.  (153339405)

<a id="Apps"></a>

### Apps

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- visionOS app icons might appear with unexpected shapes and highlights in various places across the system.  (154683810)

<a id="ARKit"></a>

### ARKit

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- The `isTracked` property on hand joints now has an adjusted sensibility and might return `false` under poor lighting conditions or when occluded. However, ARKit will still return a plausible transform for that joint. Check for `isTracked` when high accuracy of the transform is required. It is not recommended to check for this property in use cases which need to work even when some joints are occluded, such as custom hand gesture implementations.  (152100522)

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: Accessory Tracking does not work in Travel Mode. The user might not get notified of this behavior for some connected accessories.  (152264297)
- Fixed: The C API is unavailable on macOS, which limits rendering spatial macOS applications to a Swift implementation.  (152269768)
- Fixed: For Accessory Tracking, the “grip” POI (Point of Interest) for GCController is missing a rotation.  (152304770)
- Fixed: For Accessory Tracking, in order to get the aim POI (Point of Interest) for GCStylus, use the string “tip” in place of “aim”.  (152335557)
- Fixed: ARKit now updates data providers to their new states individually. As a result, the `ARKitSession.Event.dataProviderStateChanged` event might be called more often.  (152665341)
- Fixed: Addressed an issue, where you may have received inaccurate hands data, if you query hand anchors using `HandTrackingProvider.handAnchors(at:)` with timestamps too far in the past or future.  (153125027)
- Fixed: The implementation of `ar_accessory_tracking_provider_get_latest_anchors` retains returned memory, which contradicts the stated documentation.

  Ensure the application code using this function adheres to the existing documentation and is rebuilt against the latest SDK release.  (154337356)
- Fixed: In visionOS 26 beta 4, accessory tracking fails and controllers are not recognized as spatial input devices.  (156458710)

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- Anchor removal notifications do not surface for `AccessoryTrackingProvider`s that listen for `anchorUpdates` when spatial accessories are disconnected or turned off. Apps that depend on removal notifications for removing on-screen visualizations and updating application state might continue to show outdated content when Vision Pro is put back on.  (155822320)

  **Workaround:** Apps still receive the `GCControllerDidDisconnect` and `GCStylusDidDisconnect` notifications when resuming use of Apple Vision Pro and can use them to reset state.

<a id="Deprecations"></a>

#### Deprecations

- `ARQuickLookPreviewItem.h` has been moved to the Quicklook framework and is no longer available via ARKit. If your code imports `ARKit/ARQuickLookPreviewItem.h` directly, change it to import `QuickLook/QuickLook.h` instead. Swift clients should import Quicklook instead of ARKit.  (152081500)
- `NSEnterpriseMCAMUsageDescription` is now deprecated. Use `NSMainCameraUsageDescription` instead.  (152098891)

<a id="AssistantSchemas"></a>

### AssistantSchemas

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: If you have adopted any of the following email AssistantSchemas, you will experience a compilation error due to a parameter type change: `createDraft`, `updateDraft`, `replyMail`, `forwardMail`, `message`, and `draft`.  (148633307)

<a id="AVFoundation"></a>

### AVFoundation

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: `AVPlayerLayer` does not ensure a valid video frame is always displayed during item replacement, as the `isReadyForDisplay` property does not remain true during transitions.  (151902458)

<a id="AVKit"></a>

### AVKit

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: When using the AVPlayerViewController API, Dynamic Mask is not supported in visionOS simulator.  (152602013)

<a id="Background-Assets"></a>

### Background Assets

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: The system might not update downloaded asset packs as frequently as is expected for apps that internal testers install from TestFlight.  (143281558)
- Fixed: Asset pack downloads might fail unexpectedly or stall indefinitely, including across reboots.  (151498902)
- Fixed: The system might not deliver status updates to your app for ongoing asset pack downloads.  (151647839)
- Fixed: Pausing and resuming an app installation or update while the system is downloading essential asset packs might cause the installation or update to stall indefinitely.  (151942388)
- Fixed: The installation of large asset packs might fail.  (153128086)
- Fixed: The URL Override setting doesn’t save an entered URL’s port number. The device always attempts to communicate with the mock server over port 443.  (156113742) (FB18913475)

<a id="CloudKit"></a>

### CloudKit

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: CloudKit sharing URLs do not launch third-party apps.  (151778655)

<a id="CompositorServices"></a>

### CompositorServices

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: When turning off hover effects using the tracking areas API, spatial events might provide an incorrect location.  (151504311)
- Fixed: Immersive Spaces using CompositorServices with the Progressive style do not display correctly on the visionOS simulator.  (151925874)
- Fixed: CompositorServices API hover effects and tracking areas do not work in the visionOS simulator.  (152101959)
- Fixed: When opening an immersive space, there might be a delay before the system has the correct immersion style. This might cause errors for functions that require specific immersion styles, since they may be called before the selected immersion style is propagated.  (152523347)

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- Partially-occluded objects might be more difficult to target with tracking areas compared to RealityKit colliders.  (149224443)
- For CompositorServices renderers using a shared layout, hover effects might not work on tracking areas.  (155811050)

  **Workaround:** Use the layered layout or the dedicated layout with hover effects.
- When using Metal 4 and progressive immersion, calling `cp_drawable_render_context_mtl4_end_encoding` triggers a crash.  (156963664)

  **Workaround:** Set “GPU Frame Capture” in scheme options to “Disabled”.

<a id="Control-Center"></a>

### Control Center

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- Tooltips do not appear for controls in Control Center.  (154219497)

<a id="Controller-Tracking"></a>

### Controller Tracking

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: While using controller tracking, the Hand Tracking API via ARKit still provides updates for hand holding the controller at 1Hz. This means that if an app is using controller tracking and hand tracking at the same time, it will get sporadic hand tracking results. The intended behavior is for hand tracking to stop when controller is held.   (151882645)
- Fixed: User might not be able to close or reposition app windows with a game controller or with hand gestures after using a game controller.  (152673502)

<a id="CoreData"></a>

### CoreData

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: In beta 5 SDK, CoreData changed several `Sendable` annotations to resolve compatibility issues with Swift 6’s new `MainActor` default isolation feature. These changes include marking `NSManagedObject` as `NS_SWIFT_NONISOLATED NS_SWIFT_NONSENDABLE`, marking `NSManagedObjectContext` as `NS_SWIFT_NONISOLATED NS_SWIFT_SENDABLE`, and requiring `NS_SWIFT_SENDABLE` closures for the family of `perform`, `performBlock`, `performBlockAndWait` and similar methods. These changes are ABI compatible with past releases but might introduce new warnings while building source code that violates the longstanding CoreData concurrency guidelines.

  `NSManagedObject` are mutable reference types inextricably related to others in a graph and cannot be made `Sendable`. They are expected to be isolated to the scope of the `NSManagedObjectContext` that creates or fetches them. `NSManagedObjectContext` is a style of actor which encapsulates its own dispatch queue. While it’s impermissible to use many methods on `NSManagedObjectContext` from other threads, it is permissible to pass references around to invoke the `performBlock` family of methods, for the purpose of routing a `Sendable` closure to its managed dispatch queue. CoreData supports a user default `-com.apple.CoreData.ConcurrencyDebug 1` which can be used to enable additional assertions.  (153848710) (FB18216198)

<a id="Deprecations"></a>

#### Deprecations

- This release removes support for the following deprecated `NSPersistentStore` option keys:

  - `NSPersistentStoreUbiquitousContentNameKey`
  - `NSPersistentStoreUbiquitousContentURLKey`
  - `NSPersistentStoreUbiquitousPeerTokenOption`
  - `NSPersistentStoreRemoveUbiquitousMetadataOption`
  - `NSPersistentStoreUbiquitousContainerIdentifierKey`
  - `NSPersistentStoreRebuildFromUbiquitousContentOption`

  These keys have been deprecated for more than a decade. Affected apps rebuilt with the iOS or macOS 26 SDK will get errors. Apps built against older SDKs will log warnings when opening the store.

  The on-device persistent store will be fully usable after these keys are removed from options dictionary, albeit without syncing. For data syncing, these APIs were superseded by `NSPersistentCloudKitContainer` in iOS 13 and SwiftData in iOS 17. If absolutely necessary, the iCloud content remains accessible in the containers with the last baseline as a .zip archive file.  (157297746) (FB19286235)

<a id="EyeSight"></a>

### EyeSight

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: EyeSight might not display content, even if an observer is present.  (155800405)

<a id="FaceTime"></a>

### FaceTime

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- Testing SharePlay experiences in the simulator using FaceTime might cause the simulator to crash.  (153776177)

<a id="Foundation"></a>

### Foundation

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- Interpolating non-localized types into a `LocalizedStringResource/String(localized:)/AttributedString(localized:)` value will now display a deprecation warning instead of potentially falling back to a fully-unlocalized string. Provide a localized value to interpolate into the text instead, or silence the warning by wrapping the unlocalized value in a call to `String(describing:)`.  (126876158)

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: Functions that initialize a string from a C-string pointer do not validate that the provided encoding is a valid encoding for C-strings.  (143756086) (FB16417968)

<a id="Foundation-Models-framework"></a>

### Foundation Models framework

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- `LanguageModelSession.prewarm()` now caches the instructions and prefix of your prompt, in addition to loading system resources. The best place to use `prewarm()` is when your app is waiting for user interactions that might trigger response generation. This will reduce the time to the first-generated token.  (152381043)
- `#Playground` in Xcode now allows for filing feedback for Foundation Models framework responses.  (153770707)
- The `.contentTagging` use case now supports non-English languages. You can query the supported languages using `SystemLanguageModel(useCase: .contentTagging).supportedLanguages`. Tags will be generated based on the language of the prompt.  (155801948)
- When you use guided generation, the framework now supports programmatically detecting when and why the model refuses to respond when the content is not unsafe. In previous beta releases, this manifested as a guardrail violation. Now you can catch a specific error case `LanguageModelSession.GenerationError.refusal` and obtain a model-generated explanation for why it refused to respond. Depending on your use case, you might be able to display the explanation in your UI.  (156086748)
- In `GeneratedContent`, you can use the `isComplete` property to check whether the content was fully generated by the model.  (156109416)
- When using guided generation, you can now access the underlying weakly typed `GeneratedContent` by accessing the `rawContent` property on `Response` or `ResponseStream`.  (156351123)
- New guardrails mode `Guardrails.permissiveContentTransformations` allows transformations of content that might otherwise violate the default guardrails. Use this mode for text-to-text tasks, such as summarization and rewrite.  (156721060)

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: When you pass `includeSchemaInPrompt: false` to `respond` or `streamResponse`, it is not respected.  (151926006)
- Fixed: Custom `@Generable` types named `Number` or `Boolean` might not function reliably in guided generation.  (152280144)
- Fixed: Tool calling might not function properly if primitive types such as `Int`, `String`, or `Bool` are used as the argument.  (152318534)
- Fixed: In an Xcode Playground, requests made to the model might receive a “rate limit exceeded” error.  (152325506)
- Fixed: Model requests in macOS command line tools might experience rate limiting.  (152681332)
- Fixed: Generable types with a recursive definition lead to a `SchemaError` when generating a response.  (153147722) (FB17962270)
- Fixed: A prompt containing Chinese might lead to error “Unsupported language zh-hans detected”.  (153151710) (FB17963656)
- Fixed: `Generable` types cannot be made public due to a bug in the `Generable` macro.  (153216183) (FB17990794)
- Fixed: Requests to the model might experience rate limiting, even when the device is connected to power.  (153216632)
- Fixed: The Foundation Models framework cannot be imported when building for Mac Catalyst.  (153255533) (FB18004324)
- Fixed: Creating a `LanguageModelSession` with tools that have duplicate names leads to a fatal error.  (153426645) (FB18074984)
- Fixed: When using guided generation and tool calling together, some requests might lead to `LanguageModelSession.GenerationError.decodingFailure` due to a bug in constrained decoding.  (153773704) (FB18190120)
- Fixed: When creating a session with a transcript, any new tools you attach to the session might not be used. Additionally, if your transcript contains tools from a previous session, those tools must be passed as the `tools:` argument in the new session in order to function properly.  (154904647)
- Fixed: Some prompts erroneously return an error indicating a guardrail violation `(FoundationModels.LanguageModelSession.GenerationError error 2)`.  (155273863)
- Fixed: When using tool calling with guided generation, tools might not get called.  (155313086) (FB18691470)
- Fixed: Generating an enum with associated values through a dynamic schema crashes with a `SchemaError`.  (155957346) (FB18878026)
- Fixed: In some cases, requests you make to the model erroneously throw a `guardrailViolation` for all prompts due to model assets not fully downloaded.  (156223847) (FB18944619)

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- Some instructions and prompts to the model might not lead to expected responses. Use Feedback Assistant to report satisfactory or unsatisfactory cases. When applicable, you can use `LanguageModelSession.logFeedbackAttachment()` to serialize the feedback to a JSON file and attach it to Feedback Assistant.  (152318091)

  **Workaround:** Refine your instructions and prompts using `#Playground` in Xcode. When applying guided generation with a `@Generable` type, add `@Guide` with a custom description on properties to steer the model’s responses.
- If `Argument` type is an enum with associated type, tools will encounter a `ToolCallError` with an underlying `decodingFailure` when the model attempts to call it.  (156723065)

  **Workaround:** Wrap the enum in a struct.

<a id="Game-Controller"></a>

### Game Controller

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- Pair multiple Apple devices to your DualSense or DualSense Edge controller and easily switch between them directly using the controller or Bluetooth settings. See [this PlayStation blog post](https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/23/new-ps5-system-update-beta-previews-dualsense-wireless-controller-pairing-across-multiple-devices/) for details.  (137782227)

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- You might not be able to reposition app windows with a game controller after playing an Arcade game using controllers.  (152130313)

  **Workaround:** Turn off Bluetooth, turn it on again, and re-connect the controllers.

<a id="HealthKit"></a>

### HealthKit

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: The authorization screen prompted by the Medications Authorization API cannot be dismissed if the user has no available medications needing authorization.  (152094574)

<a id="iCloud"></a>

### iCloud

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: Prescription assets created on visionOS might not sync to iOS.  (152119040)

<a id="Image-Playground"></a>

### Image Playground

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- The UI becomes locked when attempting to interact with the generic person panel noted in popover for bincompat Playground API presentation.  (152095114)

  **Workaround:** Force quit and restart the app.

<a id="ImmersiveSpace"></a>

### ImmersiveSpace

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: Observable view models in an ImmersiveSpace do not get de-initialized when the ImmersiveSpace is closed. Additionally, ImmersiveSpace content is evaluated eagerly instead of lazily.  (147699733)

<a id="iPhone-Unlock"></a>

### iPhone Unlock

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- Unlocking your iPhone with Apple Vision Pro might not work.  (155556946)

  **Workaround:** Update the iPhone to iOS 26 beta 4 or newer and the Apple Vision Pro to visionOS 26 beta 4 or newer.

<a id="Keyboards"></a>

### Keyboards

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- For Chinese, Japanese, and Korean keyboards, expanding and collapsing the candidate bar might cause the bottom row of full-size keyboards and bottom two rows of 10-key keyboards to register the wrong input.  (152120249)

  **Workaround:** Resize the keyboard by dragging the corner.

<a id="Lists"></a>

### Lists

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: For platform-compatible first-party apps like Calendar, Voice Memos, and Reminders, list rows with multi-selection buttons might fail to render those buttons.  (152510946)

<a id="Look-to-Scroll"></a>

### Look to Scroll

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: If Look to Scroll is disabled in Settings and the user has not encountered the feature before, a Tip notification for Look to Scroll will still appear.  (146418079)

<a id="Mac-Virtual-Display"></a>

### Mac Virtual Display

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: Users might see sharp edges around keyboards and MacBooks when viewing in passthrough.  (153668146)

<a id="Maps"></a>

### Maps

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- Curated guides do not scroll on iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS when the iPhone is in landscape mode.  (152123749)

  **Workaround:** On iPhone, view curated guides in portrait mode.

<a id="Memory-Tools"></a>

### Memory Tools

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- Leaks might be falsely reported by memory analysis tools when a target has instances of types that use Obj-C properties implemented in Swift using bridged types with `@objc @implementation`. Memory analysis tools include the `leaks` CLI tool, Leaks instrument, and Xcode memory graph debugger.  (157798911)

<a id="Messages"></a>

### Messages

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: Sent translated messages do not get re-translated after editing.  (149401758)
- Fixed: In regions where Screen Unknown Senders is on by default, notifications for message categories are erroneously off by default.  (149450560)
- Fixed: When scrolling through a conversation that contains messages that failed to send, translucent circles might appear to the right of the transcript, not connected to any message.  (149575551)
- Fixed: In one-to-one conversations, background changes might be attributed incorrectly after quitting and re-opening the Messages app.  (150548773)
- Fixed: When setting a photo as a background in conversations, the photo appears larger than the preview shows.  (151730462)
- Fixed: Transaction or Promotion messages filtered by a Message Filter App Extension might be badged as “Unknown” in the conversation list rather than “Transaction” or “Promotion”.  (151869409)

<a id="Metal"></a>

### Metal

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- Metal 4 is now supported. See [Metal](https://developer.apple.com/metal/) for additional details.  (113781091)

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: If you’re using Metal 4 command encoders, you should add render and compute pipelines that support indirect command buffers to your residency sets. The Metal device driver currently does not enforce this requirement.  (145066238)
- Fixed: Metal Shader Validation might not work with shaders that use Metal Performance Primitives.  (149263281)

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- Metal Shader Validation might not work with Metal 4 ray tracing pipelines.  (152520367)

  **Workaround:** Selectively disable Shader Validation for pipelines using ray tracing. See [documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/validating-your-apps-metal-shader-usage/#Selectively-enable-Shader-Validation).

<a id="MetalFX"></a>

### MetalFX

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: Temporal upscaling for MTL4CommandBuffer’s `MTL4FXTemporalScaler` does not work.  (146436741)

<a id="Mobile-Device-Management"></a>

### Mobile Device Management

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: Apps installed via Declarative Device Management might not get preserved correctly during Rapid Return to Service flow.  (148849851)

<a id="Music"></a>

### Music

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: Switching audio routes during playback of a music video or advancing to the next video in a playlist might cause the Music app to return to the playlist view, stop responding, or close unexpectedly.  (152145901)

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- The Music widget might be unable to display content artwork.  (155628172)

<a id="NetworkExtension"></a>

### NetworkExtension

<a id="Deprecations"></a>

#### Deprecations

- Algorithms DES, 3DES, SHA1-96 and SHA1-160 as well as Diffie-Hellman groups less than 14 are no longer supported for IKEv2 VPNs.  (148767790)

<a id="NSLog"></a>

### NSLog

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- Dynamic string data in format arguments for `NSLog` will be redacted to `\<private\>` in the Unified Logging System. This specifically targets data that enters the Unified Logging System via `NSLog`, and will not impact the Xcode console or `NSLog`’s `stdout` output. If you wish to log un-redacted data to the Unified Logging System please use the “os_log” or “Logger” interfaces.  (137129180)

<a id="Quick-Look"></a>

### Quick Look

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: Opening a side-by-side stereo 180° video on Apple Vision Pro from Files and opting to convert it to Apple Projected Media Profile might stall indefinitely during conversion.   (146349661)

<a id="RealityKit"></a>

### RealityKit

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- SwiftUI modal presentations are now permitted in RealityViewAttachments.  (129033264)
- You can use `PresentationComponent` with `.popover` configuration to show a SwiftUI popover anchored to a RealityKit entity. When presented, the popover will start off billboarded towards the user. To billboard continuously, use a `BillboardComponent` alongside the `PresentationComponent`.  (132603872)

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: Entities with a PortalComponent ignore any ModelSortGroupComponent and instead use a fixed rendering order.

  In case of sorting rendering issues with portal surface, explicitly add a ModelSortGroupComponent using a `.planarUIAlwaysBehind` sort group.  (149899345)
- Fixed: When using RealityKit API to retrieve the transform value of an accessory-anchored entity in a shared space, the result might be offset from its true value.  (151163403)
- Fixed: App will crash if an entity is removed while presenting an `ImagePresentationComponent.Spatial3DImage` that has not yet finished generating.  (151960494)
- Fixed: The `animate` functions on `Entity` and `RealityViewContent` do not start animations.  (152456435)
- Fixed: When using the VideoPlayerComponent API, Dynamic Mask is not supported in the visionOS simulator.  (152725380)

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- Synchronous-loading APIs block the main actor and should not be used in async contexts.  (117170643)

  **Workaround:** Use `init(...)` async instead.
- Simple Views using RealityView that modify a `@State` in the `make` closure and use it only in the `update` closure sometimes read an old value in the `update` closure.  (145771388)

  **Workaround:** Explicitly capture state properties in the `update` closure:

  ```
   struct ContentView: View {
       @State var entity: Entity?

  ```
- Some properties and components do not update SwiftUI Views when accessed through the `.observable` property on Entity.  (147063698)
- When a `PresentationComponent` is created with a `Binding` from an `ObservableObject`’s published property, changes to the property might not result in the popover presenting correctly.  (151346044)
- When using ManipulationComponent with `dynamics.translationBehavior = .none`, `releaseBehavior = .reset` does not reset rotation.  (151648417)

  **Workaround:** Apply rotation after `ManipulationEvents.WillEnd`.
- Windows with solid background colors appear to stutter at the edges of Developer Captures if no other windows are open.  (156968230)

  **Workaround:** Use the default background style, open another window in the background, or keep the window in view at all times during the Developer Capture.

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- When using the RemoteImmersiveSpace API to stream spatial content from Mac to Apple Vision Pro, there might be visual artifacts around objects of high depth disparity, such as near objects overlapping far objects.  (147999474)
- When using the RemoteImmersiveSpace API that streams spatial content from Mac to Apple Vision Pro, visionOS 26 beta 2 and macOS 26 beta 2 are not backwards compatible with visionOS 26 beta 1 and macOS 26 beta 1.  (149579399)

  **Workaround:** Use both visionOS 26 beta 2 and macOS 26 beta 2.
- When using the RemoteImmersiveSpace API to stream spatial content from Mac to Apple Vision Pro, an app session might have video stalls, blurry content, and black rendering on the sides if running on a Mac computer with Apple silicon.  (151322584)

  **Workaround:** Profile your application and leverage the -renderQuality API new to visionOS and macOS.
- If you port an app using Xcode template or Metal 4 with `ProgressiveImmersionStyle` for macOS spatial rendering, the app will crash on macOS.  (153574517)

  **Workaround:** Use `FullImmersionStyle`.
- When using the RemoteImmersiveSpace API to stream spatial content from Mac to Apple Vision Pro while in Travel mode, spatial stream might stall and end.  (154209388)

#### Known Issues

- The `.chart3DRenderingStyle` modifier is not functional.  (150430199)

<a id="SwiftUI"></a>

### SwiftUI

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- `ControlSize` now conforms to `Comparable`, and `View/controlSize(_:)` can now be used to clamp the environment’s `controlSize` to a given range.  (99633360) (FB11465757)
- Popovers now support customization of their corner radius, through the `presentationCornerRadius(_:)` modifier.  (112938038)
- Confirmation dialogs presented with the `.confirmationDialog` modifier now appear as popovers, anchored to the source of the presentation. When using the `.confirmationDialog` modifier, ensure this is applied to the view to which the dialog should be anchored. When presenting alerts with the `UIAlertController.Style.actionSheet` `preferredStyle`, ensure a `sourceView` is set on the alert controller’s `popoverPresentationController`.  (132598527)
- Text, TextEditor, and TextField now by default use string contents to determine the appropriate base writing direction for each paragraph, instead of relying on layout directionality. To specify the writing direction explicitly on a per-paragraph basis, use Foundation’s `AttributedString.writingDirection` attribute. To make the base writing direction follow the layout direction for an entire view, apply the view modifier `.writingDirection(strategy: .layoutBased)`.  (134821288)
- When linking news SDKs, `NavigationLink`s produce a single view, rather than a list of views in view list contexts. This change improves performance of many `NavigationLink`s in lazy containers like `List`. However, if you are relying on `ContainerValues` propagating out of the `label` view of a `NavigationLink`, or similarly relying on `ContainerValues` of a `ButtonStyle` used to style a link, the `containerValue(_:,_:)` modifier should be moved outside of the link. Below is a minimal example that demonstrates the behavior difference:

  ```swift
   import SwiftUI
   
   struct ContentView: View {
       @State private var presentPopover = false
       var body: some View {
           NavigationLink("Custom Link", value: 84)
               .buttonStyle(MyButtonStyle(containerValue: "Eighty-four"))
       }
   }
   
   struct ParentView: View {
       var body: some View {
           Group(subviews: ContentView()) { subviews in
               ForEach(subviews) { subview in
                   Text(subview.containerValues.myCustomValue)
               }
           }
           .frame(minWidth: 100, minHeight: 100)
       }
   }
   
   struct MyButtonStyle: PrimitiveButtonStyle {
       var containerValue: String
       func makeBody(configuration: Configuration) -> some View {
           Button(configuration)
               .buttonBorderShape(.circle)
               .containerValue(\.myCustomValue, containerValue)
       }
   }
   
   private struct MyContainerValueKey: ContainerValueKey {
       static let defaultValue: String = "Default value"
   }
   
   extension ContainerValues {
       var myCustomValue: String {
           get { self[MyContainerValueKey.self] }
           set { self[MyContainerValueKey.self] = newValue }
       }
   }
   
   #Preview {
       ParentView()
   }
  ```

  (140283584)
- `List` no longer ignores the vertical insets of rows with a height close to the default minimum height on iOS and visionOS. Use `listRowInsets(_:_:)` to change the vertical row insets.  (141160852)
- In `NavigationSplitView` and `TabView`s configured as `sidebarAdaptable`, the view trailing the sidebar’s safe area is inset in the width of the sidebar. It can display content outside its safe area, underneath the sidebar.  (141222137)
- SwiftUI views and presentations now support breakthrough effects. Breakthrough is an effect allowing elements to be visible to the user even when other app content (3D models, UI elements) is occluding it. To add a breakthrough effect to a SwiftUI view, add the `breakthroughEffect(_:)` modifier. To customize the breakthrough effect of a popover in a volumetric context, use the `presentationBreakthroughEffect(_:)` modifier.  (142705695)
- In apps that adopt the new design, the `buttonBorderShape(_:)` view modifier can be used to customize the shape of bordered buttons. Previously this modifier only affected buttons in Widgets in macOS.  (145773436)
- The `buttonSizing(_:)` view modifier specifies the sizing behavior of `Button`, `Picker`, `Menu`, and other button-producing controls. If you are using `Spacer` views or an infinite-width frame in your `Button` label to create a flexible button, apply `buttonSizing(.flexible)` to the `Button` instead.  (146327046)
- `Button`s using a custom `ButtonStyle` now play system interaction sounds in apps built against visionOS 26 SDK or later. `Button`s using `PrimitiveButtonStyle` do not play sounds.  (150862851)

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: `TextEditor`’s undo stack might contain invalid operations for applications with multiple `TextEditor` views.  (83650197) (FB9662463)
- Fixed: The menu content of some `Menu` views does not update as the result of a state change.  (106878937)
- Fixed: [View.onHover(perform:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/onhover%28perform:%29) and [View.onContinuousHover(coordinateSpace:perform:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/oncontinuoushover%28coordinatespace:perform:%29) affect hit-testing for gestures. Gestures are not received if one of these view modifiers is used within an overlay.  (108560020)
- Fixed: For an `ImmersiveSpace` scene, the value for defining a custom scene class via the app’s `Info.plist` is ignored.  (129389802)
- Fixed: `listSectionSpacing` does not work correctly for sections that have headers and footers. For more control over the list section layout, use the `listSectionMargins` modifier.  (140929163)
- Fixed: On iOS, `navigationSplitViewColumnWidth()` does not respect the specified minimum and maximum column widths.  (143529326)
- Fixed: Popovers presented from a view positioned at `z != 0` appear at the wrong depth.  (143571112)
- Fixed: Multiple title views in sidebar list labels on iOS are not styled hierarchically as title and subtitle.  (144253754)
- Fixed: In custom layouts that do not implement `explicitAlignment(of:in:proposal:subviews:cache:)`, alignment guides do not work correctly for a right-to-left layout direction.  (145073832)
- Fixed: Applying a `bold` modifier to `Text` resets the `weight` configuration. The interaction of `bold` and `weight` is not consistent between Text and Font.  (147270079)
- Fixed: Environment updates from outside of a popover might fail to propagate into the popover’s content view.  (147954025)
- Fixed: Two-handed gestures cancel the initial event stream.  (149026305)
- Fixed: On platforms supporting edge-attached and non-edge-attached sheets, non-edge-attached sheets present erroneously as full-screen covers when `.navigationTransition(.zoom...)` is specified. If you wish to keep the full-screen cover in compact size classes, configure a sheet with:

  ```swift
   .sheet(...) {
      ContentView()
       .navigationTransition(.zoom...)
       .presentationSizing(.page)
       .presentationCompactAdaptation(.fullScreen)
  ```

  (150455117)
- Fixed: Standard gesture precedence and failure requirements do not work with `.manipulable`. Nested gestures always take precedence even if they fail.  (150773003)
- Fixed: When presenting a context menu from an ornament or attachment in a Volume, the context menu might not appear relative to origin.  (151803598)
- Fixed: When using the `.hoverEffectDisabled(true)` and `.manipulable` modifiers on the same view, the hover effect glow will still be visible.  (151810879)
- Fixed: If Default Actor Isolation is set to `MainActor`, `@Animatable` macro emits concurrency warnings in Swift 5 language mode and does not compile in Swift 6 language mode.  (152524435)
- Fixed: Gestures do not have the same lower priority over the view’s existing `UIGestureRecognizer`s and `NSGestureRecognizer`s as they do over the view’s existing SwiftUI gestures.

  In apps built with iOS 26, macOS 26, tvOS 26, and visionOS 26, use [highPriorityGesture(\_:isEnabled:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/highprioritygesture%28_:isenabled:%29) to make sure your gesture takes precedence over the view’s existing gestures, or use [simultaneousGesture(\_:isEnabled:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/simultaneousgesture%28_:isenabled:%29) to give your gesture the same priority as the view’s existing gestures.  (155581361)
- Fixed: On visionOS, tvOS, and watchOS, sheets presented within toolbar items might fail to present if the toolbar item’s label view is a `Label`.  (157326248)

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- `DragGesture` has a default `minimumDistance` of 10, which is unitless.  (144949485)

  **Workaround:** When adding a `DragGesture` to an entity, use `DragGesture(minimumDistance: 0.001, coordinateSpace: .local)` to make the minimum distance 1 millimeter.
- When a popover is presented from a SwiftUI view within a volume, moving around the volume might cause the popover to become detached from its source content.  (147066605)
- When a background is set for a table view, the header does not adopt the color. This results in the table having the specified color but the header having a transparent background.  (150483611)

  **Workaround:** Refrain from setting a background on table views.
- When using `.manipulable` modifier on content within a `ScrollView`, if the user is looking at the manipulable item when trying to perform an indirect scroll gesture, manipulation will take precedence over scrolling.  (151659525)
- The detailed surface information classification API might unexpectedly be “none”.  (151820408)
- The `breakthroughEffect(_:)` and `presentationBreakthroughEffect(_:)` modifiers have no effect in the simulator.  (152112050)

<a id="Deprecations"></a>

#### Deprecations

- `Text` concatenation using the `+` operator is deprecated because it makes it hard to create localized strings that are correct across all languages. Use `Text` interpolation instead. See documentation on `Text` for more info on how to produce localized strings.  (128144043)

<a id="TabletopKit"></a>

### TabletopKit

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- Using the `CustomAction` API, you can implement custom actions that previously required multiple built-in actions (for example, setting the board for a game of chess). This can reduce network traffic and allow you to define a behavior that is either executed or rolled back atomically on all peers.  (150326238)
- Equipment states can now have custom data via the new `CustomEquipmentState` API.  (150762229)

<a id="Deprecations"></a>

#### Deprecations

- `interactionWasUpdated` has been deprecated because only some of the provided information is reliably available for remote interactions. The preferred alternative is polling the cursors in the `onUpdate` function of the `TabletopGame.RenderDelegate`.  (150762273)

<a id="TextKit"></a>

### TextKit

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- iOS 26, tvOS 26, visionOS 26, watchOS 26, and macOS Tahoe 26 have two methods for resolving the natural alignment `NSTextAlignment.natural` and the last line of `NSTextAlignment.justified` into concrete alignments, `left` and `right`. The first approach utilizes the UI language, which is determined by passing nil-language to `NSParagraphStyle.defaultWritingDirection(forLanguage: )`. This behavior was employed prior to this release. The second method is new and dynamically utilizes the base writing direction for the paragraph. When the base writing direction is set to `NSWritingDirection.rightToLeft`, the text is aligned to `right`, and vice versa. The behavior is selected by API introduced in this major release: `NSTextLayoutManager.resolvesNaturalAlignmentWithBaseWritingDirection`, `NSStringDrawingOptionsResolvesNaturalAlignmentWithBaseWritingDirection`, `UITraitCollection.resolvesNaturalAlignmentWithBaseWritingDirection`, and `NSTextField.resolvesNaturalAlignmentWithBaseWritingDirection`.  (152045248)

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: The directionality of `NSParagraphStyle` indentation properties (`firstLineHeadIndent`, `headIndent`, and `tailIndent`) is determined by inconsistent hidden rules implemented by the TextKit typesetting engine.

  With iOS 26, macOS 26, tvOS 26, watchOS 26, and visionOS 26, the TextKit 2 typesetting engine has been standardized to utilize the resolved writing direction for the paragraph when linked with the OS 26 versions of the corresponding SDKs. For binary compatibility, applications developed with prior SDK versions will use the UI language in a subset of API interfaces. Specifically, for `UILabel`, `NSTextField`, `SwiftUI.Text`, and `NSStringDrawing`, the indentation directionality is determined by the UI language queried by passing nil to `NSParagraphStyle. defaultWritingDirection()` in applications built with prior SDK versions.  (155893102)

<a id="UI-Frameworks"></a>

### UI Frameworks

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: Non-SF Symbol images in TabBars and TabViews default to template rendering.  (142894523)
- Fixed: `.hoverEffectsDisabled()` does not disable highlight effects on links within `SwiftUI.Text` views.  (148559710)
- Fixed: Gaze hover effects might not appear on controls when occluded by another object.  (149493534)

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- Text Effect Windows might be partially cut off when triggered from SwiftUI text fields that are positioned in an ornament at `.topTrailingBack`.  (142326671)
- Apps might receive activation and deactivation notifications when viewing Apple Immersive Video.  (148774882)

<a id="UIKit"></a>

### UIKit

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- Confirmation dialogs presented with the `UIAlertController.Style.actionSheet` `preferredStyle` now appear as popovers, anchored to the source of the presentation. When using the `.confirmationDialog` modifier, ensure this is applied to the view to which the dialog should be anchored. When presenting alerts with the `UIAlertController.Style.actionSheet` `preferredStyle`, ensure a `sourceView` is set on the alert controller’s `popoverPresentationController`.  (152537984)

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- Popovers, action sheets, and context menus from within a `RealityView` attachment might cause the presented content to appear at the wrong location.  (147613953)
- UIKit non-interactive table view rows might respond to gaze, potentially leading users to perceive them as unresponsive and challenging to navigate.  (150958738)

  **Workaround:** Use SwiftUI or CollectionViews.

<a id="Deprecations"></a>

#### Deprecations

- `UIScreen.mainScreen` has been changed from `API_TO_BE_DEPRECATED` to deprecated in iOS 26, tvOS 26, and visionOS 26.  (142902390)

<a id="Video-Toolbox"></a>

### Video Toolbox

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

#### Known Issues

- A site will crash when using a 3D model with audio in `<model>`.  (146899549)

  **Workaround:** Use a 3D model without audio.
- Some USDZ models with compressed textures might render without textures in HTML `<model>` elements.  (155650658)

  **Workaround:** Do not compress the textures.

<a id="WebKit-API"></a>

### WebKit API

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- The `load` APIs on `WebPage` now return an `AsyncSequence` directly that can be used to track relevant navigation events. The `currentNavigationEvent` property has been removed in favor of the `navigations` property, which produces an indefinite sequence directly.  (152414525)
- The `WebPage` API now supports directly loading URLs. Additionally, when loading an HTML string, there is now a default value for the `baseURL` parameter.  (152904248) (FB17850359)

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: iOS widgets do not appear in the visionOS Widgets app while using visionOS simulator.  (150067581)
- Fixed: In the Widgets app, app icons in Widget Library might appear as placeholders when running on simulator.  (150547965)
- Fixed: A visionOS app project might not auto-select the built widget, and the widget will be left in the Suggested section in the Widgets app.  (153326762)

<a id="Window-Sharing"></a>

### Window Sharing

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- Window sharing on visionOS can now be started and managed from People View. Tap the Nearby button and select nearby people to start window sharing with, invite nearby people to join your active FaceTime call, and manage your window sharing sessions, all in one place.  (154800877)
