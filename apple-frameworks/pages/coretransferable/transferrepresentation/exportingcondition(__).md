# exportingCondition(\_:)

**Framework:** Core Transferable  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 16.0+ · iPadOS 16.0+ · Mac Catalyst 16.0+ · macOS 13.0+ · tvOS 16.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 9.0+

Prevents the system from exporting an item if it does not meet the supplied condition.

## Declaration

```swift
func exportingCondition(_ condition: @escaping @Sendable (Self.Item) -> Bool) -> _ConditionalTransferRepresentation<Self>
```

## Parameters

- `condition`: A closure that determines whether the item is exportable. Don’t perform long-running work in this closure. It shouldn’t contain network requests, file operations, or other potentially time-consuming tasks as they can cause delays during operations with `Transferable` items.

## Discussion

Some instances of a model type may have state-dependent conditions that make them unsuitable for export. For example, an `Archive` structure that supports a comma-separated text representation only when it has compatible content:

```swift
struct Archive {
    var supportsCSV: Bool
    func csvData() -> Data
    init(csvData: Data)
}

extension Archive: Transferable {
    static var transferRepresentation: some TransferRepresentation {
        DataRepresentation(contentType: .commaSeparatedText) { archive in
            archive.csvData()
        } importing: { data in Archive(csvData: data) }
            .exportingCondition { archive in archive.supportsCSV }
    }
}
```
