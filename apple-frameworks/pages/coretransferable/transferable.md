# Transferable

**Framework:** Core Transferable  
**Kind:** Protocol  
**Availability:** iOS 16.0+ · iPadOS 16.0+ · Mac Catalyst 16.0+ · macOS 13.0+ · tvOS 16.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 9.0+

A protocol that describes how a type interacts with transport APIs such as drag and drop or copy and paste.

## Declaration

```swift
@preconcurrency protocol Transferable : Sendable
```

## Overview

To conform to the [Transferable](transferable.md) protocol, implement the [transferRepresentation](transferable/transferrepresentation.md) property. For example, an image editing app’s layer type might conform to `Transferable` to let people drag and drop image layers to reorder them within a document.

```swift
struct ImageDocumentLayer {
    init(data: Data) { }
    func data() -> Data { Data() }
    func pngData() -> Data { Data() }
}
```

The following shows how you can extend `ImageDocumentLayer`  to conform to `Transferable`:

```swift
extension ImageDocumentLayer: Transferable {
    static var transferRepresentation: some TransferRepresentation {
        DataRepresentation(contentType: .layer) { layer in
            layer.data()
        } importing: { data in
            ImageDocumentLayer(data: data)
        }
        DataRepresentation(exportedContentType: .png) { layer in
            layer.pngData()
        }
    }
}
```

When people drag and drop a layer within the app or onto another app that recognizes the custom `layer` content type, the app uses the first representation. When people drag and drop the layer onto a different image editor, it’s likely that the editor recognizes the PNG file type. The second transfer representation adds support for PNG files.

The following declares the custom `layer` uniform type identifier:

```swift
extension UTType {
    static let layer = UTType(exportedAs: "com.example.layer")
}
```

> **Important**

> If your app declares custom uniform type identifiers, include corresponding entries in the app’s `Info.plist`. For more information, see [Defining file and data types for your app](../uniformtypeidentifiers/defining-file-and-data-types-for-your-app.md).

If one of your existing types conforms to [Codable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/codable), `Transferable` automatically handles conversion to and from `Data`. The following declares a simple `Note` structure that’s `Codable` and an extension to make it `Transferable`:

```swift
struct Note: Codable {
    let title: String
    let body: String
}

extension Note: Transferable {
    static var transferRepresentation: some TransferRepresentation {
        CodableRepresentation(contentType: .note)
    }
}
```

To ensure compatibility with other apps that don’t know about the custom `note` type identifier, the following adds an additional transfer representation that converts the note to text.

```swift
extension Note: Transferable {
    static var transferRepresentation: some TransferRepresentation {
        CodableRepresentation(contentType: .note)
        ProxyRepresentation(\.title)
    }
}
```

The order of the representations in the transfer representation matters; place the representation that most accurately represents your type first, followed by a sequence of more compatible but less preferable representations.

## Topics

### Implementing a transfer representation

- [transferRepresentation](transferable/transferrepresentation.md): The representation used to import and export the item.
- [Representation](transferable/representation.md): The type of the representation used to import and export the item.

### Initializers

- [init(importing:contentType:)](transferable/init%28importing_contenttype_%29-4pfpm.md): Using the type’s `Transferable` conformance implementation, instantiates a value from the given file.
- [init(importing:contentType:)](transferable/init%28importing_contenttype_%29-74t08.md): Using the type’s `Transferable` conformance implementation, instantiates a value from given data.

### Instance Properties

- [suggestedFilename](transferable/suggestedfilename.md): A suggested filename of a `Transferable` value.

### Instance Methods

- [export(to:contentType:)](transferable/export%28to_contenttype_%29.md): Using the type’s `Transferable` conformance implementation, exports a value by writing it to a provided destination directory.
- [exported(as:)](transferable/exported%28as_%29.md): Using the type’s `Transferable` conformance implementation, exports a value as binary data.
- [exportedContentTypes(\_:)](transferable/exportedcontenttypes%28__%29.md): Content types supported by a given value’s `Transferable` conformance for export (like drag or copy).
- [importedContentTypes()](transferable/importedcontenttypes%28%29-swift.method.md): Content types supported by a given value’s `Transferable` conformance for import (like drop or paste).
- [withExportedFile(contentType:fileHandler:)](transferable/withexportedfile%28contenttype_filehandler_%29.md): Using the type’s `Transferable` conformance implementation, exports a value by writing it to disk and removes when not needed.

### Type Methods

- [exportedContentTypes(visibility:)](transferable/exportedcontenttypes%28visibility_%29.md): The types that the instance of a `Transferable` is able to provide a representation for.
- [importedContentTypes()](transferable/importedcontenttypes%28%29-swift.type.method.md): Content types statically supported by the `Transferable` conformance of the type for import (like drop or paste).
