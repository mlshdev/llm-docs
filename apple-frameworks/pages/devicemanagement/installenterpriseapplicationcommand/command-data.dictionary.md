# InstallEnterpriseApplicationCommand.Command

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** Device Management  
**Kind:** Device Management Command  
**Availability:** macOS 10.13.6+

The command to install an enterprise app on a device.

## Declaration

```
object InstallEnterpriseApplicationCommand.Command
```

## Properties

- `ChangeManagementState` — `string`: The change management state. This value doesn’t work with the user enrollments. The only possible value is:

  - `Managed`: Take management of the app if the user installed it already and `InstallAsManaged` is `true`.

  Available: macOS 11+  
  **Allowed values:** `Managed`
- `Configuration` — `InstallEnterpriseApplicationCommand.Command.Configuration`: A dictionary that contains the initial configuration of the app, if you choose to provide it.

  Available: macOS 11+
- `InstallAsManaged` — `boolean`: If `true`, install the app as a managed app. Otherwise, the system installs the app as unmanaged. If you reinstall a manged app and omit this value or set it to `false`, the app becomes unmanaged.

  For manifest-based installs, if `true`, the system only considers apps installed in `/Applications` as managed. In macOS 11 through 13, the system requires that the `pkg` only contains a single signed app.

  Available: macOS 11+  
  **Default:** `false`
- `iOSApp` — `boolean`: If `true`, the app is an iOS app that can run on a Mac with Apple silicon in macOS 11 and later.

  Available: macOS 11+  
  **Default:** `false`
- `ManagementFlags` — `integer`: The management flags. The possible values are:

  - `1`: If `InstallAsManaged` is `true`, remove the app upon removal of the MDM profile.

  Available: macOS 11+  
  **Allowed values:** `1`
- `Manifest` — `InstallEnterpriseApplicationCommand.Command.Manifest`: A dictionary that specifies where to download the app. This value uses the [ManifestURL](../manifesturl.md) format.
- `ManifestURL` — `string`: The URL of the app manifest, which needs to begin with `https:`. The manifest is returned as a property list that uses the [ManifestURL](../manifesturl.md) format.
- `ManifestURLPinningCerts` — `[data]`: An array of DER-encoded certificates to pin the connection when fetching the `ManifestURL`.
- `PinningRevocationCheckRequired` — `boolean`: If `true`, certificate revocation checks require a positive response when using certificate pinning with `ManifestURLPinningCerts`.
  **Default:** `false`
- `RequestRequiresNetworkTether` — `boolean`: If `true`, the device needs to be network-tethered to run the command.
  **Default:** `false`
- `RequestType` — `string` (required): The request type for this command.
  **Allowed values:** `InstallEnterpriseApplication`
