# ReturnToServiceResponse.ReturnToService

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** Device Management  
**Kind:** Device Management Command  
**Availability:** iOS 26.0+ · iPadOS 26.0+ · Mac Catalyst 26.0+ · visionOS 26.0+

A dictionary containing the configuration for return to service.

## Declaration

```
object ReturnToServiceResponse.ReturnToService
```

## Properties

- `BootstrapToken` — `data`: The system uses the bootstrap token for return to service with app preservation. The device requires this key when Automated Device Enrollment enables return to service for the device.

  If the bootstrap token isn’t present, the device performs a full erasure and a regular return to service, and can’t preserve any data for app preservation.
- `Enabled` — `boolean` (required): If `true`, the device automatically erases itself and then performs reenrollment.
- `MDMProfileData` — `data`: The MDM profile that installs after erasure when using return to service. If provided, the device uses this profile directly instead of fetching it from the server. The device requires this key if its Automated Device Enrollment profile contains the `configuration-web-url` key.

  The device always downloads the Automated Device Enrollment profile even when this key is present, so the supervision identity, MDM removability, and other settings still apply. However, the device doesn’t use the specified URL in the Automated Device Enrollment profile to fetch the MDM profile.
- `ShouldRetryEnrollment` — `boolean`: If `true`, the device retries service enrollment when the initial enrollment fails after erasure.

  Available: iOS 27+ | iPadOS 27+  
  **Default:** `false`
- `WiFiProfileData` — `data`: The Wi-Fi profile that installs after erasure when using return to service. The device requires this when it doesn’t have Ethernet access.
