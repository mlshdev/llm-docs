The declaration to configure audio accessory settings.

## Declaration

```
object AudioAccessorySettings
```

## Properties

- `TemporaryPairing` — `AudioAccessorySettingsTemporaryPairingObject`: A dictionary that describes audio accessory temporary pairing behavior. The device enables temporary pairing when this key is present and the `Disabled` key isn’t `false`. The device doesn’t synchronize pairing information with iCloud when temporary pairing is active.

## Discussion

Specify `com.apple.configuration.audio-accessory.settings` as the declaration type.

Setting `TemporaryPairing` to `false` disables only the temporary pairing feature, without impacting any other use of audio accessories, so users can still:

- Pair and use audio accessories - the device records the pairing and synchronizes it to their iCloud account.
- Use the audio accessory AirPods Sharing feature.
