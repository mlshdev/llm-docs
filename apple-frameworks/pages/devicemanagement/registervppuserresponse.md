## Declaration

```
object RegisterVppUserResponse
```

## Properties

- `clientContext` — `string`: The value currently associated with the provided `sToken`. This field is only included in the response when a value is set with the [Client Configuration](client-configuration.md) endpoint.
- `errorMessage` — `string`: The human-readable explanation of the error.
- `errorNumber` — `int32`: The numeric code of the error.
- `expirationMillis` — `int64`: The UNIX epoch timestamp, in milliseconds, when the account’s `sToken` or password expires (whichever is earlier).
- `location` — `VppLocation`: The location associated with the provided sToken. This field is only returned when a location token is used with an Apple School Manager account.
- `status` — `int32`: The status code for the response. Possible values are:

  `0` = Success. `-1` = Failure.
- `uId` — `string`: The unique library identifier. When querying records using multiple tokens that may share libraries, use the `uId` field to filter duplicates. In this way, you can avoid double-counting records when duplicate tokens are uploaded by different content managers.
- `user` — `VppUser`: The newly registered user.
