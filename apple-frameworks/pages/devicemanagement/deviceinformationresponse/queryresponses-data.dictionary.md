  The value is an array of certificates in DER form that forms a certificate chain. The chain is rooted with the Apple CA `Apple Enterprise Attestation Root CA`. The first array item is the leaf certificate. The leaf certificate contains custom OIDs describing a device. The OS version of the device, and the type of enrollment, determine which OIDs are present in the certificate. If Apple’s attestation servers are unable to verify a device property they generate a blank value, omit the OID entirely, or refuse to issue an attestation certificate.

  The following OIDs were introduced in iOS 16, iPadOS 16, tvOS 16, watchOS 10, visionOS 1 and macOS 14:

  - `1.2.840.113635.100.8.9.1` serial number: This is the serial number of the device. It’s omitted if the enrollment is a user enrollment.
  - `1.2.840.113635.100.8.9.2` UDID: For a Mac this has the same value as the `ProvisioningUDID` key, and doesn’t match the UDID used elsewhere in the MDM protocol. It’s omitted if the enrollment is a user enrollment.
  - `1.2.840.113635.100.8.10.2` sepOS version: This is the version of the operating system running on the Secure Enclave when the attestation is generated. Typically this matches the version of the main operating system.
  - `1.2.840.113635.100.8.11.1` Freshness code: This is the freshness code. See the `DeviceAttestationNonce`. This may not match the requested freshness code if the device returned a cached attestation.

  The following OIDs were introduced in iOS 17.2, iPadOS 17.2, tvOS 17.2, watchOS 10.2, visionOS 1.l0, and macOS 14.2:

  - `1.2.840.113635.100.8.9.4` Software Update Device ID: This is an identifier of the device model. It’s expected to match the `SoftwareUpdateDeviceID` in the \`DeviceInformation\`\` response. This is the device identifier to use when looking up available OS updates through [https://gdmf.apple.com/v2/pmv](https://gdmf.apple.com/v2/pmv).
  - `1.2.840.113635.100.8.10.1` OS Version: This is the version of iOS, iPadOS or tvOS running on the device when the attestation is generated.
  - `1.2.840.113635.100.8.10.3` LLB Version: This is the version of the Low Level Bootloader firmware running on the device when the attestation is generated. For more information about the boot process, see the documentation of the boot process in the Apple Platform Security guide.

  The following OIDs were introduced in macOS 14.2:

  - `1.2.840.113635.100.8.13.1` System Integrity Protection (SIP) status: This indicates whether SIP is enabled or disabled when the attestation is generated. `0` indicates enabled, `1` indicates disabled.
  - `1.2.840.113635.100.8.13.2` Secure boot status: This describes part of the configuration of the LocalPolicy when the attestation is generated. The values are `Full Security`, `Reduced Security`, or `Permissive Security`. For a description of these values see the Apple Platform Security guide.
  - `1.2.840.113635.100.8.13.3` Third party kernel extensions allowed: This indicates whether third party kernel extensions are allowed. A value of `0` indicates third party kernel extensions aren’t allowed. Any other value means that some kinds of third party kernel extensions are allowed.
