# NetworkRelay

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** Device Management  
**Kind:** Object  
**Availability:** iOS 27.0+ · iPadOS 27.0+ · Mac Catalyst 27.0+ · macOS 27.0+ · visionOS 27.0+

The declaration to configure Network Relay settings.

## Declaration

```
object NetworkRelay
```

## Properties

- `AllowDNSFailover` — `boolean`: If `true`, the device allows the relay to failover to the default system DNS resolver.
  **Default:** `false`
- `ExcludedDomains` — `[string]`: A list of domain strings to exclude from routing through the servers in `Relays`. Any connection that matches a domain in the list exactly or is a subdomain of the listed domain won’t use the relay server.
- `ExcludedFQDNs` — `[string]`: A list of Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs) to exclude from routing through the servers contained in `Relays`. Any connection that matches an FQDN in the list exactly won’t use the relay server. When `MatchDomains` is also present, any FQDN listed in the list should be a subdomain of at least one `MatchDomain` value, otherwise it won’t have any effect.
- `MatchDomains` — `[string]`: A list of domain strings that the system uses to determine which connection to route through the servers in `Relays`.

  Any connection that matches a domain in the list exactly or is a subdomain of the listed domain uses the relay servers, unless it matches a domain in `ExcludedDomains`.

  If this list and `MatchFQDNs` are empty, the system routes traffic to all domains to the relay servers, except those that match an excluded domain or excluded FQDN.
- `MatchFQDNs` — `[string]`: A list of Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs) to route through the servers contained in `Relays`. Any connection that matches an FQDN in the list exactly uses the relay servers. If this list and `MatchDomains` are empty, the system routes traffic to all domains to the relay servers, except those that match an excluded domain or excluded FQDN.
- `Relays` — `[NetworkRelayRelayObject]` (required): An array of dictionaries that describe one or more relay servers that the system can chain together.
- `RelayUUID` — `string`: A globally unique identifier for this relay configuration. The system uses this UUID to route managed apps through the servers in `Relays`. This key is required for user enrollment.

  Available: iOS 27+ | iPadOS 27+ | visionOS 27+
- `UIToggleEnabled` — `boolean`: If `true`, the device allows the user to disable this network relay configuration.
  **Default:** `true`
- `VisibleName` — `string` (required): The name of the network relays that the system displays on the device.

### Configuration examples

**Single relay**

This configuration routes traffic to two domains through a single HTTP/2 relay with a custom authorization header.

```json
{
    "Type": "com.apple.configuration.network.relay",
    "Identifier": "EB13EE2B-5D63-4EBA-810F-5B81D07F5017",
    "ServerToken": "E180CA9A-F089-4FA3-BBDF-94CC159C4AE8",
    "Payload": {
        "VisibleName": "Corporate Relay",
        "Relays": [
            {
                "HTTP2RelayURL": "https://relay.example.com/proxy",
                "AdditionalHTTPHeaderFields": {
                    "Authorization": "Bearer enterprise-token-12345"
                }
            }
        ],
        "MatchDomains": ["example.com", "internal.example.com"],
        "RelayUUID": "C3D4E5F6-A7B8-9012-CDEF-123456789012",
        "UIToggleEnabled": false
    }
}
```

**Chained relays**

This configuration routes specific hostnames through two chained relay hops supporting both HTTP/2 and HTTP/3.

```json
{
    "Type": "com.apple.configuration.network.relay",
    "Identifier": "2A3B4C5D-6E7F-8A9B-0C1D-2E3F4A5B6C7D",
    "ServerToken": "F1E2D3C4-B5A6-7890-ABCD-EF1234567890",
    "Payload": {
        "VisibleName": "Two-Hop Privacy Relay",
        "Relays": [
            {
                "HTTP3RelayURL": "https://relay1.example.com/hop1",
                "HTTP2RelayURL": "https://relay1.example.com/hop1"
            },
            {
                "HTTP3RelayURL": "https://relay2.example.com/hop2"
            }
        ],
        "MatchFQDNs": ["secure.example.com", "api.example.com"],
        "ExcludedDomains": ["cdn.example.com"],
        "RelayUUID": "D4E5F6A7-B8C9-0123-DEF0-234567890123",
        "AllowDNSFailover": true
    }
}
```
