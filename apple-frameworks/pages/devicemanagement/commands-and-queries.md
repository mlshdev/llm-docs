**Kind:** API Collection

Remotely execute management commands and queries on managed devices.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

The Mobile Device Management (MDM) protocol provides a way to tell a device to remotely execute certain management commands or queries. When a device registers with the device management service, the service sends push notifications to the device when there are commands to process on the device.

When the device receives the notification, it polls the device management service for the command, processes the command, and reports the command results to the service. The device then checks for other commands to process.

> **Important**

>  Device management is for enterprise use only. To use it in your app, the Account Holder of your app’s development team must request the Mobile Device Management capability. For more information, see [Request a Mobile Device Management Capability](https://developer.apple.com/contact/request/mdm-capability).
