- `declaration-identifier` — `string`: The identifier of the declaration that controls the app.
- `external-version-id` — `integer`: The app’s external version identifier. You can also retrieve this value from the App Store. For more information, see [Apps and books metadata for organizations](apps-and-books-metadata-for-organizations.md).

  If the current external version identifier of an app on the App Store doesn’t match the external version identifier reported by the device, there may be an app update available for the device.
- `identifier` — `string` (required): The app’s bundle id, which is unique.

  - `not-present`: Management of the app occurs after it’s installed.
  - `prompting-for-consent`: The system is displaying a prompt to the user to proceed with app installation.
