**Framework:** Device Management  
**Kind:** Device Management Profile

The properties common to all payloads.

## Declaration

```
object CommonPayloadKeys
```

## Properties

- `PayloadDescription` — `string`: The human-readable description of this payload. This description appears on the Detail screen.
- `PayloadDisplayName` — `string`: The human-readable name for the profile payload. The name appears on the Detail screen and doesn’t need to be unique.
- `PayloadIdentifier` — `string` (required): The reverse-DNS-style identifier for the payload. This identifier is usually the same as the [TopLevel](toplevel.md) value, with an additional appended component. This string must be unique within the profile.

  During a profile replacement, the system updates payloads with the same `PayloadIdentifier` and `PayloadUUID` in the old and new profiles.
- `PayloadOrganization` — `string`: The human-readable string containing the name of the organization that provides the profile. This value doesn’t need to match the organization payload value in the enclosing dictionary.
- `PayloadType` — `string` (required): The payload type, which each payload domain’s reference page specifies.
- `PayloadUUID` — `string` (required): The globally unique identifier for the payload. The actual content is unimportant, but must be globally unique. In macOS, use `uuidgen` to generate UUIDs.

  During a profile replacement, the system updates payloads with the same `PayloadIdentifier` and `PayloadUUID` in the old and new profiles.
- `PayloadVersion` — `integer` (required): The version of this specific payload.
  **Allowed values:** `1`
