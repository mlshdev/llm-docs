Each key in the dictionary represents a composed identifier for a specific managed extension, or you can specify a single “\*” character to match any extension. The dictionary values represent the settings that Safari applies to each extension that matches the key. In order for the extension to be managed, its host app needs to be present on the device.

## Discussion

The composed identifier of a managed extension uses the format “Identifier (TeamIdentifier)”, for example “com.example.app (ABCD1234)”. Use `codesign -dv <path_to_appex>` to show the information you need to generate this string on macOS, using the path to the extension bundle located in the “PlugIns” folder inside the app bundle. For other platforms, request this information from the app developer.
