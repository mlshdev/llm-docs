# NetworkDNSSettingsDNSSettingsObject

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** Device Management  
**Kind:** Object  
**Availability:** iOS 27.0+ · iPadOS 27.0+ · Mac Catalyst 27.0+ · macOS 27.0+ · visionOS 27.0+

A dictionary that defines a configuration for an encrypted DNS server.

## Declaration

```
object NetworkDNSSettingsDNSSettingsObject
```

## Properties

- `AllowFailover` — `boolean`: If `true`, the device allows failover to the default system DNS resolver.
  **Default:** `false`
- `DNSProtocol` — `string` (required): The encrypted transport protocol used to communicate with the DNS server.
  **Allowed values:** `HTTPS`, `TLS`
- `IdentityAssetReference` — `string`: Specifies the identifier of an asset declaration containing an identity that the system uses to authenticate the user to the DNS resolver.
- `ServerAddresses` — `[string]`: An unordered list of DNS server IP address strings. These IP addresses can be a mixture of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
- `ServerName` — `string`: The hostname of a DNS-over-TLS server used to validate the server certificate, as defined in RFC 7858. If no `ServerAddresses` are provided, the system uses the hostname to determine the server addresses. This key must be present only if the DNSProtocol is `TLS`.
- `ServerURL` — `string`: The URI template of a DNS-over-HTTPS server, as defined in RFC 8484. This URL needs to use the `https://` scheme, and the system uses the hostname or address in the URL to validate the server certificate. If no `ServerAddresses` are provided, the system uses the hostname or address in the URL to determine the server addresses. Required if `DNSProtocol` is `HTTPS`.
- `SupplementalMatchDomains` — `[string]`: A list of domain strings used to determine which DNS queries use the DNS server. If not set, all domains use the DNS server.

  The system supports a single wildcard (`\*`) prefix, but it’s not required. For example, both `\*.example.com` and `example.com` match against `mydomain.example.com` and `your.domain.example.com`, but don’t match against `mydomain-example.com`.

### Objects

- [NetworkDNSSettingsOnDemandRulesElementObject](networkdnssettingsondemandruleselementobject.md): An array of rules that define the DNS settings. If not set, the system always applies the DNS settings. These rules are identical to the `OnDemandRules` array in VPN payloads.
