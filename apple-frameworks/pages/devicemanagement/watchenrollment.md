# WatchEnrollment

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** Device Management  
**Kind:** Object  
**Availability:** iOS 17.0+ · iPadOS 17.0+ · Mac Catalyst 17.0+

The declaration to configure an MDMv1 profile for Apple Watch enrollment.

## Declaration

```
object WatchEnrollment
```

## Properties

- `AnchorCertificateAssetReferences` — `[string]`: An array of identifiers of asset declarations that contain anchor certificates to use to evaluate the trust of the enrollment profile server. Set the type of the corresponding assets to `com.apple.asset.credential.certificate`.

  These certificates are pinned, meaning that the server specified by the `EnrollmentProfileURL` must use a certificate that chains to one of the certs in this array.

  If it chains to one of the built-in trusted root certificates but not one of the `AnchorCertificateAssetReferences` certs, the connection will fail.
- `EnrollmentProfileURL` — `string` (required): The URL of the profile that the Apple Watch downloads and installs if the user opts in to management during the pairing process, which needs to start with `https://`. Successful enrollment requires that the pairing iPhone is supervised and the profile contains an MDM payload. Apple Watch attempts to install each payload that the profile contains.
