# AirPlay.AllowListItem

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** Device Management  
**Kind:** Device Management Profile  
**Availability:** iOS 7.0+ (deprecated in 14.5) · iPadOS 7.0+ (deprecated in 14.5) · Mac Catalyst 7.0+ (deprecated in 14.5) · macOS 10.10+ (deprecated in 11.3)

The dictionary that defines allowed destinations.

## Declaration

```
object AirPlay.AllowListItem
```

## Properties

- `DeviceID` — `string`: The device ID of the AirPlay destination in the format `xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx`. This field isn’t case-sensitive.

  The system limits the list of visible AirPlay destinations to devices that are present in the `AllowList` field of all installed AirPlay payloads.

  Specifying the same MACAddress more than once, whether in the same payload across different payloads, results in undefined behavior.

  As of tvOS 18, `DeviceID` isn’t supported.

  Deprecated: iOS 18+ | iPadOS 18+ | macOS 15+
