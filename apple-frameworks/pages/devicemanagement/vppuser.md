# VppUser

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** Device Management  
**Kind:** Object  
**Availability:** VPP License Management 1.0+

A user within the purchase program.

## Declaration

```
object VppUser
```

## Properties

- `clientUserIdStr` — `string`: The identifier supplied by the client when registering a user. An identifier must be unique within the organization.
- `email` — `string`: The user’s email address.
- `itsIdHash` — `string`: The hash of the user’s iTunes Store ID. The `itsIdHash` field is included only when the user is associated with an iTunes Store account.
- `licenses` — `[VppLicense]`: The list of licenses which have been assigned to this user.
- `status` — `string`: The status of the user’s account in VPP. Possible values are:

  - `Registered`: Indicates the user has been created, but is not yet associated with an iTunes account.
  - `Associated`: Indicates that the user has been associated with an iTunes account. When a user is associated with an iTunes account, an `itsIdHash` is generated for the user.
  - `Retired`: Indicates the user has been retired via  [Retire a User](retire-a-user.md).
  - `Deleted`: Indicates that a VPP user is retired and its associated iTunes user has since been invited and associated with a new VPP user that shares the same `clientUserIdStr`. Because there are two VPP users with distinct `userId` values but the same `clientUserIdStr` value, the Deleted status is used to ensure database consistency.

  A user with a `Deleted` status will never change status; its sole purpose is to ensure that your software can recognize that the userId is no longer associated with the `clientUserIdStr` record, and update any internal references appropriately.
- `userId` — `int64`: The unique identifier assigned by the VPP when registering the user.
