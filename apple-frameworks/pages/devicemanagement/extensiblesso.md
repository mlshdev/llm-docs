# ExtensibleSSO

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** Device Management  
**Kind:** Object  
**Availability:** iOS 27.0+ · iPadOS 27.0+ · Mac Catalyst 27.0+ · macOS 27.0+ · visionOS 27.0+

The declaration to configure Extensible Single Sign-On.

## Declaration

```
object ExtensibleSSO
```

## Properties

- `DeniedBundleIdentifiers` — `[string]`: An array of bundle identifiers of apps that don’t use SSO provided by this extension.
- `ExtensionComposedIdentifier` — `string` (required): The identifier of the provider to use for this configuration. Useful for apps that contain more than one DNS proxy extension.

  In iOS and visionOS, the identifier is a bundle ID, for example, “com.example.app.sso-extension”.

  In macOS, the identifier is a composed identifier. The format of the composed identifier is “Bundle-ID (Team-ID)”. “Bundle-ID” is the bundle identifier string of the app extension. “Team-ID” is the team identifier from the app extension’s code signature. For example, “com.example.app.sso-extension (ABCD1234)”.
- `ExtensionData` — `ExtensibleSSOExtensionDataObject`: A dictionary of arbitrary data passed through to the app extension.
- `Hosts` — `[string]`: An array of host or domain names that apps can authenticate through the app extension.

  Required for `Credential` payloads. Ignored for `Redirect` payloads.

  The system:

  - Matches host or domain names case-insensitively
  - Requires that all the host and domain names of all installed Extensible SSO payloads are unique

  > **Note**

  >  Host names that begin with a “.” are wildcard suffixes that match all subdomains; otherwise the host name needs be an exact match.
- `PlatformSSO` — `ExtensibleSSOPlatformSSOObject`: The dictionary to configure Platform SSO.

  Available: macOS 27+
- `Realm` — `string`: The realm name for `Credential` payloads. Use proper capitalization for this value. Ignored for `Redirect` payloads.
- `ScreenLockedBehavior` — `string`: If set to `Cancel`, the system cancels authentication requests when the screen is locked. If set to `DoNotHandle`, the request continues without SSO instead. This doesn’t apply to requests where `userInterfaceEnabled` is `false`, or for background [URLSession](../foundation/urlsession.md) requests.
  **Default:** `Cancel`  
  **Allowed values:** `Cancel`, `DoNotHandle`
- `Type` — `string` (required): The type of SSO.
  **Allowed values:** `Credential`, `Redirect`
- `URLs` — `[string]`: An array of URL prefixes of identity providers where the app extension performs SSO.

  Required for `Redirect` payloads. Ignored for `Credential` payloads.

  The URLs need to begin with `http://` or `https://`.

  The system:

  - Matches scheme and host name case-insensitively
  - Doesn’t allow query parameters and URL fragments
  - Requires that the URLs of all installed Extensible SSO payloads are unique

### Configuration examples

**Credential**

This configuration sets up a Credential-type SSO extension that handles authentication for hosts in the example.com domain.

```json
{
    "Type": "com.apple.configuration.extensible-sso",
    "Identifier": "EB13EE2B-5D63-4EBA-810F-5B81D07F5017",
    "ServerToken": "E180CA9A-F089-4FA3-BBDF-94CC159C4AE8",
    "Payload": {
        "ExtensionComposedIdentifier": "com.example.sso.extension (ABCDE12345)",
        "Type": "Credential",
        "Realm": "EXAMPLE.COM",
        "Hosts": [
            ".example.com"
        ],
        "ExtensionData": {
            "useSiteAutoDiscovery": true
        }
    }
}
```

**Redirect**

This configuration sets up a Redirect-type SSO extension that intercepts authentication requests to specific login URLs.

```json
{
    "Type": "com.apple.configuration.extensible-sso",
    "Identifier": "2A3B4C5D-6E7F-8A9B-0C1D-2E3F4A5B6C7D",
    "ServerToken": "F1E2D3C4-B5A6-7890-ABCD-EF1234567890",
    "Payload": {
        "ExtensionComposedIdentifier": "com.example.sso.extension",
        "Type": "Redirect",
        "URLs": [
            "https://login.example.com/auth",
            "https://sso.example.com/"
        ],
        "ScreenLockedBehavior": "Cancel"
    }
}
```
