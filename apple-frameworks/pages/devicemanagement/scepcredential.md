# SCEPCredential

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** Device Management  
**Kind:** Object  
**Availability:** iOS 17.0+ · iPadOS 17.0+ · Mac Catalyst 17.0+ · macOS 14.0+ · tvOS 17.0+ · visionOS 1.1+ · watchOS 10.0+

A SCEP identity that the device generates.

## Declaration

```
object SCEPCredential
```

## Properties

- `CAFingerprint` — `string`: The fingerprint of the Certificate Authority certificate.
- `Challenge` — `string`: A preshared secret.
- `Key Type` — `string`: The key type, which always has the value `RSA`.
  **Default:** `RSA`
- `Key Usage` — `integer`: A bitmask that specifies the use of the key: `1` is signing, `4` is encryption, and `5` is both signing and encryption. Some certificate authorities, such as Windows CA, support only encryption or signing, but not both at the same time.
  **Default:** `0`
- `Keysize` — `integer`: The key size in bits, either `1024`, `2048`, or `4096`.
  **Default:** `1024`  
  **Allowed values:** `1024`, `2048`, `4096`
- `Name` — `string`: Any string that the SCEP server recognizes. For example, it could be a domain name such as `example.org`. If a certificate authority has multiple CA certificates, you can use this field to specify the required certificate.
- `Retries` — `integer`: The number of times the device should retry if the server sends a `PENDING` response.
  **Default:** `3`
- `RetryDelay` — `integer`: The number of seconds to wait between subsequent retries. The system makes the first retry without this delay.
  **Default:** `10`
- `Subject` — `[[[string]]]`: The representation of an X.500 name is an array of OID and value. For example, `/C=US/O=Apple Inc./CN=foo/1.2.5.3=bar` corresponds to:

  `[ [ ["C", "US"] ], [ ["O", "Apple Inc."] ], [ [ "CN", "foo"] ], [ [ "1.2.5.3", "bar" ] ] ]`

  You can represent OIDs as dotted numbers or use shortcuts for country (`C`), locality (`L`), state (`ST`), organization (`O`), organizational unit (`OU`), and common name (`CN`).
- `SubjectAltName` — `SCEPCredentialSubjectAltNameObject`: The subject’s alternative name for the certificate.
- `URL` — `string` (required): The SCEP URL.
