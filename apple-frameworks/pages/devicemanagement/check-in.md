<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

The Mobile Device Management (MDM) check-in protocol validates a deviceʼs eligibility for enrollment and informs the device management service that a deviceʼs push token has been updated.

After installing the MDM payload, the device initiates communication with the check-in service. The device validates the TLS certificate of the service, then uses the identity specified in its MDM payload as the client authentication certificate for the connection.

If the MDM payload includes a check-in URL, the check-in protocol communicates with that check-in service. If it doesn’t provide a check-in URL, the device uses the main device management service URL instead.
