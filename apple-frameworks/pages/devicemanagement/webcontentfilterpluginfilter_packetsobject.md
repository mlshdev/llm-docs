  The identifier is a composed identifier. The format of the composed identifier is “Bundle-ID {Designated-Requirement}”. “Bundle-ID” is the bundle identifier string of the provider. “Designated-Requirement” is the designated requirement string the device uses to match the code signature of the provider. For example, “com.example.app {anchor apple generic}”.
