# DeviceInformationCommand.Command

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** Device Management  
**Kind:** Device Management Command  
**Availability:** iOS 4.0+ · iPadOS 4.0+ · Mac Catalyst 4.0+ · macOS 10.7+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.1+ · watchOS 10.0+

The command to get detailed information about a device.

## Declaration

```
object DeviceInformationCommand.Command
```

## Properties

- `DeviceAttestationNonce` — `data`: A freshness code that appears in the resulting attestation. This value can contain up to 32 bytes of data. If specified, queries need to contain `DevicePropertiesAttestation`.

  The MDM server uses this value to prove that an attestation was recently generated. The system caches the most recently generated attestation on the device. If omitted or if the value matches the cached attestation, the system returns the cached attestation. To request a new attestation, provide a new freshness code. Requests for new attestations are rate limited. If it’s fewer than 7 days since the system generated an attestation, the device returns the cached attestation rather than generating a new one.

  See the hardware requirements for attestation below.

  Available: iOS 16+ | iPadOS 16+ | macOS 14+ | tvOS 16+ | visionOS 1.1+ | watchOS 10+
