**Interface language:** Data

**Kind:** Object  
**Availability:** VPP License Management 1.0+

The response with the licenses.

## Declaration

```
object GetVppLicensesResponse
```

## Properties

- `batchCount` — `int32`: The number of licenses returned in the current batch.

  See [Handle batched responses](retrieving-a-large-record-set.md#Handle-batched-responses) for more information.
- `batchToken` — `string`: Use this value in subsequent requests to get the next batch. The server generates the `batchToken` value, and it can be several kilobytes in size. For an initial request that doesn’t include `batchToken`, a `batchToken` value returns if the number of results exceeds a server-controlled limit. Subsequent requests must include `batchToken`. As long as additional batches remain, the server returns a new `batchToken` value in its response.

  See [Handle batched responses](retrieving-a-large-record-set.md#Handle-batched-responses) for more information.
- `clientContext` — `string`: The value currently associated with the provided `sToken`. This field is only included in the response when a value is set with the [Client Configuration](client-configuration.md) endpoint.
- `errorMessage` — `string`: The human-readable explanation of the error.
- `errorNumber` — `int32`: The numeric code of the error.
- `expirationMillis` — `int64`: The UNIX epoch timestamp, in milliseconds, when the account’s `sToken` or password expires (whichever is earlier).
- `licenses` — `[VppLicense]`: A list of licenses managed by the provided `sToken`.
- `location` — `VppLocation`: The location associated with the provided `sToken`. This field only returns when using a location token with an Apple School Manager account.
- `sinceModifiedToken` — `string`: A token that marks a place in time. After all licenses return for a request, the server includes a `sinceModifiedToken` value in the response. Use it in subsequent requests to get licenses modified after generating the token.

  See [Track changes](retrieving-a-large-record-set.md#Track-changes) for more information.
- `status` — `int32`: The status code for the response. Possible values are:

  `0` = Success.

  `-1` = Failure.
- `totalBatchCount` — `int32`: The total number of round trips needed to get the complete result set.

  See [Handle batched responses](retrieving-a-large-record-set.md#Handle-batched-responses) for more information.
- `totalCount` — `int32`: An estimate of the total number of licenses that will return. This value returns only for requests that don’t include `batchToken`, and only for the request that starts the batch process. The actual number of licenses that return can be different by the time the client finishes retrieving all licenses.
- `uId` — `string`: The unique library identifier. When querying records using multiple tokens that may share libraries, use the `uId` field to filter duplicates. In this way, you can avoid double-counting records when duplicate tokens are uploaded by different content managers.
