## Declaration

```
object ManageVppLicensesByAdamIdResponse
```

## Properties

- `adamIdStr` — `string`: The unique identifier for a product in the iTunes Store.
- `associations` — `[VppAssociation]`: An array of dictionaries representing successful and failed associations. If an association succeeds, its dictionary contains the license and either a client-user ID or the serial number of the device associated with the license. If an association fails, its dictionary contains the error message and number, and either the client-user ID or the serial number of the device that couldn’t be associated with the license.
- `clientContext` — `string`: The value currently associated with the provided `sToken`. This field is only included in the response when a value is set with the [Client Configuration](client-configuration.md) endpoint.
- `disassociations` — `[VppAssociation]`: An array of dictionaries representing successful and failed disassociations. If a disassociation succeeds, its dictionary contains a license and either a client-user ID or the serial number of the device disassociated. The license may not be the license ID that was just disassociated; the license ID is any currently available license at the time of disassociation. If the disassociation fails, its dictionary contains the error message and number, and either the client-user ID or the serial number of the device that couldn’t be disassociated from the license.
- `errorMessage` — `string`: The human-readable explanation of the error.
- `errorNumber` — `int32`: The numeric code of the error.
- `expirationMillis` — `int64`: The UNIX epoch timestamp, in milliseconds, when the account’s sToken or password expires (whichever is earlier).
- `isIrrevocable` — `boolean`: If `true`, licenses for the specified product can’t be revoked and reassigned.
- `location` — `VppLocation`: The location associated with the provided sToken. This field is only returned when a location token is used with an Apple School Manager account.
- `pricingParam` — `string`: The quality of a product in the iTunes Store. Possible values are:

  STDQ: Standard quality

  PLUS: High quality
- `productTypeId` — `int32`: The type of a product. Possible values are:

  7 = macOS software

  8 = iOS or macOS app from the App Store

  10 = Book
- `productTypeName` — `string`: The name of the product type.
- `status` — `int32`: The status code for the response. Possible values are:

  `0` = Success. All requested associations and disassociations have succeeded.

  -1 = Failure. All requested associations and disassociations failed. An `errorNumber`, ` errorCode`, and `errorMessage` return for each failed association and disassociation. See [VppAssociation](vppassociation.md) for more information.

  `-3` = The licenses can’t be changed as requested. Some of the requested associations and disassociations succeeded and others failed. An `errorNumber`, `errorCode`, and `errorMessage` return for each failed association and disassociation. See [VppAssociation](vppassociation.md) for more information.
- `uId` — `string`: The unique library identifier. When querying records using multiple tokens that may share libraries, use the `uId` field to filter duplicates. In this way, you can avoid double-counting records when duplicate tokens are uploaded by different content managers.
