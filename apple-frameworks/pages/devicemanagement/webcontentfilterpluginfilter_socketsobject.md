Settings that control the socket filter. If not present, the system doesn’t use socket filtering.

## Declaration

```
object WebContentFilterPluginFilter_SocketsObject
```

## Properties

- `Enabled` — `boolean` (required): If `true`, enables the filtering of socket traffic.
- `ProviderComposedIdentifier` — `string`: The data provider identifier. This string identifies the filter data provider when the filter starts running. Required when Enabled is true.

  In iOS and visionOS, the identifier is a bundle ID, for example, “com.example.app”.

  In macOS, the identifier is a composed identifier. The format of the composed identifier is “Bundle-ID {Designated-Requirement}”. “Bundle-ID” is the bundle identifier string of the provider. “Designated-Requirement” is the designated requirement string the device uses to match the code signature of the provider. For example, “com.example.app {anchor apple generic}”.
