# RestartDeviceCommand.Command

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** Device Management  
**Kind:** Device Management Command  
**Availability:** iOS 10.3+ · iPadOS 10.3+ · Mac Catalyst 10.3+ · macOS 10.13+ · tvOS 10.2+

The command to remotely and immediately restart a device.

## Declaration

```
object RestartDeviceCommand.Command
```

## Properties

- `KextPaths` — `[string]`: If `RebuildKernelCache` is `true`, this value specifies the paths to kexts to add to the auxiliary kernel cache since the last kernel cache rebuild. If not present, the system only adds previously discovered kexts to the kernel cache.

  Available: macOS 11+
- `NotifyUser` — `boolean`: If `true`, notifies the user to restart the device at their convenience. No forced restart occurs unless the device is at `loginwindow` with no logged-in users. The user can dismiss the notification and ignore the request. No further notifications display unless you resend the command.

  Available: macOS 11.4+  
  **Default:** `false`
- `RebuildKernelCache` — `boolean`: If `true`, the system rebuilds the kernel cache during a device restart. If `BootstrapTokenAllowedForAuthentication` is `true` in the [SecurityInfoResponse.SecurityInfo](../securityinforesponse/securityinfo-data.dictionary.md) response, the device requests the bootstrap token from the MDM server prior to executing this command.

  Available: macOS 11+  
  **Default:** `false`
- `RequestRequiresNetworkTether` — `boolean`: If `true`, the device needs to be network-tethered to run the command.
  **Default:** `false`
- `RequestType` — `string` (required): The request type for this command.
  **Allowed values:** `RestartDevice`
