## Discussion

This endpoint returns the original device serial number and replacement date for a replacement device. Call this endpoint only when the device’s `is_replacement_device` field is `true` in the response from [Get a List of Devices](fetch-devices.md), [Sync the List of Devices](sync-devices.md), or [Get Device Details](device-details.md). Calling it for a device whose `is_replacement_device` value is `false` returns HTTP 404 `DEVICE_NOT_FOUND`.

This request requires `X-Server-Protocol-Version` 10 or later.
