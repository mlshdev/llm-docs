# ServicesBackgroundTasks

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** Device Management  
**Kind:** Object  
**Availability:** macOS 15.0+

The declaration to configure background tasks.

## Declaration

```
object ServicesBackgroundTasks
```

## Properties

- `ExecutableAssetReference` — `string`: Specifies the identifier of an asset declaration containing a reference to the files to be used for the background task configuration. The corresponding asset must be of type `com.apple.asset.data`.

  The referenced data must be a zip archive of an entire directory that the device expands and stores in a well known location for the background task. The asset’s “ContentType” and “Hash-SHA-256” keys in the “Reference” key are required.

  This zip archive should contain background task executables, scripts, and configuration files, but not the `launchd` configuration files.

  The device stores the expanded zip archive in the tamper-proof `/var/db/ManagedConfigurationFiles/BackgroundTaskServices/Services/<TaskType>` directory, where `<TaskType>` is the value of the `TaskType` key in the configuration.
- `LaunchdConfigurations` — `[ServicesBackgroundTasksLaunchdItemObject]`: An array of `launchd` configuration files used to run the background tasks.

  The device stores the configuration files in the tamper-proof `/var/db/ManagedConfigurationFiles/BackgroundTaskServices/LaunchDaemons` or `/var/db/ManagedConfigurationFiles/BackgroundTaskServices/LaunchAgents` directories, based on the `Context` value for each item.
- `TaskDescription` — `string`: A description of the set of background tasks this configuration manages.
- `TaskType` — `string` (required): The unique identifier of the set of background tasks managed with this configuration. This should be a reverse DNS style identifier. The device uses this identifier to differentiate between tasks in different configurations.

## Discussion

Specify `com.apple.configuration.services.background-tasks` as the declaration type.

One or both of `ExecutableAssetReference` or `LaunchdConfigurations` needs to be present.

If `ExecutableAssetReference` is present, the POSIX permissions of the files in the zip archive need to be set correctly. For example, executables must have the “x” bit set.

If `LaunchdConfigurations` is present, the device stores the launchd configuration files in a secure location and loads them into launchd. When the device updates a launchd configuration, it kills and restarts any associated running tasks.

If both `ExecutableAssetReference` and `LaunchdConfigurations` are present, and the device changes just the executable data, it kills and restarts any running tasks associated with the launchd configurations.

> **Note**

>  If an executable is an app, the device can’t manage the app as it can only manage apps installed in `/Applications`. Also, the device can’t use system extensions in the app as it only loads them from apps installed in `/Applications`.
