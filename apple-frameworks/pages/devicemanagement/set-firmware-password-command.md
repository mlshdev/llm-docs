## Discussion

This command has a throttle interval to prevent executing it more frequently than every 30 seconds. Requests that occur within the throttle interval return an error.

> **Important**

>  There’s no way to set or clear a firmware password in MDM without knowing the current password, unless the server provides a way to prompt the administrator for the current password. Contact AppleCare service and support if the current password is unknown.

After processing the command, the device restarts so that the new firmware password takes effect. This command returns an error and fails if a firmware password is already pending.
