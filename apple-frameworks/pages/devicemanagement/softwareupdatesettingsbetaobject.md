**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** Device Management  
**Kind:** Object  
**Availability:** iOS 18.0+ · iPadOS 18.0+ · Mac Catalyst 18.0+ · macOS 15.4+

This object configures the beta program settings for a device.

## Declaration

```
object SoftwareUpdateSettingsBetaObject
```

## Properties

- `OfferPrograms` — `[SoftwareUpdateSettingsBeta_ProgramObject]`: An array of beta programs allowed on the device. This key must only be present if the `ProgramEnrollment` key is set to `Allowed` or `AlwaysOn`. This key must not be present if the `RequireProgram` key is present. This key can be present on unsupervised devices where the `ProgramEnrollment` key isn’t supported but is implicitly set to `Allowed`.
- `ProgramEnrollment` — `string`: Specifies whether the user can control beta program enrollment in the software update settings UI:

  - `Allowed` \- the user can enroll in any applicable beta programs associated with their logged in Apple Account. If the `OfferPrograms` key is present, then the programs listed in that key are also presented to the user.
  - `AlwaysOn` \- the device uses the beta programs the organization specifies, and the user isn’t able to enroll in a beta program using their logged in Apple Account. The device is automatically enrolled into the beta program specified by the `RequireProgram` key if it’s present. Otherwise, the system presents the programs listed in the `OfferPrograms` key to the user to choose which to enroll with.
  - `AlwaysOff` \- The device isn’t allowed to enroll in any beta programs. The system removes the device from any beta programs, if already enrolled.

  Allowed enrollments: supervised  
  **Default:** `Allowed`  
  **Allowed values:** `Allowed`, `AlwaysOn`, `AlwaysOff`
- `RequireProgram` — `SoftwareUpdateSettingsBeta_RequireProgramObject`: The device automatically enrolls in this beta program. This key must only be present if the `ProgramEnrollment` key is set to `AlwaysOn`. The `OfferPrograms` key must not be present if this key is present.

  Allowed enrollments: supervised
