# NetworkDNSSettings

**Interface language:** Data

The declaration to configure encrypted DNS settings.

## Declaration

```
object NetworkDNSSettings
```

## Properties

- `DNSSettings` — `NetworkDNSSettingsDNSSettingsObject` (required): A dictionary that defines a configuration for an encrypted DNS server.
- `OnDemandRules` — `[NetworkDNSSettingsOnDemandRulesElementObject]`: An array of rules that define the DNS settings. If not set, the system always applies the DNS settings. These rules are identical to the `OnDemandRules` array in VPN payloads.
- `ProhibitDisablement` — `boolean`: If `true`, the system prohibits users from disabling DNS settings.

  Allowed enrollments: supervised  
  **Default:** `false`
- `VisibleName` — `string` (required): The name of the DNS settings that the system displays on the device.

## Discussion

Specify `com.apple.configuration.network.dns-settings` as the declaration type.

The following rules determine which networks the settings apply to:

- For supervised enrollments, the settings apply to all networks.
- For device enrollments, the settings are limited to only managed networks.
- For local installs, the settings apply to all networks.
