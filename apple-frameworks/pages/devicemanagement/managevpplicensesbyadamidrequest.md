**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** Device Management  
**Kind:** Object  
**Availability:** VPP License Management 1.0+

The request to manage licenses.

## Declaration

```
object ManageVppLicensesByAdamIdRequest
```

## Properties

- `adamIdStr` — `string` (required): The unique identifier for a product in the iTunes Store.
- `associateClientUserIdStrs` — `[string]`: An array of client-user IDs to associate licenses with.

  When passing a value for `associateClientUserIdStrs`, you may not also pass a value for `associateSerialNumbers`.
- `associateSerialNumbers` — `[string]`: An array of device serial numbers to associate licenses with.

  When passing a value for `associateSerialNumbers`, you may not also pass a value for `associateClientUserIdStrs`.
- `disassociateClientUserIdStrs` — `[string]`: An array of client-user IDs to disassociate licenses from.

  When passing a value for `disassociateClientUserIdStrs`, you may not also pass a value for `disassociateLicenseIdStrs` or `disassociateSerialNumbers`.
- `disassociateLicenseIdStrs` — `[string]`: An array of license IDs to disassociate from the user ID or device.

  When passing a value for `disassociateLicenseIdStrs`, you may not also pass a value for `disassociateClientUserIdStrs` or `disassociateSerialNumbers`.
- `disassociateSerialNumbers` — `[string]`: An array of device serial numbers to disassociate licenses from.

  When passing a value for `disassociateSerialNumbers`, you may not also pass a value for `disassociateClientUserIdStrs` or `disassociateLicenseIdStrs`.
- `notifyDisassociation` — `boolean`: If `true`, sends notifications when licenses are disassociated. The default is `true`.
- `pricingParam` — `string`: The quality of a product in the iTunes Store. The default is `STDQ`.  Possible values are:

  - `STDQ`: Standard quality
  - `PLUS`: High quality

  When assigning licenses for books, it is especially important to pass the correct `pricingParam` to the request, so the correct version of the product is assigned. The [Get Assets](get-assets-44p83.md) endpoint will return the correct `pricingParam` for the purchased version of the book. If an organization purchases both the standard-quality and high-quality versions of a book, [Get Assets](get-assets-44p83.md) will return two records with the same `adamId` but different pricingParams.
- `sToken` — `string` (required): The authentication token. For more information, see [Authenticate with the web service](managing-apps-and-books-through-web-services-legacy.md#Authenticate-with-the-web-service).

## Discussion

The maximum number of entries allowed in the `associate*` and `disassociate*` arrays are indicated by the `maxBatchAssociateLicenseCount` or `maxBatchDisassociateLicenseCount` fields available from the [Service Configuration](service-configuration.md) response.

Requests that exceed the current limits are rejected with the error code 9602 “Invalid Argument” and no work is done. If you receive this error code, query the [Service Configuration](service-configuration.md) endpoint to retrieve new `maxBatchAssociateLicenseCount` and `maxBatchDisassociateLicenseCount` values, correct the last request that was rejected, and resend the request.
