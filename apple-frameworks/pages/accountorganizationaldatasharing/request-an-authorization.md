# Request an authorization

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** Account & Organizational Data Sharing  
**Kind:** Web Endpoint  
**Availability:** AccountOrganizationalDataSharing 1.0+

Request a user authorization to Account & Organizational Data Sharing apps and web services.

## URL

```http
GET https://appleid.apple.com/auth/oauth2/v2/authorize
```

## Query Parameters

- `client_id` — `string` (required): The identifier (App ID or Services ID) for your app. To prevent exposing sensitive data to the end user, don’t include your Team ID in the identifier.
- `nonce` — `string`: A unique, single-use string that your app provides to associate a client session with the user’s identity token. This value also prevents replay attacks, and correlates the initial authentication request to the identity token provided in the authorization response.
- `redirect_uri` — `string` (required): The destination URI associated with your app that the authorization redirects. The URI must use the HTTPS protocol, include a domain name, can’t be an IP address or `localhost`, and must not contain a fragment identifer (`#`).
- `response_mode` — `string`:
- `response_type` — `string` (required): The type of response requested. Use the value `code`.
- `scope` — `string` (required): The amount of personal information your app or web service requests from Apple’s servers. Valid values are `edu.users.read` and `edu.classes.read`. You can request one, both, or none. Use space separation and percent-encoding for multiple scopes; for example, `"scope=edu.users.read%20edu.classes.read"`.
- `state` — `string`: An arbitrary string that your app provides to represent the current state of the authorization request. This value mitigates cross-site request forgery attacks by comparing against the state value contained in the authorization response.

## Response Codes

- `200` OK: The request was successful.
- `404` Not Found: Resource not found.
