# Token revocation

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** Account & Organizational Data Sharing  
**Kind:** Web Endpoint  
**Availability:** AccountOrganizationalDataSharing 1.0+

Invalidate the tokens and associated user authorizations for someone when they are no longer associated with your app.

## URL

```http
POST https://appleid.apple.com/auth/oauth2/v2/revoke
```

## HTTP Body

Content type: `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`

Type: `form-data`

The list of input parameters required for the server to invalidate the token.

## Body parameters

- `client_id` — `string` (required): The identifier (App ID or Services ID) for your app. The identifier must match the value provided during the authorization request for the person’s information. To help mitigate the possibility of exposing sensitive data to the end user, the identifier must not include your Team ID.
- `client_secret` — `string` (required): A secret JWT that uses the Account and Organizational Data Sharing private key associated with your developer account. For more information about creating client secrets, see [Generate and validate tokens](generate-and-validate-tokens.md).
- `token` — `string` (required): The user refresh token or access token intended to be revoked. If the request is successful, revoke the user session associated with the provided token.
- `token_type_hint` — `string`: A hint about the type of the token submitted for revocation. Use `refresh_token` or `access_token`.

## Response Codes

- `200` OK: The request was successful; the provided token has been revoked successfully or was previously invalid.
- `400` Bad Request — `ErrorResponse`: The server was unable to process the request. See the error code description for more information about the underlying error.

## Overview

To revoke authorization for a user, you must obtain a valid refresh token or access token. If you don’t have either token for the user, you can generate tokens when validating an authorization code. For more information about user tokens and creating client secrets, see [Generate and validate tokens](generate-and-validate-tokens.md).

To invalidate a user’s refresh token, invoke the revoke endpoint with the following `HTTP POST` method:

```sh
curl -v POST "https://appleid.apple.com/auth/oauth2/v2/revoke" \
-H 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
-d 'client_id=CLIENT_ID' \
-d 'client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET' \
-d 'token=REFRESH_TOKEN' \
-d 'token_type_hint=refresh_token'
```

Additionally, to invalidate a user’s access token, use the following `HTTP POST` method:

```sh
curl -v POST "https://appleid.apple.com/auth/oauth2/v2/revoke" \
-H 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
-d 'client_id=CLIENT_ID' \
-d 'client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET' \
-d 'token=ACCESS_TOKEN' \
-d 'token_type_hint=access_token'
```

For either token revocation request, the revoke endpoint returns a `200` response code without a response body after the server invalidates the `token` value, or if the token was previously invalidated. If the server encounters an error, it returns an [ErrorResponse](errorresponse.md) that identifies the problem.
