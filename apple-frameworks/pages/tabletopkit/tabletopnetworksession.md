# TabletopNetworkSession

**Framework:** TabletopKit  
**Kind:** Class  
**Availability:** visionOS 2.0+

An object that coordinates network-related tasks in multiplayer games.

## Declaration

```swift
class TabletopNetworkSession<Coordinator> where Coordinator : TabletopNetworkSessionCoordinator
```

## Overview

To start a multiplayer game for a local player, use the [start()](tabletopnetworksession/start%28%29.md) method. TabletopKit syncs the current table state between all peers in the session, so update the table state before invoking this method.

After invoking the [start()](tabletopnetworksession/start%28%29.md) method, the local player becomes the arbiter who ensures that TabletopKit applies actions in order for all players. To switch the arbiter role between players, use the [becomeArbiter()](tabletopnetworksession/becomearbiter%28%29.md) and [followArbiter(\_:)](tabletopnetworksession/followarbiter%28__%29.md) methods.

To join an existing game, use the [join()](tabletopnetworksession/join%28%29.md) method, and to pass incoming messages to the game, use the [processIncomingMessage(\_:from:)](tabletopnetworksession/processincomingmessage%28__from_%29.md) method.

To get all the people who join the session, not just the players, use the [peers](tabletopnetworksession/peers.md) property.

## Topics

### Joining multiplayer games

- [start()](tabletopnetworksession/start%28%29.md): Start a new multiplayer game, promoting the local state of the table to all connected peers
- [join()](tabletopnetworksession/join%28%29.md): Join an existing game started between the connected peers
- [leave()](tabletopnetworksession/leave%28%29.md): Leave the current multiplayer game
- [terminate()](tabletopnetworksession/terminate%28%29.md)

### Changing the arbiter role between players

- [becomeArbiter()](tabletopnetworksession/becomearbiter%28%29.md)
- [followArbiter(\_:)](tabletopnetworksession/followarbiter%28__%29.md)

### Managing network session peers

- [peers](tabletopnetworksession/peers.md): The set of peers known by the game
- [addPeer(\_:)](tabletopnetworksession/addpeer%28__%29.md): Notify the game that a new peer has connected
- [removePeer(\_:)](tabletopnetworksession/removepeer%28__%29.md): Notify the game that an existing peer disconnected
- [TabletopNetworkSession.Peer](tabletopnetworksession/peer.md)

### Receiving messages from peers

- [processIncomingMessage(\_:from:)](tabletopnetworksession/processincomingmessage%28__from_%29.md): Pass incoming messages from the reliable channel to the game.
- [processIncomingUnreliableMessage(\_:from:)](tabletopnetworksession/processincomingunreliablemessage%28__from_%29.md): Pass incoming messages from the unreliable channel to the game.
