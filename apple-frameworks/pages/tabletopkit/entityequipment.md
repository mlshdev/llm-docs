# EntityEquipment

**Framework:** TabletopKit  
**Kind:** Protocol  
**Availability:** visionOS 2.0+

A protocol for equipment in a game that you render using RealityKit.

## Declaration

```swift
protocol EntityEquipment : Equipment
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

To render equipment using an entity, follow these steps:

1. Create a structure that conforms to this protocol.
2. Depending on the type of equipment, set the [State](equipment/state.md) type alias to either [BaseEquipmentState](baseequipmentstate.md), [DieState](diestate.md), or [CardState](cardstate.md).
3. Declare the `id` property as a [EquipmentIdentifier](equipmentidentifier.md) structure.
4. Declare the [initialState](equipment/initialstate.md) property as a [State](equipment/state.md) structure.
5. Implement an initializer that sets these properties and the [entity](entityequipment/entity.md) property.

```swift
struct Piece: EntityEquipment {
    typealias State = BaseEquipmentState

    var id: EquipmentIdentifier
    var entity: Entity
    var initialState: State

    @MainActor
    init(index: Int = 0, position: TableVisualState.Point2D) {
        id = .piece(index)
        entity = try! ModelEntity.load(named: "chess/queen", in: contentBundle)
        initialState = State(parentID: .table, pose: .init(position: position, rotation: .init()), entity: entity)
    }
}
```

Optionally, implement the [layoutChildren(for:visualState:)](equipment/layoutchildren%28for_visualstate_%29.md) method for equipment that represents groups, and the [restingOrientation(state:)](equipment/restingorientation%28state_%29.md) method to provide a custom resting position. For example, implement the [restingOrientation(state:)](equipment/restingorientation%28state_%29.md) method to flip a card face down in a card game:

```swift
func restingOrientation(state: State) -> Rotation3D {
    state.faceUp ? .identity : .init(angle: .init(degrees: +180), axis: .init(x: 0, y: 0, z: 1))
}
```
