# toss(equipmentID:as:linearVelocity:angularVelocity:)

**Framework:** TabletopKit  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** visionOS 2.0+

Begins a simulation of a toss of the equipment with the specificied parameters. Equipment that begins a toss in the same TabletopInteraction may interact with each other as well as the game’s boundary.

## Declaration

```swift
func toss(equipmentID: EquipmentIdentifier, as representation: TossableRepresentation, linearVelocity: Vector3D? = nil, angularVelocity: Vector3D? = nil)
```

## Parameters

- `equipmentID`: The equipment ID to use in the toss simulation.
- `representation`: The representation that the toss simulation will treat the equipment as.
- `linearVelocity`: The linear velocity the toss begins with. If nil, the simulation will use the interaction’s current linear velocity.
- `angularVelocity`: The angular velocity the toss begins with. If nil, the simulation will use the interaction’s current angular velocity.

### Performing actions

- [TabletopInteraction.Delegate](delegate.md): A protocol for objects that manage the entire flow of players interacting with equipment.
- [TabletopInteraction.TossOutcome](tossoutcome.md): An object representing the final outcome of tossing one equipment, as it appears at the end of its simulation.
- [addAction(\_:)](addaction%28__%29-1cety.md): Submit an action tied to this interaction. If the interaction gets canceled, all the associated actions will be automatically rolled back.
- [addAction(\_:)](addaction%28__%29-4rx16.md): Submit a custom action tied to this interaction. If the interaction gets canceled, all the associated actions will be automatically rolled back.
- [addActions(\_:)](addactions%28__%29.md): Submit a collection of actions tied to this interaction. If the interaction gets canceled, all the associated actions will be automatically rolled back.
- [end()](end%28%29.md): Ends the current interaction.
- [cancel()](cancel%28%29.md): Cancels the current interaction. All actions added to the interaction will also be cancelled.
