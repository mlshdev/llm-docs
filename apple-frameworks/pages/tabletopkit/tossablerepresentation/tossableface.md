# TossableRepresentation.TossableFace

**Framework:** TabletopKit  
**Kind:** Protocol  
**Availability:** visionOS 26.0+

A protocol that represents a face of a tossable shape.

## Declaration

```swift
protocol TossableFace : RawRepresentable where Self.RawValue == UInt64
```

## Topics

### Creating a tossable face

- [init(restingOrientation:)](tossableface/init%28restingorientation_%29.md): Constructs the face in contact with the table when the equipment has the given resting orientation. If the resting orientation is an unexpected rotation, constructs the face corresponding to the closest expected orientation.

### Getting the orientation

- [restingOrientation](tossableface/restingorientation.md): Provides the resting orientation for when this face is in contact with the table.
