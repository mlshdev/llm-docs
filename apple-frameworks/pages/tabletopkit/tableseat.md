# TableSeat

**Framework:** TabletopKit  
**Kind:** Protocol  
**Availability:** visionOS 2.0+

A protocol for seats at the table that players occupy.

## Declaration

```swift
protocol TableSeat : Identifiable where Self.ID == TableSeatIdentifier
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

To represent seats in your game, follow these steps:

1. Create a structure that conforms to this protocol.
2. Set the [State](tableseat/state.md) type alias to [TableSeatState](tableseatstate.md).
3. Declare the `id` property as a [TableSeatIdentifier](tableseatidentifier.md) structure.
4. Declare the [initialState](tableseat/initialstate.md) property as a [State](tableseat/state.md) structure.
5. Implement an initializer that sets these properties.

```swift
struct Seat: TableSeat {
    typealias State = TableSeatState
    var id: TableSeatIdentifier
    var initialState: State

    init(index: Int = 0, position: TableVisualState.Point2D) {
        id = .seat(index)
        initialState = .init(pose: .init(position: position, rotation: .init()))
    }
}
```

Then add the seats to the [TableSetup](tablesetup.md) object using one of its add methods. For example, use the [add(seat:)](tablesetup/add%28seat_%29-a9qw.md) method to specify a position for the seat.

```swift
var setup = TableSetup(tabletop: table)
setup.add(seat: Seat(index: 0, position: .init(x: 0, z: -0.5)))
```

To render seats using RealityKit, conform to the [EntityTableSeat](entitytableseat.md) protocol instead.
