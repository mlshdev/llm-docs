# ImpulseAction

**Framework:** RealityKit  
**Kind:** Structure  
**Availability:** iOS 18.0+ · iPadOS 18.0+ · Mac Catalyst 18.0+ · macOS 15.0+ · tvOS 26.0+ · visionOS 2.0+

An action that applies an impulse to the physics body at its center of mass when played as an animation.

## Declaration

```swift
struct ImpulseAction
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

This action requires a [CollisionComponent](collisioncomponent.md) and [PhysicsBodyComponent](physicsbodycomponent.md) with the [mode](physicsbodycomponent/mode.md) set to [PhysicsBodyMode.dynamic](physicsbodymode/dynamic.md). Without these settings, the impulse has no effect on the entity.

The example below creates an animation which applies an impulse to the entity after five seconds.

```swift
// Create an action to apply an impulse, forcing the object to move upwards.
let impulseAction = ImpulseAction(linearImpulse: [0, 1, 0])

// Create a small positive duration value.
let duration: TimeInterval = 1 / 30.0

// Create an animation for the action, which will start playing
// after five seconds.
let impulseAnimation = try AnimationResource
    .makeActionAnimation(for: impulseAction,
                         duration: duration,
                         delay: 5.0)

// Play the sequence animation that will play the actions.
entity.playAnimation(impulseAnimation)
```

> **Important**

> This action does not directly animate a bound property, such as [BindTarget.transform](bindtarget/transform.md).

> **Tip**

> This action performs instantaneously, consider supplying a small positive duration value when creating the animation.
