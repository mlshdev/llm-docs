# BlendShapeWeightsComponent

**Framework:** RealityKit  
**Kind:** Structure  
**Availability:** iOS 18.0+ · iPadOS 18.0+ · Mac Catalyst 18.0+ · macOS 15.0+ · tvOS 26.0+ · visionOS 2.0+

A component that provides access to the current weights associated with all blend shape meshes on an entity.

## Declaration

```swift
struct BlendShapeWeightsComponent
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

You can access the weights associated with an entity’s blend shapes by using the [weightSet](blendshapeweightscomponent/weightset.md) variable after an initialized `BlendShapeWeightsComponent` is added to an entity.

```swift
let blendShapeWeightsComponent = BlendShapeWeightsComponent(
    weightsMapping: weightsMapping)
entity.components.set(blendShapeWeightsComponent)
let weightValues = BlendShapeWeights([0.3, 0.8])
entity.components[BlendShapeWeightsComponent.self]!.weightSets[0].weights =
    weightValues
```

## Topics

### Initializers

- [init(weightsMapping:)](blendshapeweightscomponent/init%28weightsmapping_%29.md): Create a BlendShapeWeightsComponent from a BlendShapeWeightsMapping.

### Instance Properties

- [weightSet](blendshapeweightscomponent/weightset.md): The runtime named blend shapes weights.

- [BlendShapeWeights](blendshapeweights.md): A set of animatable weight values that collectively represent the blending amounts for all the blend shapes’ blend targets.
