The shadow-filtering algorithm this light uses.

## Declaration

## Discussion

Set to [medium](qualitymode/medium.md) or [high](qualitymode/high.md) to opt the light into soft shadows, whose penumbra widens with [lightSize](lightsize.md) and with the distance between the caster and the receiving surface. The default value is [low](qualitymode/low.md), which produces a hard-edged shadow whose appearance is independent of [lightSize](lightsize.md).

Higher quality modes use more samples per shadow, which increases GPU work. Excessive use of higher shadow quality lights may contribute to user-noticeable frame drops and can cause the device to heat up in graphically demanding scenes. Monitor the thermal state to lower quality as a mitigation, if necessary. Apps can monitor thermal state changes by subscribing to the [thermalStateDidChange](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/notificationcenter/messageidentifier/thermalstatedidchange) notification.

To stay responsive to the device’s available thermal headroom, read `ProcessInfo.processInfo.thermalState` and observe `ProcessInfo.thermalStateDidChangeNotification` to react when it changes. As the reported state moves from `.fair` toward `.serious` and `.critical` switch the light to a lower quality.
