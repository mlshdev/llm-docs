# BlendShapeWeightsSet

**Framework:** RealityKit  
**Kind:** Structure  
**Availability:** iOS 18.0+ · iPadOS 18.0+ · Mac Catalyst 18.0+ · macOS 15.0+ · tvOS 26.0+ · visionOS 2.0+

A custom collection of named blend shape weights.

## Declaration

```swift
struct BlendShapeWeightsSet
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Retrieve a `BlendShapeWeightsSet` from a [BlendShapeWeightsComponent](blendshapeweightscomponent.md) to access the current weights and weight names for each blend shape managed by the component.

Set the current weights for a blend shape by assigning a `BlendShapeWeightsSet` to a [BlendShapeWeightsComponent](blendshapeweightscomponent.md) for a specific blend shape.

The collection allows:

- Access to elements by name.
- Protection that prohibits updating an element, where such an update would try to rename the stored element.

[BlendShapeWeightsSet](blendshapeweightsset.md) does not support addition/removal of elements, as the blend shape weights are defined in the asset and the number and names of the weights are immutable.

## Topics

### Initializers

- [init()](blendshapeweightsset/init%28%29.md): Creates an empty set.

### Instance Properties

- [count](blendshapeweightsset/count.md): Number of blend shape weight data in the set.
- [default](blendshapeweightsset/default.md): The blend shape weights data set that drives the model.
- [isEmpty](blendshapeweightsset/isempty.md): Checks if the set contains any blend shape weights data.

### Instance Methods

- [contains(\_:)](blendshapeweightsset/contains%28__%29.md): Checks if the set contains a blend shape weights data instance with the given name.
- [index(of:)](blendshapeweightsset/index%28of_%29.md): Returns the index where the specified blend shape weights data appears in the collection.
- [set(\_:)](blendshapeweightsset/set%28__%29.md): Updates a blend shape weights data instance in the set based on its name. If blend shape weights data with this ID does not exist, does nothing.

### Subscripts

- [subscript(\_:)](blendshapeweightsset/subscript%28__%29.md): Accessor for reading a blend shape weights data in the set.
