# emissiveColor

**Framework:** RealityKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property

The color of light this material emits.

## Declaration

var emissiveColor: CustomMaterial.EmissiveColor { get set }
```

## Discussion

With physically based rendering (PBR), you can give entities in RealityKit the appearance of emitting light. Use this property to simulate real-world objects that glow, such as objects with LEDs or computer screens. To enable light emission from a material, set [emissiveIntensity](../physicallybasedmaterial/emissiveintensity.md) to a value greater than zero, then specify a color (other than black) using this property. You can specify a single emissive color for the entire material, or use a UV-mapped image texture to use different colors for different parts of the entity.

With custom materials, RealityKit doesn’t use [emissiveColor](emissivecolor-swift.property.md) automatically to render your entity. Call `params.surface().set_emissive_color()` from your surface shader, otherwise RealityKit renders no light emission.

The following example assigns a tint color to the [emissiveColor](../physicallybasedmaterial/emissivecolor-swift.property.md) property, without a texture:

```swift
self.emissiveColor = PhysicallyBasedMaterial.EmissiveColor(color: .red)
```

This next example uses a texture to specify the [emissiveColor](../physicallybasedmaterial/emissivecolor-swift.property.md) property:

```swift
if let emissiveResource = try? TextureResource.load(named: "entity_emissive") {
    let emissiveMap = MaterialParameters.Texture(emissiveResource)
    material.emissiveColor = .init(texture: emissiveMap)
}
```

This Metal code shows how to access the emissive color tint in your shader functions:

```cpp
half3 emissiveTint = (half3)params.material_constants().emissive_color();
```

The following Metal code demonstrates how to sample the emissive color texture for the current fragment:

```cpp
// Get the entity's primary texture coordinates.
float2 uv = params.geometry().uv0();

// Flip the y-axis. You only need to do this for entities you load from
// USDZ or .reality files.
uv.y = 1.0 - uv.y;

// Sample the emissive color texture to get the value for this fragment.
auto tex = params.textures();
half3 emissiveColor = (half3)tex.emissive_color()
    .sample(textureSampler, uv).rgb;
```
