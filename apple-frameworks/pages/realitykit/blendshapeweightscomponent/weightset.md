## Discussion

Initialize the `weightSet` variable using the [init()](../blendshapeweightsset/init%28%29.md) function.

The `weightSet` variable has the following limitations as to how it can be set:

- If `weightSet` is assigned to a new [BlendShapeWeightsSet](../blendshapeweightsset.md), then the new set have the same number of weights and weight names as the current variable. Additionally, make sure the weight names exactly match the current set’s weight names.
- Weight name changes are ignored.
- Setting an incorrect number of weight values are ignored.
- Blend shape name changes are ignored.
