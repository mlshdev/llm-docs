# PointLightComponent.SurroundingsLight

**Framework:** RealityKit  
**Kind:** Structure  
**Availability:** macOS 27.0+ · visionOS 27.0+

A component that specifies that the point light illuminates the physical and immersive environment.

## Declaration

```swift
struct SurroundingsLight
```

<a id="Performance-Considerations"></a>

## Performance Considerations

Set [attenuationRadius](attenuationradius.md) deliberately on lights that use this component. Its default is often larger than needed, and the resulting on-screen footprint is the dominant driver of this effect’s cost.

The cost depends on how many pixels receive this effect, which is why attenuation radius is important. There is also a cost for each light that is in each pixel.

Excessive use of this effect may contribute to user-noticeable frame drops and can cause the device to heat up in graphically demanding situations. Monitor the thermal state and  usage as a mitigation, if necessary. Apps can monitor thermal state changes by subscribing to the [thermalStateDidChange](../../foundation/notificationcenter/messageidentifier/thermalstatedidchange.md) notification.

To stay responsive to the device’s available thermal headroom, read [thermalState](../../foundation/processinfo/thermalstate-swift.property.md) and observe [thermalStateDidChange](../../foundation/notificationcenter/messageidentifier/thermalstatedidchange.md) to react when it changes. As the reported state moves from `.fair` toward `.serious` and `.critical`, reduce the attenuation radius, or remove this component from lights where the effect is not essential.
