# ReverbComponent

**Framework:** RealityKit  
**Kind:** Structure  
**Availability:** iOS 18.0+ · iPadOS 18.0+ · Mac Catalyst 18.0+ · macOS 15.0+ · tvOS 26.0+ · visionOS 2.0+

A component that defines the reverberation of spatial audio sources.

## Declaration

```swift
struct ReverbComponent
```

## Overview

Bring your spatial audio to life by setting a reverb appropriate for your immersive environment. In visionOS, an acoustic simulation of a person’s real environment reverberates the spatial audio sources by default. When presenting your content in [progressive](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/immersionstyle/progressive) and [full](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/immersionstyle/full) immersive spaces, consider setting a reverb component to make your spatial audio sound like it exists within the environment that your visuals represent.

For example, a desert, living room, and concert hall each have unique acoustical characteristics. When the visuals and acoustic properties of sounds in your content are congruent, the environment becomes more effective as a whole.

```swift
// Create an entity to hold the reverb component and
// use the concert hall preset.
let reverbEntity = Entity()
reverbEntity.components.set(ReverbComponent(reverb: .preset(.concertHall)))

// Add the reverb entity to the reality view.
content.add(reverbEntity)

// Load an audio file of a violin.
if let violin = try? await AudioFileResource(named: "violin") {

    // Create an entity for playing the violin audio and
    // set the spatial audio component.
    let violinEntity = Entity()
    violinEntity.components.set(
        SpatialAudioComponent(
            directivity: .beam(focus: 0.2)
        )
    )
    violinEntity.playAudio(violin)

    // Add the violin entity to the reality view.
    content.add(violinEntity)
}
```

Use the [reverbLevel](spatialaudiocomponent/reverblevel.md) property to adjust the level of audio you send to the spatial modeler. Use the [directLevel](spatialaudiocomponent/directlevel.md) property to adjust the level of audio you send directly to a person’s ears, without additional reverberation. Use the [directivity](spatialaudiocomponent/directivity.md) property to define the pattern that disperses sound into the acoustic environment.

In macOS and iOS, only one `ReverbComponent` can be active at a time per [ARView](arview.md) or [RealityView](realityview.md). In visionOS, a `ReverbComponent` is only active while an app has a [progressive](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/immersionstyle/progressive) or [full](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/immersionstyle/full) immersive space open.

You can place multiple simulated reverb components in a scene — for example, one entity each for the ceiling, floor, and walls of a virtual room — and the reflections and reverb update as audio sources move through the space. However, only one preset reverb can be active at a time; if both a preset and simulated reverb are present, the preset takes priority.

When the content is within a [progressive](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/immersionstyle/progressive) immersive space, the Digital Crown adjusts how RealityKit blends:

- The acoustics simulation of a person’s real-world environment
- The reverberation the `ReverbComponent` generates

When your app is in a Shared Space [WindowGroup](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/windowgroup) or an [ImmersiveSpace](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/immersivespace) using a [mixed](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/immersionstyle/mixed) style, RealityKit reverberates the spatial audio from the acoustics simulation and ignores the reverberation from the `ReverbComponent`.
