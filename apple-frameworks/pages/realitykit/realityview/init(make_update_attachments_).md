# init(make:update:attachments:)

**Framework:** RealityKit  
**Kind:** Initializer  
**Availability:** visionOS 1.0+

Creates a reality view for visionOS, with attachments and an optional update closure.

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated init<A>(make: @escaping @MainActor @Sendable (inout RealityViewContent, RealityViewAttachments) async -> Void, update: (@MainActor (inout RealityViewContent, RealityViewAttachments) -> Void)? = nil, @AttachmentContentBuilder attachments: @escaping () -> A) where Content == RealityViewAttachmentBuilderContent<A, RealityViewContent.Body<RealityViewDefaultPlaceholder>>, A : AttachmentContent
```

## Parameters

- `make`: An asynchronous closure that configures the initial content of the new `RealityView`. This closure is asynchronous to keep your app’s UI responsive while you load content to populate this view.
- `update`: An optional closure that updates the `RealityView` instance’s content as the view’s state changes.
- `attachments`: An attachment content builder that adds attachment views to the content of the `RealityView`.

## Discussion

This initializer doesn’t automatically add the attachment views to your [RealityViewContent](../realityviewcontent.md). You can access the entities that represent the attachments by calling the [entity(for:)](../realityviewattachments/entity%28for_%29.md) method of the [RealityViewAttachments](../realityviewattachments.md), and add them to your content or as a child of another [Entity](../entity.md):

```swift
RealityView { content, attachments in
    if let attachment = attachments.entity(for: "example") {
        content.add(attachment)
    }
} attachments: {
    Attachment(id: "example") {
        Text("hello")
    }
}
```
