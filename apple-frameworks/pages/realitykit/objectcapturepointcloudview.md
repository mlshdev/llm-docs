# ObjectCapturePointCloudView

**Framework:** RealityKit  
**Kind:** Structure  
**Availability:** iOS 17.0+ · iPadOS 17.0+

Renders the current state of the point cloud from an object capture session.

## Declaration

```swift
@MainActor struct ObjectCapturePointCloudView
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

This view renders a 3D visualization of the current session’s point cloud. It includes a turntable gesture controller. This view allows the user to review the captured 3D model before finishing the capture and beginning object reconstruction.

## Topics

### Initializers

- [init(session:)](objectcapturepointcloudview/init%28session_%29.md): Creates an object capture view from an existing session using the current segment’s point cloud.

### Instance Methods

- [showShotLocations(\_:)](objectcapturepointcloudview/showshotlocations%28__%29.md): Shows the locations where shots have been taken. Example: ObjectCapturePointCloudView(session: mySession) .showShotLocations()
