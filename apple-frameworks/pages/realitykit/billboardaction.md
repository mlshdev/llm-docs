# BillboardAction

**Framework:** RealityKit  
**Kind:** Structure  
**Availability:** iOS 18.0+ · iPadOS 18.0+ · Mac Catalyst 18.0+ · macOS 15.0+ · tvOS 26.0+ · visionOS 2.0+

An action that animates the blend factor of an entity’s billboard component.

## Declaration

```swift
struct BillboardAction
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

This action animates the [blendFactor](billboardcomponent/blendfactor.md) value of an entity’s [BillboardComponent](billboardcomponent.md).

Over its duration, the action updates the `blendFactor` property to `1.0`. If you provide a [transitionIn](billboardaction/transitionin.md) configuration, the action interpolates the value of the component’s current value for [blendFactor](billboardcomponent/blendfactor.md) towards `1.0`. If you provide a [transitionOut](billboardaction/transitionout.md) configuration, the action interpolates the component’s [blendFactor](billboardcomponent/blendfactor.md) value from `1.0` to its original value for that component.

The example below creates a three-part animation that:

- Interpolates [blendFactor](billboardcomponent/blendfactor.md) from `0.0` to `1.0`
- Pauses for one second
- Interpolates [blendFactor](billboardcomponent/blendfactor.md) from `1.0` back to `0.0`

```swift
// Load a robot model from a resource file.
let robotModel = try await ModelEntity(named: "vintage_robot")

// A billboard component for the robot model entity.
var billboardComponent = BillboardComponent()

// Disable the billboard at the beginning by setting its blend factor to zero.
billboardComponent.blendFactor = 0.0

// Add the component to the entity.
await robotModel.components.set(billboardComponent)

// A transition that lasts one second.
let billboardTransition = BillboardAction.Transition(
    duration: 1.0,
    timingFunction: .easeInOut
)

// An action that starts and ends with a one second transition.
let billboardAction = BillboardAction(transitionIn: billboardTransition,
                                      transitionOut: billboardTransition)

// A three second animation that adjusts the blend factor twice.
//
// This animation includes a one second pause between both of the action's
// one second transitions in and out by setting the duration one second
// longer than action's total time.
let billboardAnimation = try AnimationResource
    .makeActionAnimation(for: billboardAction,
                         duration: 3.0,
                         bindTarget: .billboardBlendFactor)

// Play the three second billboard animation that adjusts the blend factor.
robotModel.playAnimation(billboardAnimation)
```

> **Note**

> If an entity doesn’t have a [BillboardComponent](billboardcomponent.md), the default initializer creates one for you so that it can restore the entity back to a state without the billboard.

> **Important**

> This action directly animates the [BindTarget.billboardBlendFactor](bindtarget/billboardblendfactor.md) on the bound entity. Ensure a correct bind target is supplied when creating the animation.

Ensure the action can transition back to a non-billboard state by adding the component to the entity and check the [blendFactor](billboardcomponent/blendfactor.md) property has a value that you expect.

## Topics

### Structures

- [BillboardAction.Transition](billboardaction/transition.md): The duration and timing of how an action event transitions from one state to another.

### Initializers

- [init(transitionIn:transitionOut:)](billboardaction/init%28transitionin_transitionout_%29.md): Creates a new billboard action.

### Instance Properties

- [animatedValueType](billboardaction/animatedvaluetype.md): The type for the value that the action modifies over time.
- [transitionIn](billboardaction/transitionin.md): The rate of change at the beginning of the action.
- [transitionOut](billboardaction/transitionout.md): The rate of change at the end of the action.
