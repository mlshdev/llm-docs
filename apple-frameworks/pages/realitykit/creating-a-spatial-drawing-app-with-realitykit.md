# Creating a spatial drawing app with RealityKit

**Framework:** RealityKit  
**Kind:** Sample Code  
**Availability:** visionOS 2.0+ · Xcode 16.0+

Use low-level mesh and texture APIs to achieve fast updates to a person’s brush strokes by integrating RealityKit with ARKit and SwiftUI.

### Configure the sample code project

To run this sample code, you’ll need:

- An Apple Vision Pro with visionOS 2 or later
- Xcode 16 or later

Because this sample app uses ARKit hand tracking on visionOS, drawing features aren’t available in the visionOS simulator.
