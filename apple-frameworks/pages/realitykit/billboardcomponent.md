# BillboardComponent

**Framework:** RealityKit  
**Kind:** Structure  
**Availability:** iOS 18.0+ · iPadOS 18.0+ · Mac Catalyst 18.0+ · macOS 15.0+ · tvOS 26.0+ · visionOS 2.0+

A component that orients an entity instance so that it continuously points toward the active camera.

## Declaration

```swift
struct BillboardComponent
```

## Mentioned In

- [Automatically animating RealityKit entities](automatically-animating-realitykit-entities.md)

## Overview

The `BillboardComponent` automatically adjusts an entity’s orientation so that its z-axis keeps pointing in the direction of the main camera in a RealityKit scene.

Add a `BillboardComponent` to any entity by passing it to an entity’s [set(\_:)](entity/componentset/set%28__%29-8sii2.md) method.

```swift
entity.components.set(BillboardComponent())
```

The entity immediately reorients itself so that it faces the scene’s active camera.

> **Important**

> An entity with `BillboardComponent` doesn’t provide access to its end orientation. Requesting the entity’s orientation through its transform returns only the unaltered orientation.
