# Physics joints and pins

**Framework:** RealityKit  
**Kind:** API Collection

Simulate joint physics that connect virtual objects.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

In a 3D environment, you can animate various attributes of an [Entity](entity.md) such as its location, rotation, and size from one value to another. This is ideal for simple pre-defined motion, but does not allow for interaction with external forces, such as collisions with other objects, or gestures. With a [PhysicsJoint](physicsjoint.md) you can connect entities with pins, and RealityKit keeps your entities bound by constraints that you define.

Each joint consists of two pins, each of which belongs to a different entity. Each [GeometricPin](geometricpin.md) moves and rotates relative to each other within the bounds of the joint’s constraints.

## Topics

### Pin and joint components

- [Simulating physics joints in your RealityKit app](simulating-physics-joints-in-your-realitykit-app.md): Create realistic, connected motion using physics joints.
- [GeometricPin](geometricpin.md): A structure that identifies a local transform relative to an entity or entity’s animating skeletal joint.
- [GeometricPinsComponent](geometricpinscomponent.md): A component that stores a sequence of geometric pins.
- [PhysicsJoint](physicsjoint.md): A type that describes physics joints.
- [PhysicsJointsComponent](physicsjointscomponent.md): A component that stores physics joints which RealityKit simulates.
- [EntityGeometricPins](entitygeometricpins.md): A structure that wraps all geometric pins an entity owns.
- [AttachedTransformComponent](attachedtransformcomponent.md): A component that stores an optional source pin owned by this entity and a target pin which this entity is attached to

### Built-in joint types

- [PhysicsRevoluteJoint](physicsrevolutejoint.md): A joint that allows one degree of rotational freedom between two entity pins, similar to a door swinging on its hinges.
- [PhysicsPrismaticJoint](physicsprismaticjoint.md): A joint that allows movement along a straight line, similar to a sliding drawer.
- [PhysicsSphericalJoint](physicssphericaljoint.md): A spherical joint that allows free rotational movement between two entities’ pins.
- [PhysicsCustomJoint](physicscustomjoint.md): A joint with six degrees of freedom that can be individually specified.
- [PhysicsDistanceJoint](physicsdistancejoint.md): A joint that maintains a minimum and maximum distance between two entity pins.
- [PhysicsFixedJoint](physicsfixedjoint.md): A joint that rigidly connects two entity pins, with zero degrees of freedom.
- [PhysicsJoints](physicsjoints.md): A collection of physics joints.
