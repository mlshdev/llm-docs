# canRequestImageCapture

**Framework:** RealityKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 17.0+ · iPadOS 17.0+

Will be `true` only when a call to [requestImageCapture()](requestimagecapture%28%29.md) is expected to be successful. It will be `false` when not in the `.capturing` state or if the session is too busy to currently process a new request. There is a period of time after requesting an image capture where this property will be `false` and a new call to [requestImageCapture()](requestimagecapture%28%29.md)  will not produce a new image.

## Declaration

```swift
@MainActor var canRequestImageCapture: Bool { get }
```
