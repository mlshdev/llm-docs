# ObjectCaptureSession.Feedback

**Framework:** RealityKit  
**Kind:** Enumeration  
**Availability:** iOS 17.0+ · iPadOS 17.0+

Provides information about possible problems with the capture session.

## Declaration

```swift
enum Feedback
```

## Topics

### Enumeration Cases

- [ObjectCaptureSession.Feedback.environmentLowLight](feedback-swift.enum/environmentlowlight.md): The lighting in the environment is low, which can degrade reconstruction quality. Auto-capture still proceeds but reconstruction quality may suffer. It is advised to increase lighting.
- [ObjectCaptureSession.Feedback.environmentTooDark](feedback-swift.enum/environmenttoodark.md): The lighting in the environment is too dark to proceed. Auto-capture will stop and the user will need to increase lighting levels to resolve this condition in order to continue capture.
- [ObjectCaptureSession.Feedback.movingTooFast](feedback-swift.enum/movingtoofast.md): The user is moving too quickly for clear images and the capturing may be paused to ensure quality.
- [ObjectCaptureSession.Feedback.objectNotDetected](feedback-swift.enum/objectnotdetected.md): If the detection of the object fails and a default manual box is presented instead, this element will be in the feedback to allow relevant information to be provided to the user for selecting a manual scanning volume and describing the operational envelope for the automatic object detection.
- [ObjectCaptureSession.Feedback.objectNotFlippable](feedback-swift.enum/objectnotflippable.md): It is not recommended to flip this object since is is unlikely the algorithm will be able to stitch the flipped orientation. This is usually due to feature-less, low-texture objects. In this case, multiple passes at different heights leaving object at its original orientation are recommended instead of flipping.
- [ObjectCaptureSession.Feedback.objectTooClose](feedback-swift.enum/objecttooclose.md): The camera is too close to the object and it cannot be tracked well.
- [ObjectCaptureSession.Feedback.objectTooFar](feedback-swift.enum/objecttoofar.md): The camera is too far from the object and it cannot be captured well.
- [ObjectCaptureSession.Feedback.outOfFieldOfView](feedback-swift.enum/outoffieldofview.md): The bounding box of the object is not in the field of view of the camera so auto-capture will not operate.
- [ObjectCaptureSession.Feedback.overCapturing](feedback-swift.enum/overcapturing.md): If the `numberOfShotsTaken > maximumNumberOfInputImages` then any additional shots will not be used in an on-device reconstruction and reconstruction is recommended to be done on a Mac that can support a greater number of images.
