# ObjectCaptureSession.CaptureState

**Framework:** RealityKit  
**Kind:** Enumeration  
**Availability:** iOS 17.0+ · iPadOS 17.0+

State of the capture session.

## Declaration

```swift
enum CaptureState
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

A session starts in `.initializing` state and proceeds through the other states via use of function calls until it reaches an end state.  A session is over when the capture state is set to `.completed` or `.failed(Error)`.

## Topics

### Operators

- [==(\_:\_:)](capturestate/==%28____%29.md): Two states are defined equal if they have the same case. Specifically, a `.failed(Error)` state will match any other failed state regardless of the actual error payload.

### Enumeration Cases

- [ObjectCaptureSession.CaptureState.capturing](capturestate/capturing.md): Auto-capture is in progress.
- [ObjectCaptureSession.CaptureState.completed](capturestate/completed.md): The session has saved its data and can now be safely torn down and the images folder used for reconstruction.
- [ObjectCaptureSession.CaptureState.detecting](capturestate/detecting.md): The object selection box is being detected / manipulated and is not yet complete. A call to `startCapturing()` in this state will move the session to `.capturing` to begin capturing the object indicated within the currently specified bounding box.
- [ObjectCaptureSession.CaptureState.failed(\_:)](capturestate/failed%28__%29.md): There was an unrecoverable error and the session is now invalid and needs to be torn down.
- [ObjectCaptureSession.CaptureState.finishing](capturestate/finishing.md): The session is saving outstanding data and finishing up.
- [ObjectCaptureSession.CaptureState.initializing](capturestate/initializing.md): The session and camera feed are initializing.
- [ObjectCaptureSession.CaptureState.ready](capturestate/ready.md): The session is ready to begin taking calls to capture.
