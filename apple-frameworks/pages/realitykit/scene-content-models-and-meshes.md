# Models and meshes

**Framework:** RealityKit  
**Kind:** API Collection

Display virtual objects in your scene with mesh-based models.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

Meshes are the building blocks for every visible geometric shape and model in RealityKit, including those that come from a USDZ file. Create primitive shapes by calling a [MeshResource](meshresource.md) factory method, such as [generateBox(size:cornerRadius:)](meshresource/generatebox%28size_cornerradius_%29-8em0v.md), or define your own mesh by creating and configuring a [MeshDescriptor](meshdescriptor.md) or a [LowLevelMesh](lowlevelmesh.md) instance.

Display meshes in your scene by creating a [ModelComponent](modelcomponent.md) for each mesh, and add that component to an entity. You can also add [Material](material.md) instances to your mesh by adding them to the same `ModelComponent` instance.
