# Anchors

**Framework:** RealityKit  
**Kind:** API Collection

Lock virtual content to the real world.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

RealityKit anchors all entities in a scene to an anchor target in the same scene, such as the ground, an image, or a position relative to its parent view. RealityKit provides several types you can use as the target for your anchors.

## Topics

### Anchoring components

- [AnchoringComponent](anchoringcomponent.md): A component that anchors virtual content to a real world target.
- [AnchoringComponent.Target](anchoringcomponent/target-swift.enum.md): Defines the kinds of real world objects to which an anchor entity can be tethered.
- [AnchoringComponent.TrackingMode](anchoringcomponent/trackingmode-swift.struct.md): Options for how an entity tracks its target anchor.
- [ARKitAnchorComponent](arkitanchorcomponent.md): A component that exposes the backing ARKit data of an anchored entity.
- [AnchorEntity](anchorentity.md): An anchor that tethers entities to a scene.
- [HasAnchoring](hasanchoring.md): An interface that enables anchoring of virtual content to a real-world object in an AR scene.

### Surface anchor characterization

- [AnchoringComponent.Target.Alignment](anchoringcomponent/target-swift.enum/alignment.md): Defines the alignment of real-world surfaces to seek as targets.
- [AnchoringComponent.Target.Classification](anchoringcomponent/target-swift.enum/classification.md): Defines types of real-world surfaces to seek as targets.

### Image and object tracking

- [AnchoringComponent.ImageAnchoringSource](anchoringcomponent/imageanchoringsource.md): Defines the source of image anchoring target based on how it is created.
- [AnchoringComponent.ObjectAnchoringSource](anchoringcomponent/objectanchoringsource.md): Defines the source of object anchoring target based on how it is created.

### Hand tracking

- [Happy Beam](../visionos/happybeam.md): Leverage a Full Space to create a fun game using ARKit.
- [AnchoringComponent.Target.HandLocation](anchoringcomponent/target-swift.enum/handlocation.md): Defines the locations of tracked hands to look for.
- [AnchoringComponent.Target.Chirality](anchoringcomponent/target-swift.enum/chirality.md): Defines the chirality of tracked hands to look for.

### Spatial tracking

- [SpatialTrackingSession](spatialtrackingsession.md): An object that incorporates spatial tracking capabilities into your RealityKit apps.
- [SpatialTrackingSession.Configuration](spatialtrackingsession/configuration.md): A type for configuring the spatial tracking session.
- [SpatialTrackingSession.Configuration.AnchorCapability](spatialtrackingsession/configuration/anchorcapability.md): A type that defines various anchor tracking capabilities.
- [SpatialTrackingSession.Configuration.SceneUnderstandingCapability](spatialtrackingsession/configuration/sceneunderstandingcapability.md): Defines how system behaviors use scene understanding.
- [SpatialTrackingSession.Configuration.Camera](spatialtrackingsession/configuration/camera.md): Defines the camera feed the RealityView renders.
- [SpatialTrackingSession.UnavailableCapabilities](spatialtrackingsession/unavailablecapabilities.md): A type that contains the unavailable capabilities of the current spatial tracking session.

### Body and face tracking

- [Creating an App for Face-Painting in AR](creating-an-app-for-face-painting-in-ar.md): Combine RealityKit’s face detection with PencilKit to implement virtual face-painting.
- [Occluding virtual content with people](../arkit/occluding-virtual-content-with-people.md): Cover your app’s virtual content with people that ARKit perceives in the camera feed.
- [Placing entities using head and device transform](../visionos/placing-entities-using-head-and-device-transform.md): Query and react to changes in the position and rotation of Apple Vision Pro.
- [BodyTrackingComponent](bodytrackingcomponent.md): A component for tracking people in an AR session.
- [BodyTrackedEntity](bodytrackedentity.md): An entity used to animate a virtual character in an AR scene by tracking a real person.
- [HasBodyTracking](hasbodytracking.md): An interface that enables the animation of a virtual character by tracking a real person in AR.

### Accessory tracking

- [Tracking a handheld accessory as a virtual sculpting tool](tracking-a-handheld-accessory-as-a-virtual-sculpting-tool.md): Use a tracked accessory with Apple Vision Pro to create a virtual sculpture.

### Physics simulation space

- [AnchoringComponent.PhysicsSimulation](anchoringcomponent/physicssimulation-swift.enum.md): Describes the physics simulation space of the entity and its descendants.
