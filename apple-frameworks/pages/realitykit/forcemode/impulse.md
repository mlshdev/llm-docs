## Discussion

The quantity that user sets via [setForce(\_:index:)](../forceeffectparameters/setforce%28__index_%29.md) has the units of mass \* distance / time. `impulse` mode causes a change in linear momentum.

The quantity that user sets via [setTorque(\_:index:)](../forceeffectparameters/settorque%28__index_%29.md) has the units of mass \* distance^2 / time. `impulse` mode causes a change in angular momentum.
