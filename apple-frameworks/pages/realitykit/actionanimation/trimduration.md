## Discussion

The framework calculates `AnimationAction/duration`, but you can set this property to override it. This property is `nil` by default, which indicates that the animation stops after one play that spans `AnimationAction/duration`.

If you set a non-zero value for this property and both `AnimationAction/trimStart` and `AnimationAction/trimEnd` are `nil`, the animation observes this property as an edited duration.

When you set `AnimationAction/repeatMode` to make the animation repeat:

- If this property is `nil`, the animation repeats forever.
- If set to a value greater than `AnimationAction/duration`, the animation repeats for the specified duration.
