# Docking a video player in an immersive scene

**Framework:** RealityKit  
**Kind:** Sample Code  
**Availability:** visionOS 2.0+ · Xcode 16.0+

Secure a video player in an immersive scene with a docking region you can specify.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

In visionOS, all full-screen videos automatically dock when an immersive space is open. This behavior places the video in a fixed position within your immersive space. You can use [DockingRegionComponent](dockingregioncomponent.md) to customize the width and location of the docking region.

This sample code project demonstrates how to use the RealityKit API for the docking-region component. You define and specify the boundary of the docking region and docking position using a docking-region component, and attach it to an entity within the immersive scene. Then you position the entity that has the docking-region component to customize the docking position.

The docking-region component allows developers to customize the docking region. Alternatively, you can add and define a docking-region component using Reality Composer Pro. See [Building an immersive experience with RealityKit](building-an-immersive-experience-with-realitykit.md) for more details.

The sample app presents an AV player view controller with default playback controls, and a scene picker for selecting immersive scenes. You can start video playback with the default controls, and enter an immersive scene with the immersive view picker.

You can dock a video player by following the steps below.

### Create an immersive visionOS app

In Xcode, choose File \> New \> Project, select visionOS and Immersive Environment App in the New Project dialog, and click Next.

![An Xcode screenshot of the New Project dialog with the visionOS and Immersive Environment App options selected.](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.RealityKit/docking-xcode.png)

Enter your product name and organization identifier, and choose between a progressive and full immersive space. You can change the immersive setting later.

To continue, include a video in the bundle or provide a URL to an external video in `AVPlayerViewModel.swift`. The Immersive Environment App template launches with a window that includes a single button to show the immersive space. Showing the immersive space starts playing the video and displays the `AVPlayerView` full screen in the window. The system automatically docks this full-screen video in the default docking position.

### Play the video in the shared space

To play the video in the shared space and immersive space, remove the calls to the `avPlayerViewModel` in the [onAppear(perform:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/onappear%28perform:%29) and [onDisappear(perform:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/ondisappear%28perform:%29) methods of `ImmersiveView`. Remove the `ToggleImmersiveSpaceButton` from the `ContentView` and replace it with a button that plays the video. At this point, the app plays the video full screen after someone taps the Play Video button, but the custom immersive space doesn’t appear.

### Add an immersive scene-viewing option to your video player

Create an immersive picker view that toggles the immersive scene through existing immersive space APIs.

```swift
struct ImmersivePickerView: View {
    let appModel: AppModel
    
    /// An asynchronous call returns after dismissing the immersive space.
    @Environment(\.dismissImmersiveSpace) private var dismissImmersiveSpace
    /// An asynchronous call returns after opening the immersive space.
    @Environment(\.openImmersiveSpace) private var openImmersiveSpace
    
    var body: some View {
        // Add a button to toggle the immersive environment.
        Button("Sky Dome", systemImage: "photo") {
            Task {
                if appModel.immersiveSpaceIsShown {
                    await dismissImmersiveSpace()
                } else {
                    await openImmersiveSpace(id: appModel.immersiveSpaceID)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Use [immersiveEnvironmentPicker(content:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/immersiveenvironmentpicker%28content:%29) to include this picker as an option in the list of immersive scene selections.

```
AVPlayerView(viewModel: avPlayerViewModel)
    .immersiveEnvironmentPicker {
        ImmersivePickerView(appModel: appModel)
    }
```

<a id="Create-a-docking-region-component-with-a-docking-entity"></a>

### Create a docking-region component with a docking entity

The Immersive Environment App template comes with a Reality Composer Pro project that includes a `Player` entity with the docking region. To customize the docking-region settings in Xcode, open the Reality Composer Pro package and remove the `Video_Dock` entity that contains the `Player` entity.

Within your `ImmersiveView`, create a docking-region component with a width of your choice. The docking region uses a cinematic `2.4:1` width-height ratio to determine the height.

```swift
// Create a docking-region component to customize your docking region.
var dockingRegionComponent = DockingRegionComponent()
// Set the docking region width to 9.6 meters.
dockingRegionComponent.width = 9.6
```

Create a docking entity and position the entity where you want to dock the AV player. Then attach the docking-region component to the docking entity.

```swift
// Create a docking entity as a docking anchor.
let dockingEntity = Entity()

// Set the position of your dock, in meters.
dockingEntity.position = [0, 2, -10]

// Attach the docking-region component to the docking entity.
dockingEntity.components.set(dockingRegionComponent)
```

And, finally, add it to your `RealityView`.

```swift
content.add(dockingEntity)
```
