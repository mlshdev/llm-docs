# OcclusionMaterial

**Framework:** RealityKit  
**Kind:** Structure  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 26.0+ · visionOS

An invisible material that hides objects rendered behind it.

## Declaration

```swift
struct OcclusionMaterial
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Add an `OcclusionMaterial` to a model by setting it as one of the [materials](modelcomponent/materials.md) in a [ModelComponent](modelcomponent.md).

```swift
let model = ModelComponent(
    mesh: .generateBox(size: 1),
    materials: [OcclusionMaterial()]
)
smallBoxEntity.components.set(model)
```

For example, on the left is a case of two cubes, the larger red cube is slightly further from the camera and has a simple material. The slightly smaller and closer cube has no material in the left image and an occlusion material on the right image.

The shape is of a cube with a cut-out in the shape of another cube slightly towards the upper right corner of the cube.](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.RealityKit/occlusionmaterial-applied.jpg) |

## Topics

### Creating an occlusion material

- [init(receivesDynamicLighting:)](occlusionmaterial/init%28receivesdynamiclighting_%29.md): Creates an occlusion material.
- [init()](occlusionmaterial/init%28%29.md)

### Receiving dynamic lighting

- [receivesDynamicLighting](occlusionmaterial/receivesdynamiclighting.md): A Boolean that indicates whether the occlusion material receives dynamic lighting.

### Setting depth testing properties

- [readsDepth](occlusionmaterial/readsdepth.md): A boolean value that determines whether this material performs the depth test by reading RealityKit’s depth buffer.

### Instance Properties

- [faceCulling](occlusionmaterial/faceculling-swift.property.md): A process in which the system specifies polygons to remove before rendering a mesh using this material.

### Type Aliases

- [OcclusionMaterial.FaceCulling](occlusionmaterial/faceculling-swift.typealias.md): An alias for the cull mode object that’s appropriate for this material class.
