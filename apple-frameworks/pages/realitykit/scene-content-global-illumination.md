# Global illumination and baked lighting

**Framework:** RealityKit  
**Kind:** API Collection

Light scenes realistically by precomputing illumination so surfaces pick up bounced color and ambient detail without recalculating it every frame.

## Overview

This collection gathers the tools for adding precomputed and environment-based lighting to your scenes. Use it to choose how surfaces respond to light, to bake static illumination and capture indirect light that nearby objects can sample, and to generate the surrounding imagery that lights a scene and fills its background. Reach for these features when you want richer, more believable lighting than real-time computation alone provides, while keeping rendering efficient. They suit scenes with mostly fixed lighting, where investing in precomputation pays off in visual quality and performance.

## Topics

### Lighting models

- [LightingModel](lightingmodel.md): The lighting model used by a [ShaderGraphMaterial.Program](shadergraphmaterial/program-swift.struct.md).
- [LitLightingModel](litlightingmodel.md): Configuration for RealityKit’s physically based lighting model.
- [UnlitLightingModel](unlitlightingmodel.md): Configuration for an unlit lighting model, which renders without any light interaction.
- [HairLightingModel](hairlightingmodel.md): Configuration for RealityKit’s hair lighting model.

### Lightmaps and light probes

- [LightmapResource](lightmapresource.md): A resource containing references to lightmap texture atlases and descriptions of how parts of the atlases map to meshes in the scene.
- [LightmapComponent](lightmapcomponent.md): Describes how a lightmap is applied to parts of the scene.
- [DiffuseProbeResource](diffuseproberesource.md): A resource containing baked diffuse lighting data organized as a tetrahedral probe mesh.
- [DiffuseLightProbeGroupComponent](diffuselightprobegroupcomponent.md): A component that stores diffuse probe data for a spatial region.
- [DiffuseLightProbeReceiverComponent](diffuselightprobereceivercomponent.md): A component that receives diffuse lighting from a referenced probe group.

### Environment texture generation

- [ImageBasedLightTextureGenerator](imagebasedlighttexturegenerator.md): An object that generates image-based-lighting diffuse and specular cube textures from a skybox.
- [SkyboxGenerator](skyboxgenerator.md): An object that generates a skybox cube texture from an equirectangular source.
- [TextureSamplingQuality](texturesamplingquality.md): A discrete trade-off between generation time and texture quality, used by [SkyboxGenerator](skyboxgenerator.md) and [ImageBasedLightTextureGenerator](imagebasedlighttexturegenerator.md).
