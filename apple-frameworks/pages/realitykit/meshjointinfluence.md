# MeshJointInfluence

**Framework:** RealityKit  
**Kind:** Structure  
**Availability:** iOS 18.0+ · iPadOS 18.0+ · Mac Catalyst 18.0+ · macOS 15.0+ · tvOS 26.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

A binding to a joint, which consists of the joint’s index and the weight of that joint’s influence on a vertex.

## Declaration

```swift
struct MeshJointInfluence
```

## Overview

A vertex may be influenced by one or more joints. The skinned position of that vertex is defined by a set of MeshJointInfluence values whose weights sum to 1. The skinned position is given by:

```swift
position = vertexPosition(transformedByJoint: influences[0].jointIndex) * influences[0].weight
         + vertexPosition(transformedByJoint: influences[1].jointIndex) * influences[1].weight
         + ...
```

The skinned position of a vertex is a linear combination of the vertex’s position transformed by each joint, with weights given by the MeshJointInfluence values.

To transform a vertex position by a joint, the initial vertex position is first transformed by the joint’s inverse bind pose matrix, then by the local-to-parent transform of the joint, and finally by the local-to-parent transform of each of the joint’s parents.

### Mesh skeletons

- [MeshResource.Skeleton](meshresource/skeleton.md): A skeleton consists of a hierarchy of joints. Each joint defines a coordinate space. Portions of a model may be thought of as having a position in a joint’s local space.
- [MeshResource.Skeleton.Joint](meshresource/skeleton/joint.md): A named joint in a [MeshResource.Skeleton](meshresource/skeleton.md).
- [MeshSkeletonCollection](meshskeletoncollection.md): An object that holds a collection of skeletons used by a mesh resource.
- [MeshResource.JointInfluences](meshresource/jointinfluences.md): A buffer of vertex-joint influences which bind the mesh part’s vertices to a skeleton via a skinning deformation.
