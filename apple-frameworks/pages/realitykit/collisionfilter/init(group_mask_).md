# init(group:mask:)

**Framework:** RealityKit  
**Kind:** Initializer  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 26.0+ · visionOS

Creates a collision filter.

## Declaration

```swift
init(group: CollisionGroup, mask: CollisionGroup)
```

## Parameters

- `group`: The collision group identifier.
- `mask`: The collision mask defines what objects will collide with objects using this filter.

## Discussion

Collision filters are created for the collision group specified in the `group` parameter. The `mask` parameter defines which objects will collide with the objects that use this filter. Because [CollisionGroup](../collisiongroup.md) conforms to [OptionSet](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/optionset), you can specify any combination of collision groups in the `mask` parameter by using the various [OptionSet](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/optionset) methods like `CollisionGroup/union(_:)`, `CollisionGroup/subtracting(_:)`, and `CollisionGroup/intersection(_:)`. Entities from any group contained in `mask` will collide with entities using this filter, while those not contained by `mask` will not.

To combine multiple groups into a filter, use the `CollisionGroup/union(_:)` method, like this:

```swift
let groupA = CollisionGroup(rawValue: 1 << 0)
let groupB = CollisionGroup(rawValue: 1 << 1)
let groupC = CollisionGroup(rawValue: 1 << 2)

// Create a filter that collides with A and C, but not B
let theFilter = CollisionFilter(group: groupA, mask: groupA.union(groupB))
```

A common use case is to want entities to collide with everything except one group, or a few groups. In a game, for example, you might not want a player’s pieces to collide with their own pieces, or you might not want players on the same team to collide with each other. You can accomplish that by starting with the [all](../collisiongroup/all.md) property, subtracting the group or groups that you don’t want the entities using this filter to collide with, like this:

```swift
// Create a filter that collides with everything except B
let notGroupB = CollisionGroup.all.subtracting(groupB)
```
