# scalingAbsorption(by:)

**Framework:** RealityKit  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 27.0+ · iPadOS 27.0+ · Mac Catalyst 27.0+ · macOS 27.0+ · tvOS 27.0+ · visionOS 27.0+

Scale the absorption data by a frequency-dependent scalar value between -1 and 1.

## Declaration

```swift
func scalingAbsorption(by frequencyDependentScalar: (Float) -> Float) -> Audio.Material
```

## Parameters

- `frequencyDependentScalar`: A function with frequency as input and coefficient scalar as output.

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

Audio material with absorption data scaled by the frequency-dependent scaling function.

## Discussion

- No adjustment is made to the coefficient when the scalar is 0.
- The coefficient is set to 0 when the scalar is -1.
- The coefficient is set to 1 when the scalar is +1.
- If the scalar value is between -1 and 0, the coefficient is adjusted by the percentage defined by the absolute value of the scalar between the original coefficient and 0.
- If the scalar value is between 0 and 1, the coefficient is adjusted by the percentage defined by the scalar between the original coefficient and 1.

Example usage:

```
// Make a generic carpet material more absorptive by making it thicker.
// Below 1000Hz, the absorption remains the same. Above 1000Hz, the absorption is increased.
let thickCarpet: Audio.Material = .carpet.scalingAbsorption { frequency in
    frequency > 1000 ? 0.5 : .zero
}
```
