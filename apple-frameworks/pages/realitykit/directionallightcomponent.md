# DirectionalLightComponent

**Framework:** RealityKit  
**Kind:** Structure  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 26.0+ · visionOS 2.0+

A component that defines a directional light source.

## Declaration

```swift
struct DirectionalLightComponent
```

## Overview

A directional light shines in the entity’s forward direction `[0, 0, -1]`.

Change the a directional light’s direction with the `Entity/orientation` or [look(at:from:upVector:relativeTo:)](hastransform/look%28at_from_upvector_relativeto_%29.md) method of the [Entity](entity.md) with a `DirectionalLightComponent`. The position of the entity does not play a part in the directional light’s effect.

> **Tip**

> Turn on shadows for a directional light by adding the [DirectionalLightComponent.Shadow](directionallightcomponent/shadow.md) component to an entity that has a `DirectionalLightComponent`.

Use this component with shadows by adding `DirectionalLightComponent` and [DirectionalLightComponent.Shadow](directionallightcomponent/shadow.md) to an entity’s [components](entity/components.md) set. In this example, the light’s color is red, and the intensity is `10_000`, which is an approximate lux for ambient daylight:

```swift
let lightEntity = Entity()

let redLightComponent = DirectionalLightComponent(
    color: .red, intensity: 10_000
)
let lightShadowComponent = DirectionalLightComponent.Shadow()
lightEntity.components.set([redLightComponent, lightShadowComponent])
```

The directional light illuminates entities evenly in the direction it derives from the orientation of `lightEntity`. Here is a visual example of how the above code snippet could illuminates entities in a scene:

| Without a directional light | With a directional light |
| --- | --- |
| ![A screenshot of a RealityKit scene with a dark gray floor, a light gray cube. There is no obvious lighting in the scene, so the edges of the cube are not clear.](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.RealityKit/directionallight-cube-off.jpg) | ![A screenshot of a RealityKit scene with a dark gray floor, a light gray cube, and five small green arrows in a row above the cube. There is a red light uniformly affecting the scene from above, casting a shadow to the right of the cube.](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.RealityKit/directionallight-cube-on.jpg) |

> The green arrows in the above illustration are only a visual representation of the light’s direction.

## Dynamic light capacity

On older hardware, only a limited number of dynamic lights can affect each object. Devices that support `MTLGPUFamily.apple6` or later lift this limit.

Excessive use of dynamic lights may contribute to user-noticeable frame drops and can cause the device to heat up in graphically demanding situations. Monitor the thermal state and reduce the number of lights as a mitigation, if necessary.

Because this behavior varies by device, verify your scene’s lighting on the oldest hardware you support. You can check for this support at runtime with `MTLDevice.supportsFamily(.apple6)`.

- [init(color:intensity:isRealWorldProxy:)](directionallightcomponent/init%28color_intensity_isrealworldproxy_%29-42x82.md): Creates a directional light with a configuration.
- [init(color:intensity:isRealWorldProxy:)](directionallightcomponent/init%28color_intensity_isrealworldproxy_%29-42x82.md): Creates a directional light with a configuration.

### Setting the color

- [color](directionallightcomponent/color-5ebuh.md): A color for the directional light.
- [color](directionallightcomponent/color-5ebuh.md): A color for the directional light.

### Setting intensity and shadows

- [intensity](directionallightcomponent/intensity.md): The intensity of the directional light, measured in lumen per square meter.
- [isRealWorldProxy](directionallightcomponent/isrealworldproxy.md): A Boolean that you use to control whether the directional light operates as a proxy for a real-world light.

### Supporting types

- [DirectionalLightComponent.Color](directionallightcomponent/color-swift.typealias.md): A platform-specific type used to define color for a directional light.

### Assigning render layers

- [layers](directionallightcomponent/layers.md): The layers this light illuminates.

### Structures

- [DirectionalLightComponent.Shadow](directionallightcomponent/shadow.md): A directional light component that adds shadows to entities that it illuminates

### Initializers

- [init(color:intensity:isRealWorldProxy:)](directionallightcomponent/init%28color_intensity_isrealworldproxy_%29.md): Creates a directional light with a configuration.
