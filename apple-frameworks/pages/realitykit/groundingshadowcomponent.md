# GroundingShadowComponent

**Framework:** RealityKit  
**Kind:** Structure  
**Availability:** iOS 18.0+ · iPadOS 18.0+ · Mac Catalyst 18.0+ · macOS 15.0+ · tvOS 26.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

A component that controls an entity’s grounding shadow.

## Declaration

```swift
struct GroundingShadowComponent
```

## Overview

A grounding shadow is an effect that makes an entity look like it has a light source directly above it. You can add a grounding shadow to any entity that has a [ModelComponent](modelcomponent.md) in its component set by adding a grounding shadow component to the entity’s [components](entity/components.md) property.

```swift
if let model = try? await ModelEntity(named: "tv_retro") {
    let shadowComponent = GroundingShadowComponent(castsShadow: true)
    model.components.set(shadowComponent)
}
```

You need to add the grounding shadow component to each entity you want to apply the effect to, because the grounding shadow component doesn’t apply to hierarchies.

> **Note**

> Neither virtual nor physical light sources affect grounding shadows.

### Receiving Shadows

By default, all entity models with a grounding shadow component can cast a shadow onto any other model entities in the scene. However, you can configure an entity to opt out of receiving shadows from other entities by setting a grounding shadow component’s [receivesShadow](groundingshadowcomponent/receivesshadow.md) property to `false` and adding that component to the entity that’s opting out.

```swift
let tvShadow = GroundingShadowComponent(castsShadow: true)
tvShadow.receivesShadow = false
tv.components.set(tvShadow)
```

Alternatively, you can create a new grounding shadow component instance that opts out of receiving shadows by passing `false` to the `receivesShadow` parameter of the [init(castsShadow:receivesShadow:)](groundingshadowcomponent/init%28castsshadow_receivesshadow_%29.md) initializer.

```swift
let robotShadow = GroundingShadowComponent(castsShadow: true,
                                           receivesShadow: false)
robot.components.set(robotShadow)
```

RealityKit generates grounding shadows from the perspective of another entity that receives the first entity’s shadow. One-sided geometry only casts a shadow if its facets face the entity that receives the shadow, which typically means they face downward. Make each 2D object cast a grounding shadow by applying a material that disables face culling, or by replacing it with a watertight mesh.

## Topics

### Initializers

- [init(castsShadow:)](groundingshadowcomponent/init%28castsshadow_%29.md): Creates a grounding shadow component.
- [init(castsShadow:receivesShadow:)](groundingshadowcomponent/init%28castsshadow_receivesshadow_%29.md): Creates a grounding shadow component by configuring whether its entity receives shadows from other model entities with the component.
- [init(castsShadow:receivesShadow:fadeBehaviorNearPhysicalObjects:)](groundingshadowcomponent/init%28castsshadow_receivesshadow_fadebehaviornearphysicalobjects_%29.md): Creates a grounding shadow component by configuring whether its entity receives shadows and its fade behavior near physical objects.

### Instance Properties

- [castsShadow](groundingshadowcomponent/castsshadow.md): A Boolean value that indicates whether an entity casts a shadow onto other model entities in the scene.
- [fadeBehaviorNearPhysicalObjects](groundingshadowcomponent/fadebehaviornearphysicalobjects-swift.property.md): Configures the grounding shadow’s fade behavior when the entity is near physical objects.
- [receivesShadow](groundingshadowcomponent/receivesshadow.md): A Boolean value that indicates whether an entity with the grounding shadow component receives grounding shadows from other model entities.

### Enumerations

- [GroundingShadowComponent.FadeBehaviorNearPhysicalObjects](groundingshadowcomponent/fadebehaviornearphysicalobjects-swift.enum.md): Describes the behavior of an entity’s grounding shadow when it’s near physical objects.

## Relationships

### Conforms To

- [Component](component.md)

### General shadows

- [DynamicLightShadowComponent](dynamiclightshadowcomponent.md): A component that controls an entity’s shadow from dynamic (virtual) lights.
