# Scenes

**Framework:** RealityKit  
**Kind:** API Collection

The context that holds all RealityKit entities.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

The system adds an [Entity](entity.md) to a [Scene](scene.md) when you add it to a [RealityView](realityview.md) with a [RealityViewCameraContent](realityviewcameracontent.md) or [RealityViewContent](realityviewcontent.md) instance. These scenes contain anchors and a hierarchy of entities that make up your RealityKit content.

The [Scene](scene.md) instance has helpful methods to perform ray casts to help you better understand your scene, and methods that find entities either by name or by components they own.

## Topics

### Scene management

- [Scene](scene.md): A container that holds the collection of entities that an AR view renders.
- [Scene.AnchorCollection](scene/anchorcollection.md): A collection of anchor entities.

### Entity searches

- [QueryPredicate](querypredicate.md): An object that defines the criteria for an entity query.
- [PixelCastHit](pixelcasthit.md)

### Event publishers and subscription

- [SceneEvents](sceneevents.md): Events the scene invokes.
- [Scene.Publisher](scene/publisher.md): A publisher for the given event type in the scene.

### Scene reconstructions and analysis

- [Creating a game with scene understanding](creating-a-game-with-scene-understanding.md): Create AR games and experiences that interact with real-world objects on LiDAR-equipped iOS devices.
- [Implementing scene understanding and reconstruction in your RealityKit app](realitykit-scene-understanding.md): Detect real-world objects and surfaces to create precise AR interactions.
- [Visualizing and interacting with a reconstructed scene](../arkit/visualizing-and-interacting-with-a-reconstructed-scene.md): Estimate the shape of the physical environment using a polygonal mesh.
- [sceneReconstruction](../arkit/arworldtrackingconfiguration/scenereconstruction.md): A flag that enables scene reconstruction.
- [supportsSceneReconstruction(\_:)](../arkit/arworldtrackingconfiguration/supportsscenereconstruction%28__%29.md): Checks if the device supports scene reconstruction.
- [SceneUnderstandingComponent](sceneunderstandingcomponent.md): A component that specifies an entity is participating in the system’s scene-understanding features.
- [ARView.Environment.SceneUnderstanding](arview/environment-swift.struct/sceneunderstanding-swift.struct.md): An object that holds scene-understanding options for the view.
- [ARView.Environment.SceneUnderstanding.Options](arview/environment-swift.struct/sceneunderstanding-swift.struct/options-swift.struct.md): Available scene-understanding options.
- [HasSceneUnderstanding](hassceneunderstanding.md): A specification that detects and reacts to features of the physical environment.
- [SceneReconstructionProvider](../arkit/scenereconstructionprovider.md): A source of live data about the shape of a person’s surroundings.
- [ARSession](../arkit/arsession.md): Deprecated. The object that manages the major tasks associated with every AR experience, such as motion tracking, camera passthrough, and image analysis.
