# CollisionFilter

**Framework:** RealityKit  
**Kind:** Structure  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 26.0+ · visionOS

A set of masks that determine whether entities can collide during simulations.

## Declaration

```swift
struct CollisionFilter
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Use Collision filters in combination with collision groups to define which entities collide with which other entities in a scene. For more information on using collision filters, see [CollisionGroup](collisiongroup.md)

## Topics

### Creating a collision filter

- [init(group:mask:)](collisionfilter/init%28group_mask_%29.md): Creates a collision filter.
- [default](collisionfilter/default.md): The default collision filter.
- [sensor](collisionfilter/sensor.md): A collision filter for an entity that collides with everything.

### Customizing groups

- [group](collisionfilter/group.md): The collision group or groups, stored as a bit mask, to which the entity belongs.
- [mask](collisionfilter/mask.md): The collision group or groups, stored as a bitmask, with which the entity can collide.
