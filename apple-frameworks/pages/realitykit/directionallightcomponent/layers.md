## Discussion

A directional light illuminates an entity when the layers of the entity’s [RenderLayerComponent](../renderlayercomponent.md) intersect with this set. Entities without a [RenderLayerComponent](../renderlayercomponent.md) belong to [defaultLayer](../renderlayer/defaultlayer.md), which is the only member of `layers` by default.

Define your custom layers in an extension to [RenderLayer](../renderlayer.md) and assign them to lights and entities to control which lights affect which entities:

```swift
extension RenderLayer {
    static let hero = RenderLayer("com.myapp.hero")
}

var light = DirectionalLightComponent(color: .white, intensity: 10_000)
light.layers = [.hero]
```

Lights can be restricted by layer on devices with Apple6 GPU family feature support.
