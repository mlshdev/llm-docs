## Discussion

When RealityKit begins syncing with a connected device, it sends that device a special message, called a *handshake packet*, over the network and waits for a response. Once it receives the correct response, it begins syncing the local RealityKit scene with the other connected app.

By default, RealityKit sends at most two handshake packets to a peer and waits up to 25,000 ms (25 seconds) for the peer to respond before giving up and disconnecting. Call this method to change the timeout or the number of handshake packets to send.
