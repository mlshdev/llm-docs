```

## Overview

Use `LowLevelMesh` when you want to bring your own vertex format to RealityKit or update your data frequently. To update your data in `LowLevelMesh`, you can either use Swift for CPU processing, or Metal Compute Shaders for GPU processing.

> **Note**

> Use [MeshDescriptor](meshdescriptor.md) for a simpler alternative to `LowLevelMesh`. For information on loading a model from a USD or Reality file, see [Loading entities from a file](loading-entities-from-a-file.md).

Express your vertex by creating a [LowLevelMesh.Descriptor](lowlevelmesh/descriptor-swift.struct.md) that describes your layout, along with the required index and vertex capacities. This descriptor is similar to [MTLVertexDescriptor](../metal/mtlvertexdescriptor.md), with additional semantics that make the data available in your shaders.

To use `LowLevelMesh`, first define your own vertex structure, either in a Metal header or using a Swift structure:

```swift
struct MyVertex {
    var position: SIMD3<Float> = .zero
    var color: UInt32 = .zero
}
```

Next, describe your structure to `LowLevelMesh` by creating a list of vertex attributes and a vertex layout. This description informs `LowLevelMesh` how to represent the vertex data in memory:

```swift
extension MyVertex {
    static var vertexAttributes: [LowLevelMesh.Attribute] = [
        .init(semantic: .position, format: .float3, offset: MemoryLayout<Self>.offset(of: \.position)!),
        .init(semantic: .color, format: .uchar4Normalized_bgra, offset: MemoryLayout<Self>.offset(of: \.color)!)
    ]

    static var vertexLayouts: [LowLevelMesh.Layout] = [
        .init(bufferIndex: 0, bufferStride: MemoryLayout<Self>.stride)
    ]

    static var descriptor: LowLevelMesh.Descriptor {
        var desc = LowLevelMesh.Descriptor()
        desc.vertexAttributes = MyVertex.vertexAttributes
        desc.vertexLayouts = MyVertex.vertexLayouts
        desc.indexType = .uint32
        return desc
    }
}
```

Create a [LowLevelMesh.Descriptor](lowlevelmesh/descriptor-swift.struct.md) and `LowLevelMesh`, and assign your mesh data and parts:

```swift
func triangleMesh() throws -> LowLevelMesh {
    var desc = MyVertex.descriptor
    desc.vertexCapacity = 3
    desc.indexCapacity = 3

    let mesh = try LowLevelMesh(descriptor: desc)

    mesh.withUnsafeMutableBytes(bufferIndex: 0) { rawBytes in
        let vertices = rawBytes.bindMemory(to: MyVertex.self)
        vertices[0] = MyVertex(position: [-1, -1, 0], color: 0xFF00FF00)
        vertices[1] = MyVertex(position: [ 1, -1, 0], color: 0xFFFF0000)
        vertices[2] = MyVertex(position: [ 0,  1, 0], color: 0xFF0000FF)
    }

    mesh.withUnsafeMutableIndices { rawIndices in
        let indices = rawIndices.bindMemory(to: UInt32.self)
        indices[0] = 0
        indices[1] = 1
        indices[2] = 2
    }

    let meshBounds = BoundingBox(min: [-1, -1, 0], max: [1, 1, 0])
    mesh.parts.replaceAll([
        LowLevelMesh.Part(
            indexCount: 3,
            topology: .triangle,
            bounds: meshBounds
        )
    ])

    return mesh
}
```

To finish, create a [MeshResource](meshresource.md) from the `LowLevelMesh`, and add it to a [ModelComponent](modelcomponent.md). You can then add this model to any [Entity](entity.md) in your scene:

```swift
func triangleEntity() throws -> Entity {
    let lowLevelMesh = try triangleMesh()
    let resource = try MeshResource(from: lowLevelMesh)

    let modelComponent = ModelComponent(mesh: resource, materials: [UnlitMaterial()])

    let entity = Entity()
    entity.name = "Triangle"
    entity.components.set(modelComponent)
    entity.scale *= 0.1
    return entity
}
```

The low-level mesh creates a triangular shape in your RealityKit scene:

![A screenshot of an isosceles triangle, floating in a kitchen scene. The triangle appears light gray in color.](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.RealityKit/lowlevelmesh-triangle-unlit.jpg)

The [MeshResource](meshresource.md) retains a reference to the `LowLevelMesh`, reflecting any changes when the renderer updates.
