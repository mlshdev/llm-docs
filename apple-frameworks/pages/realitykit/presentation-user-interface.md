## Overview

RealityKit provides controls that enable interactions specific to each platform and context. For example, you can allow someone to interact with an entity that already has a [CollisionComponent](collisioncomponent.md) by adding the [InputTargetComponent](inputtargetcomponent.md) component. A RealityKit entity can visibly change when someone looks directly at it with a [HoverEffectComponent](hovereffectcomponent.md) component. Additionally, you can manage an entity’s accessibility information with [AccessibilityComponent](accessibilitycomponent.md).

## Topics

### Direct and indirect gestures

- [Transforming RealityKit entities using gestures](transforming-realitykit-entities-with-gestures.md): Build a RealityKit component to support standard visionOS gestures on any entity.
- [InputTargetComponent](inputtargetcomponent.md): A component that gives an entity the ability to receive system input.
- [ManipulationComponent](manipulationcomponent.md): A component that adds fluid and immersive interactive behaviors and effects.
- [GestureComponent](gesturecomponent.md): A component attaching a UI gesture to an entity.
- [EntityTargetValue](entitytargetvalue.md): A value containing an original gesture value along with a targeted entity.

### Accessibility

- [Improving the Accessibility of RealityKit Apps](improving-the-accessibility-of-realitykit-apps.md): Incorporate assistive technologies in your augmented reality app.
- [AccessibilityComponent](accessibilitycomponent.md): A component that stores accessibility information for an entity.
- [AccessibilityComponent.SupportedActions](accessibilitycomponent/supportedactions.md): A custom action that can be invoked on an entity in response to specific user cues.
- [AccessibilityComponent.CustomContent](accessibilitycomponent/customcontent-swift.struct.md): A CustomContent struct contains the accessibility strings for the labels you apply to your accessibility content.
- [AccessibilityComponent.RotorType](accessibilitycomponent/rotortype.md): A context-sensitive event that helps VoiceOver users find the next instance of a related element.
- [AccessibilityEvents](accessibilityevents.md)

### Visual adjustments

- [HoverEffectComponent](hovereffectcomponent.md): A component that applies a visual effect to a hierarchy of entities when a person looks at or selects an entity.
- [BillboardComponent](billboardcomponent.md): A component that orients an entity instance so that it continuously points toward the active camera.
- [EnvironmentBlendingComponent](environmentblendingcomponent.md): A component that controls how an entity blends visually with objects in the local environment.
- [LensDistortionData](lensdistortiondata.md): A description of estimated lens distortion that can be used to rectify images.
- [ImagePresentationComponent](imagepresentationcomponent.md): A component that supports general image presentation.

### UIKit and AppKit gestures

- [ARView.EntityGestures](arview/entitygestures.md): The set of possible entity gesture recognizers.
- [EntityRotationGestureRecognizer](entityrotationgesturerecognizer.md): A gesture recognizer that uses rotation gestures involving two touches to rotate a given entity.
- [EntityScaleGestureRecognizer](entityscalegesturerecognizer.md): A gesture recognizer that uses a pinch gesture to scale or zoom an entity.
- [EntityTranslationGestureRecognizer](entitytranslationgesturerecognizer.md): A gesture recognizer that uses a pan gesture to move an entity.
- [EntityGestureRecognizer](entitygesturerecognizer.md): A gesture recognizer that works on entities.
