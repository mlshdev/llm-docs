# LowLevelBuffer

**Framework:** RealityKit  
**Kind:** Class  
**Availability:** iOS 26.0+ · iPadOS 26.0+ · Mac Catalyst 26.0+ · macOS 26.0+ · tvOS 26.0+ · visionOS 26.0+

## Declaration

```swift
final class LowLevelBuffer
```

## Topics

### Structures

- [LowLevelBuffer.Descriptor](lowlevelbuffer/descriptor-swift.struct.md)

### Initializers

- [init(descriptor:)](lowlevelbuffer/init%28descriptor_%29.md)

### Instance Properties

- [bytesUsed](lowlevelbuffer/bytesused.md)
- [descriptor](lowlevelbuffer/descriptor-swift.property.md)

### Instance Methods

- [read(using:)](lowlevelbuffer/read%28using_%29.md): Retrieve the current contents of the buffer, for GPU reading.
- [replace(using:)](lowlevelbuffer/replace%28using_%29.md): Retrieve an MTLBuffer that can be used to replace the contents of the buffer on GPU using Metal.
- [replaceUnsafeMutableBytes(\_:)](lowlevelbuffer/replaceunsafemutablebytes%28__%29.md): Replace the buffer’s contents synchronously on the CPU.
- [withUnsafeBytes(\_:)](lowlevelbuffer/withunsafebytes%28__%29.md): Read the buffer synchronously on the CPU. The buffer provided is only valid for the lifetime of the callback.
- [withUnsafeMutableBytes(\_:)](lowlevelbuffer/withunsafemutablebytes%28__%29.md): Update the buffer’s contents synchronously on the CPU. The buffer provided is only valid for the lifetime of the callback.
