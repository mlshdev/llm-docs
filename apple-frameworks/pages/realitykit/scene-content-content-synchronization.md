# Content synchronization

**Framework:** RealityKit  
**Kind:** API Collection

Synchronize the contents of entities locally or across the network.

## Topics

### Entity ownership synchronization

- [SynchronizationService](synchronizationservice.md): An interface that enables entity synchronization among a group of local peers.
- [SynchronizationService.Identifier](synchronizationservice/identifier.md): A type that represents a synchronization service identifier.
- [SynchronizationPeerID](synchronizationpeerid.md): A type that represents a peer among a group of networked devices.
- [SynchronizationComponent](synchronizationcomponent.md): A component that synchronizes an entity between processes and networked applications.
- [SynchronizationComponent.OwnershipTransferMode](synchronizationcomponent/ownershiptransfermode-swift.enum.md): Modes of ownership transfer.
- [SynchronizationComponent.OwnershipTransferCompletionResult](synchronizationcomponent/ownershiptransfercompletionresult.md): The result of an ownership transfer request.
- [SynchronizationEvents](synchronizationevents.md): Events associated with network synchronization of scene information.
- [HasSynchronization](hassynchronization.md): An interface that enables an entity to be synchronized between processes and networked applications.

### Multipeer synchronization

- [Loading remote assets in multiplayer apps](loading-remote-assets.md): Ensure assets load on all connected peers before using them.
- [MultipeerConnectivityService](multipeerconnectivityservice.md): A service that provides scene synchronization among all peers in a multipeer connectivity session.
- [NetworkCompatibilityToken](networkcompatibilitytoken.md): An opaque token used to check the networking compatibility between two peers in a multipeer connection.
- [NetworkCompatibilityToken.Compatibility](networkcompatibilitytoken/compatibility.md): Indicates whether two devices running RealityKit are compatible and able to connect and sync scenes.
- [TransientComponent](transientcomponent.md): An interface for components that aren’t saved to file or cloned.
