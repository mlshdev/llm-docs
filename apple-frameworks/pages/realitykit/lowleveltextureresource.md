# LowLevelTextureResource

**Framework:** RealityKit  
**Kind:** Class  
**Availability:** iOS 27.0+ · iPadOS 27.0+ · tvOS 27.0+ · visionOS 27.0+

A container for texture data in a custom format.

## Declaration

```swift
final class LowLevelTextureResource
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Use `LowLevelTextureResource` when you want to bring your own texture data to the renderer or update your data frequently. Textures are updated on the GPU by writing to a `MTLTexture` returned by `replace(commandBuffer:)`. The descriptor is analogous to `MTLTextureDescriptor`.

Create a `LowLevelTextureResource` using [makeTextureResource(descriptor:)](lowlevelrendercontext/maketextureresource%28descriptor_%29.md).

## Topics

### Accessing the descriptor

- [descriptor](lowleveltextureresource/descriptor-swift.property.md): The descriptor used to create this texture resource.
- [LowLevelTextureResource.Descriptor](lowleveltextureresource/descriptor-swift.struct.md): The configuration for a new low-level texture resource.

### Reading and writing texture data

- [read(commandBuffer:)](lowleveltextureresource/read%28commandbuffer_%29.md): Returns a Metal texture containing the current contents of the texture resource for GPU read operations.
- [replace(commandBuffer:)](lowleveltextureresource/replace%28commandbuffer_%29.md): Returns a Metal texture you populate on the GPU with the new contents of the texture resource.

### GPU resources

- [LowLevelMeshResource](lowlevelmeshresource.md): A container for vertex and index data in a custom format.
- [LowLevelMeshPart](lowlevelmeshpart.md): An object that describes a range of primitives to draw from a mesh resource.
- [LowLevelMeshInstance](lowlevelmeshinstance.md): A single drawable object pairing a mesh part with a compiled pipeline state, optional per-draw argument tables, a transform, and a sort category.
- [LowLevelMeshInstanceArray](lowlevelmeshinstancearray.md): A fixed-capacity collection of mesh instances submitted to the renderer.
- [LowLevelInstanceTransformResource](lowlevelinstancetransformresource.md): A GPU-managed buffer that stores an array of per-instance transforms for GPU instancing.
- [LowLevelBufferResource](lowlevelbufferresource.md): A GPU-managed buffer for arbitrary per-draw data such as uniforms and custom parameters.
- [LowLevelBufferSlice](lowlevelbufferslice.md): A reference to a sub-range of a buffer resource, used to bind a region of a buffer to an argument table slot.
- [LowLevelMaterialResource](lowlevelmaterialresource.md): A compiled material composed of three independently-replaceable shader functions.
- [LowLevelDeviceResource](lowleveldeviceresource.md): Encapsulates a GPU device resource created by the application. On visionOS, resources must be allocated in shared memory that can be used by the renderer process. Once a device resource is in use by the renderer, changing its contents is unsafe and undefined.
- [BoundingSphereBox](boundingspherebox.md): A combined bounding volume consisting of a bounding sphere and an optional axis-aligned bounding box.
