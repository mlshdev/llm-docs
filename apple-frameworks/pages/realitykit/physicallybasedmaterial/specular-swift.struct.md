# PhysicallyBasedMaterial.Specular

**Framework:** RealityKit  
**Kind:** Structure  
**Availability:** iOS 15.0+ · iPadOS 15.0+ · Mac Catalyst 15.0+ · macOS 12.0+ · tvOS 26.0+ · visionOS

An object that defines the specular highlights of an entity.

## Declaration

```swift
struct Specular
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

RealityKit automatically draws *specular highlights* for physically based materials, using the values of various properties, primarily [roughness](roughness-swift.property.md) and [metallic](metallic-swift.property.md). Specular highlights are bright spots of reflected light that appear on shiny objects.

Although many real-world objects can be accurately and realistically simulated with just the core physically based rendering (PBR) properties, you can create additional realistic effects by augmenting the specular highlights.

Use this object to specify the amount of [specular](specular-swift.property.md) for a [PhysicallyBasedMaterial](../physicallybasedmaterial.md).

## Topics

### Creating a specular object

- [init(floatLiteral:)](specular-swift.struct/init%28floatliteral_%29.md): Creates an object from single value.
- [init(scale:texture:)](specular-swift.struct/init%28scale_texture_%29.md): Creates an object from a single value or a texture.
- [init(\_:)](specular-swift.struct/init%28__%29.md): Creates an object from a custom material’s specular property.

### Accessing specular values

- [texture](specular-swift.struct/texture.md): The amount of specular as a UV-mapped image texture.
- [textureSemantic](specular-swift.struct/texturesemantic.md): The intended use of the object’s texture property.
- [scale](specular-swift.struct/scale.md): The amount of specular for the entire entity.
