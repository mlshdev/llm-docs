# PhysicallyBasedMaterial.EmissiveColor

**Framework:** RealityKit  
**Kind:** Structure  
**Availability:** iOS 15.0+ · iPadOS 15.0+ · Mac Catalyst 15.0+ · macOS 12.0+ · tvOS 26.0+ · visionOS

An object that defines the color of the light an entity emits.

## Declaration

```swift
struct EmissiveColor
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

With physically based rendering (PBR), you can give entities in RealityKit the appearance of emitting light. Define the color of the light the entity emits by using this object.

## Topics

### Creating an emissive color object

- [init(color:texture:)](emissivecolor-swift.struct/init%28color_texture_%29-3dtam.md): Creates a color of emitted light in iOS.
- [init(color:texture:)](emissivecolor-swift.struct/init%28color_texture_%29-5hl9i.md): Creates a color of emitted light in iOS.
- [init(\_:)](emissivecolor-swift.struct/init%28__%29.md): Creates a color of emitted light from a custom material’s emissive color property.

### Accessing texture data

- [texture](emissivecolor-swift.struct/texture.md): An optional image texture that defines the color of light emission.
- [textureSemantic](emissivecolor-swift.struct/texturesemantic.md): The intended use of the object’s texture property.

### Initializers

- [init(color:texture:)](emissivecolor-swift.struct/init%28color_texture_%29.md): Creates a color of emitted light in iOS.

### Instance Properties
