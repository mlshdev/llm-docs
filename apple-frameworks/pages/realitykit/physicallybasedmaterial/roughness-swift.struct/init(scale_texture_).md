# init(scale:texture:)

**Framework:** RealityKit  
**Kind:** Initializer  
**Availability:** iOS 15.0+ · iPadOS 15.0+ · Mac Catalyst 15.0+ · macOS 12.0+ · tvOS 26.0+ · visionOS

Creates a roughness object from a color or texture.

## Declaration

```swift
init(scale: Float = 1.0, texture: PhysicallyBasedMaterial.Texture? = nil)
```

## Parameters

- `scale`: The roughness value.
- `texture`: An optional image texture.

## Discussion

The `roughness` property represents how much the surface of the entity scatters light it reflects. A material with a high roughness has a matte appearance, while one with a low roughness has a shiny appearance.

Use this initializer to create a new object from a single roughness value, from an image texture, or from both.

If you specify `texture`, RealityKit calculates the `roughness` for the entity by UV-mapping `texture` onto the entity and multiplying the value of each mapped pixel by `scale`. If you don’t specify `texture`, then RealityKit uses `scale` as the entire entity’s roughness. If you provide a color image for `texture` rather than a grayscale image, RealityKit only uses the intensity of the image’s red channel.
