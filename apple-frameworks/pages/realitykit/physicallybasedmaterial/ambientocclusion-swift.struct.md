# PhysicallyBasedMaterial.AmbientOcclusion

**Framework:** RealityKit  
**Kind:** Structure  
**Availability:** iOS 15.0+ · iPadOS 15.0+ · Mac Catalyst 15.0+ · macOS 12.0+ · tvOS 26.0+ · visionOS

An object that defines the ambient occlusion of an entity’s surface.

## Declaration

```swift
struct AmbientOcclusion
```

## Topics

### Creating an ambient occlusion object

- [init(texture:)](ambientocclusion-swift.struct/init%28texture_%29.md): Creates an object from an image texture.
- [init(\_:)](ambientocclusion-swift.struct/init%28__%29.md): Creates an object from a custom material’s ambient occlusion property.

### Accessing ambient occlusion values

- [texture](ambientocclusion-swift.struct/texture.md): The amount of ambient occlusion specified using a UV-mapped image.
- [textureSemantic](ambientocclusion-swift.struct/texturesemantic.md): The intended use of the object’s texture property.
