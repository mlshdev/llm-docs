# PhysicallyBasedMaterial.AnisotropyLevel

**Framework:** RealityKit  
**Kind:** Structure  
**Availability:** iOS 15.0+ · iPadOS 15.0+ · Mac Catalyst 15.0+ · macOS 12.0+ · tvOS 26.0+ · visionOS

An object that defines the degree to which an entity reflects light to create stretched or oblong highlights.

## Declaration

```swift
struct AnisotropyLevel
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

By default, PBR materials are isotropic; in other words, an entity that uses [PhysicallyBasedMaterial](../physicallybasedmaterial.md) reflects light uniformly in all directions, mimicking the behavior of most real-world objects. Some objects, including those with many small parallel striations such as vinyl records, CDs, or straight hair, reflect light more in some directions than others, resulting in stretched or oblong specular highlights, as shown in the following figure.

Use this object to specify the [anisotropyLevel](anisotropylevel-swift.property.md) for a material.

## Topics

### Creating an anisotropy level object

- [init(floatLiteral:)](anisotropylevel-swift.struct/init%28floatliteral_%29.md): Creates an anisotropy level object from a single value.
- [init(scale:texture:)](anisotropylevel-swift.struct/init%28scale_texture_%29.md): Creates an anisotropy level object using a single value or a texture.

### Accessing anisotropy level values

- [texture](anisotropylevel-swift.struct/texture.md): The anisotropy level values specified using a UV-mapped image.
- [textureSemantic](anisotropylevel-swift.struct/texturesemantic.md): The intended use of the object’s texture property.
- [scale](anisotropylevel-swift.struct/scale.md): The anistropy level specified as a single value.
