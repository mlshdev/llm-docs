# PerspectiveCameraComponent

**Framework:** RealityKit  
**Kind:** Structure  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 26.0+ · visionOS

A component that defines a virtual camera and its controls.

## Declaration

```swift
struct PerspectiveCameraComponent
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Each scene requires a camera that defines the viewpoint from which RealityKit renders the scene. In RealityKit, the default camera is a *perspective camera*, which simulates the way real cameras and human vision work. Entities that are farther away from the camera render smaller.

For an alternative camera solution, see [OrthographicCameraComponent](orthographiccameracomponent.md).

To create a perspective camera, add this component to an entity.

```swift
let cameraEntity = Entity()

// Place the camera 2 meters along the z-axis,
// looking at the scene origin.
let cameraPosition: SIMD3<Float> = [0, 0, 2]
cameraEntity.look(at: .zero, from: cameraPosition, relativeTo: nil)

cameraEntity.components.set(PerspectiveCameraComponent())
```

A `PerspectiveCameraComponent` defines the camera settings for a perspective camera, such as the [fieldOfViewInDegrees](perspectivecameracomponent/fieldofviewindegrees.md). The entity’s [transform](hastransform/transform.md) defines the camera entity’s viewpoint and direction. The direction it points is along the entity’s negative z-axis.

In AR scenarios, the system provides the camera automatically; however, in non-AR scenarios, the app needs to set the camera. If the app doesn’t provide a camera, the system uses the default perspective camera.

## Topics

### Creating a camera component

- [init(near:far:fieldOfViewInDegrees:)](perspectivecameracomponent/init%28near_far_fieldofviewindegrees_%29.md): Creates a perspective camera component from near and far clipping planes and a field of view.
- [init(near:far:fieldOfViewInDegrees:fieldOfViewOrientation:)](perspectivecameracomponent/init%28near_far_fieldofviewindegrees_fieldofvieworientation_%29.md): Creates a perspective camera component from near and far clipping planes, a field of view, and an orientation.

### Setting focal points

- [far](perspectivecameracomponent/far.md): The maximum distance in meters from the camera that the camera can see.
- [near](perspectivecameracomponent/near.md): The minimum distance in meters from the camera that the camera can see.

### Setting the field of view

- [fieldOfViewInDegrees](perspectivecameracomponent/fieldofviewindegrees.md): The camera’s total field of view in degrees.
- [fieldOfViewOrientation](perspectivecameracomponent/fieldofvieworientation.md): The orientation with which the system uses to apply the field-of-view degrees.
