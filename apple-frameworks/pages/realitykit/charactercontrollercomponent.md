# CharacterControllerComponent

**Framework:** RealityKit  
**Kind:** Structure  
**Availability:** iOS 15.0+ · iPadOS 15.0+ · Mac Catalyst 15.0+ · macOS 12.0+ · tvOS 26.0+ · visionOS

A component that manages character movement.

## Declaration

```swift
struct CharacterControllerComponent
```

## Overview

To use a character controller, add a `CharacterControllerComponent` to your entity to make it a character entity. Use [moveCharacter(by:deltaTime:relativeTo:collisionHandler:)](entity/movecharacter%28by_deltatime_relativeto_collisionhandler_%29.md) to move your character and respond to collisions, or [teleportCharacter(to:relativeTo:)](entity/teleportcharacter%28to_relativeto_%29.md) to place your character instantaneously in 3D space.

> **Note**

> [PhysicsBodyComponent](physicsbodycomponent.md) and [CollisionComponent](collisioncomponent.md) are incompatible with `CharacterControllerComponent`, and RealityKit deactivates them if you add them to the same entity.

## Handle collision

Character entities are capsular, and you can specify their height and radius in the component’s initializer. A character’s capsule shape aligns with its [upVector](charactercontrollercomponent/upvector.md) so that the top and bottom of the capsule pass through that direction vector.

Although characters don’t have a `CollisionComponent`, they can still interact with colliders. The collision handler in `moveCharacter(by:deltaTime:relativeTo:collisionHandler:)` allows you to respond to collisions with solid colliders in your scene.

```swift
entity.moveCharacter(by: velocity * deltaTime, deltaTime: deltaTime, relativeTo: nil) {
    event in
    // Your character collided with `event.hitEntity`.
}
```

To handle collisions with colliders that have a [mode](collisioncomponent/mode-swift.property.md) of [CollisionComponent.Mode.trigger](collisioncomponent/mode-swift.enum/trigger.md), subscribe to the [CollisionEvents.Began](collisionevents/began.md) event for your [RealityView](realityview.md). This event doesn’t occur for solid collisions with your character, but RealityKit invokes it when your character enters a trigger. This is useful for collecting coins, claiming checkpoints, activating enemy behavior when your character enters an area, and many other interactions within games.

## Update your character

A common use case for `CharacterControllerComponent` is to control a character in a video game. Video games have update loops where characters and game logic update once each frame, allowing them to respond to player input in real time. `CharacterControllerComponent` works well in such a setup.

To move your character in response to player input, subscribe to [PhysicsSimulationEvents.WillSimulate](physicssimulationevents/willsimulate.md) on [RealityViewContent](realityviewcontent.md) for your scene. The event object contains information like the time delta since the last update, and you can treat this callback as the update loop for your game.

> **Note**

> You can also use [SceneEvents.Update](sceneevents/update.md) to run code for each frame, but avoid using it to control physics-based motion in your scene.

Read the values from [CharacterControllerStateComponent](charactercontrollerstatecomponent.md) to accumulate forces (such as gravity) and to check whether the character is on the ground. RealityKit calculates [isOnGround](charactercontrollerstatecomponent/isonground.md) and  [velocity](charactercontrollerstatecomponent/velocity.md) only after you call `moveCharacter(by:deltaTime:relativeTo:collisionHandler:)`, so it’s a good idea to call this function at each update.

```swift
let gravity: SIMD3<Float> = [0, -50, 0]
let jumpSpeed: Float = 10
content.subscribe(to: PhysicsSimulationEvents.WillSimulate.self, on: playerEntity) {
    event in
    let deltaTime: Float = event.deltaTime
    var velocity: SIMD3<Float> = .zero
    var isOnGround: Bool = false

    // RealityKit automatically adds `CharacterControllerStateComponent` after moving the character for the first time.
    if let ccState = playerEntity.components[CharacterControllerStateComponent.self] {
        velocity = ccState.velocity
        isOnGround = ccState.isOnGround
    }

    if !isOnGround {
        // Gravity is a force, so you need to accumulate it for each frame.
        velocity += gravity * deltaTime
    } else if myPlayerInput.jump {
        // Set the character's velocity directly to launch it in the air when the player jumps.
        velocity.y = jumpSpeed
    }

    playerEntity.moveCharacter(by: velocity * deltaTime, deltaTime: deltaTime, relativeTo: nil) {
        event in
        print("playerEntity collided with \(event.hitEntity.name)")
    }
}
```

## Topics

### Creating a character controller component

- [init()](charactercontrollercomponent/init%28%29.md): Creates a character controller component using default values.
- [init(radius:height:skinWidth:slopeLimit:stepLimit:upVector:collisionFilter:)](charactercontrollercomponent/init%28radius_height_skinwidth_slopelimit_steplimit_upvector_collisionfilter_%29.md): Creates a character controller component using specified values.

### Configuring a character

- [height](charactercontrollercomponent/height.md): The capsule height.
- [radius](charactercontrollercomponent/radius.md): The capsule radius.
- [skinWidth](charactercontrollercomponent/skinwidth.md): An added tolerance around the character capsule.
- [slopeLimit](charactercontrollercomponent/slopelimit.md): The slope limit expressed as a limit angle in radians.
- [stepLimit](charactercontrollercomponent/steplimit.md): The maximum obstacle height that the controller can move over.
- [upVector](charactercontrollercomponent/upvector.md): The y-axis direction relative to the physics origin.

### Managing character collisions

- [collisionFilter](charactercontrollercomponent/collisionfilter.md): The character’s collision filter.

### Reading default values

- [defaultHeight](charactercontrollercomponent/defaultheight.md): The capsule height value RealityKit applies when you use the default initializer.
- [defaultRadius](charactercontrollercomponent/defaultradius.md): The capsule default radius RealityKit applies when you use the default initializer.
- [defaultSkinWidth](charactercontrollercomponent/defaultskinwidth.md): The skin width value RealityKit applies when you use the default initializer.
- [defaultSlopeLimit](charactercontrollercomponent/defaultslopelimit.md): The slope limit value RealityKit applies when you use the default initializer.
- [defaultStepLimit](charactercontrollercomponent/defaultsteplimit.md): The step limit value RealityKit applies when you use the default initializer.
- [defaultUpVector](charactercontrollercomponent/defaultupvector.md): The default up vector RealityKit applies when you use the default initializer.

### Animating a character

- [JointTransforms](jointtransforms.md): A set of animatable transform values for joints that collectively represent a single skeletal pose.

### Handling collisions

- [CharacterControllerComponent.Collision](charactercontrollercomponent/collision.md): A container that holds collision state for the character controller.
- [CharacterControllerComponent.CollisionFlags](charactercontrollercomponent/collisionflags.md): An option set that specifies which parts of the character capsule have collided with other objects.
