# ImagePresentationComponent.Spatial3DImage

**Framework:** RealityKit  
**Kind:** Class  
**Availability:** visionOS 26.0+

A 3D spatial scene created from a 2D image.

## Declaration

```swift
class Spatial3DImage
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Create and generate a `Spatial3DImage`  to present a *spatial scene* in RealityKit. Spatial scenes are a 3D representation of a 2D image or photo which RealityKit renders with depth and motion parallax.

### Spatial scene generation

To present a `Spatial3DImage` as a spatial scene, you must first *generate* it. Call the [generate()](spatial3dimage/generate%28%29.md) method to generate an in-memory representation of a spatial scene from the original image. Generation can take a few seconds to complete.

> **Note**

> You can’t generate a `Spatial3DImage` with the visionOS Simulator. You can create and work with `Spatial3DImage` instances in the Simulator, but calling the [generate()](spatial3dimage/generate%28%29.md) method throws an error.

You can choose to pre-generate a spatial scene in advance of presentation, or post-generate it in response to an interaction such as someone pressing a button.

In either case, start by creating a new `Spatial3DImage` from a local file URL for an existing image, or from an existing `CGImageSource`.

To pre-generate and present the image as a spatial scene, call the [generate()](spatial3dimage/generate%28%29.md) method on the `Spatial3DImage` to generate its in-memory spatial scene representation. Next, use the [init(spatial3DImage:)](init%28spatial3dimage_%29.md) initializer to create an [ImagePresentationComponent](../imagepresentationcomponent.md) from the generated `Spatial3DImage`. Set the component’s [desiredViewingMode](desiredviewingmode.md) to [spatial3D](viewingmode-swift.struct/spatial3d.md) or [spatial3DImmersive](viewingmode-swift.struct/spatial3dimmersive.md), then add the component to an entity to present the spatial scene immediately.

To post-generate a spatial scene, create a new [ImagePresentationComponent](../imagepresentationcomponent.md) from the `Spatial3DImage` *before* generating it, and add the component to an entity. By default, the component displays the image with a monoscopic ([mono](viewingmode-swift.struct/mono.md)) viewing mode. If you created the image from a spatial photo, you can choose to present the `Spatial3DImage` as a spatial photo instead by setting the component’s [desiredViewingMode](desiredviewingmode.md) to [spatialStereo](viewingmode-swift.struct/spatialstereo.md) or [spatialStereoImmersive](viewingmode-swift.struct/spatialstereoimmersive.md).

In your app’s UI, add a button or other trigger to convert the image to 3D. When someone presses the button, set the component’s [desiredViewingMode](desiredviewingmode.md) to [spatial3D](viewingmode-swift.struct/spatial3d.md) or [spatial3DImmersive](viewingmode-swift.struct/spatial3dimmersive.md), to indicate that you want the component to present the spatial scene as soon as the app finishes generating it. Then, call the [generate()](spatial3dimage/generate%28%29.md) method to begin the generation process. The component displays a generation animation, similar to the Photos app on visionOS, and transitions to presenting the spatial scene as soon as generation completes.

> **Note**

> Spatial scenes are created by an AI algorithm that leverages computational depth to create multiple perspectives of a 2D photo. In some cases, spatial scenes may contain visual artifacts. When you include a spatial scene in your app’s UI, consider providing a button to switch to the original 2D photo instead, by setting the component’s [desiredViewingMode](desiredviewingmode.md) to [mono](viewingmode-swift.struct/mono.md).

## Topics

### Creating a spatial scene from a 2D image or spatial photo

- [init(contentsOf:)](spatial3dimage/init%28contentsof_%29.md): Initializes a spatial 3D image from the contents of an image file.
- [init(imageSource:)](spatial3dimage/init%28imagesource_%29.md): Initializes a spatial 3D image from the contents of an image source.

### Generating a spatial scene

- [generate()](spatial3dimage/generate%28%29.md): Creates a 3D representation of the image if one does not already exist.
