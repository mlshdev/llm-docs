# LowLevelMesh.VertexSemantic

**Framework:** RealityKit  
**Kind:** Enumeration  
**Availability:** iOS 18.0+ · iPadOS 18.0+ · Mac Catalyst 18.0+ · macOS 15.0+ · tvOS 26.0+ · visionOS 2.0+

Designates the intended usage of a vertex attribute.

## Declaration

```swift
enum VertexSemantic
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

RealityKit consults the vertex semantic when interpreting the data in your [LowLevelMesh](../lowlevelmesh.md). For example, an attribute with the semantic value of [LowLevelMesh.VertexSemantic.position](vertexsemantic/position.md) determines the position of a vertex.

## Topics

### Specifying intended use

- [LowLevelMesh.VertexSemantic.bitangent](vertexsemantic/bitangent.md): The semantic for surface bitangent vector data.
- [LowLevelMesh.VertexSemantic.color](vertexsemantic/color.md): The semantic for per-vertex color data.
- [LowLevelMesh.VertexSemantic.normal](vertexsemantic/normal.md): The semantic for surface normal data.
- [LowLevelMesh.VertexSemantic.position](vertexsemantic/position.md): The semantic for vertex position data.
- [LowLevelMesh.VertexSemantic.tangent](vertexsemantic/tangent.md): The semantic for surface tangent vector data.
- [LowLevelMesh.VertexSemantic.unspecified](vertexsemantic/unspecified.md): The semantic that doesn’t specify the role of the vertex.
- [LowLevelMesh.VertexSemantic.uv0](vertexsemantic/uv0.md): The semantic for the first UV channel, also known as UV0.
- [LowLevelMesh.VertexSemantic.uv1](vertexsemantic/uv1.md): The semantic for the second UV channel, also known as UV1.
- [LowLevelMesh.VertexSemantic.uv2](vertexsemantic/uv2.md): The semantic for the third UV channel, also known as UV2.
- [LowLevelMesh.VertexSemantic.uv3](vertexsemantic/uv3.md): The semantic for the fourth UV channel, also known as UV3.
- [LowLevelMesh.VertexSemantic.uv4](vertexsemantic/uv4.md): The semantic for the fifth UV channel, also known as UV4.
- [LowLevelMesh.VertexSemantic.uv5](vertexsemantic/uv5.md): The semantic for the sixth UV channel, also known as UV5.
- [LowLevelMesh.VertexSemantic.uv6](vertexsemantic/uv6.md): The semantic for the seventh UV channel, also known as UV6.
- [LowLevelMesh.VertexSemantic.uv7](vertexsemantic/uv7.md): The semantic for the eighth UV channel, also known as UV7.
