# AnimationView

**Framework:** RealityKit  
**Kind:** Structure  
**Availability:** iOS 15.0+ · iPadOS 15.0+ · Mac Catalyst 15.0+ · macOS 12.0+ · tvOS 26.0+ · visionOS

An animation that represents a variation of another animation.

## Declaration

```swift
struct AnimationView
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

This structure creates a variation of an existing animation by overriding its configuration. The term *view* in the name signifies that the variation represents a new visual perspective of the existing animation.

### Create a clip of an animation

By supplying a new beginning time ([trimStart](animationview/trimstart.md)) and ending time ([trimEnd](animationview/trimend.md)), the following code creates a shorter clip of an existing animation. With [trimStart](animationview/trimstart.md) set to `1.0` and [trimEnd](animationview/trimend.md) at `2.0`, the clip spans a one-second duration.

```swift
// Create or access an existing animation.
let anim1 = FromToByAnimation<Float>(name: "Anim1",
    from: 100.0, to: 200.0, duration: 10.0)

// Use a view to create a clip of the original animation.
let view = AnimationView(source: anim1,
    name: "clip",
    bindTarget: nil,
    blendLayer: 0,
    repeatMode: .autoReverse,
    fillMode: [],
    trimStart: 1.0,
    trimEnd: 2.0,
    trimDuration: nil,
    offset: 0,
    delay: 0,
    speed: 1.0)

// Create an animation resource from the clip.
clipResource = try? AnimationResource.generate(with: view)

// Play the clip.
myModelEntity.playAnimation(clipResource)
```

### Define a view in relation to the animation source

The source animation’s timing properties define a *timeline* on which the [trimDuration](animationview/trimduration.md), [delay](animationview/delay.md), and [speed](animationview/speed.md) properties operate to derive the view. The [trimDuration](animationview/trimduration.md) property specifies which animation data the view displays. If [trimDuration](animationview/trimduration.md) exceeds the length of the source animation’s timeline, the animation plays according to the characteristics of [repeatMode](animationview/repeatmode.md). The [delay](animationview/delay.md) property defines a waiting period before the animation begins, and the [speed](animationview/speed.md) determines how fast the view plays in relation to the original pace.

## Topics

### Creating an animation view

- [init(source:name:bindTarget:blendLayer:repeatMode:fillMode:trimStart:trimEnd:trimDuration:offset:delay:speed:)](animationview/init%28source_name_bindtarget_blendlayer_repeatmode_fillmode_trimstart_trimend_trimduration_offset_delay_speed_%29.md): Creates a variation of the given animation by overriding its properties.

### Configuring the animation view

- [source](animationview/source.md): The original animation that this structure modifies.
- [name](animationview/name.md): A textual name for the animation.
- [bindTarget](animationview/bindtarget.md): A textual name that identifies the animated property.
- [blendLayer](animationview/blendlayer.md): The order in which the framework composites the animation.

### Timing the animation

- [speed](animationview/speed.md): A factor that increases or decreases the animation’s rate of playback.
- [delay](animationview/delay.md): An amount of time that lapses before the animation plays.
- [duration](animationview/duration.md): The total playback time of the animation.
- [offset](animationview/offset.md): The time, in seconds, at which the animation begins within the duration.
- [trimDuration](animationview/trimduration.md): An optional duration that overrides the calculated duration.
- [trimStart](animationview/trimstart.md): The time, in seconds, at which the source animation plays.
- [trimEnd](animationview/trimend.md): The time, in seconds, at which the source animation stops.

### Repeating animation playback

- [repeatMode](animationview/repeatmode.md): An option that determines how the animation repeats.
- [fillMode](animationview/fillmode.md): An option that determines which data displays outside of the normal duration.
