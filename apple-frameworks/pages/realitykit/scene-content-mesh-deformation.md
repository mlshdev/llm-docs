# Mesh deformation

**Framework:** RealityKit  
**Kind:** API Collection

Reshape and animate the geometry of 3D models at runtime, applying skinning, blend shapes, and subdivision so surfaces bend, flex, and deform as a scene plays.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

This collection covers the building blocks for modifying the vertices of a model after it loads, letting you drive lifelike motion such as characters bending, faces emoting, or surfaces smoothing in real time. It includes a configurable pipeline of stages that transform geometry, options for choosing where and how that work runs on the processor or graphics hardware, and lower-level entry points for fine-grained control over the transformation. Reach for these tools when prebaked animation is not enough and you need to compute or adjust a model’s shape dynamically. They give you control over performance trade-offs and the order in which transformations apply.

## Topics

### Deformers

- [MeshDeformerComponent](meshdeformercomponent.md): The component that applies mesh deformations to an `Entity`.
- [MeshDeformer](meshdeformer.md): An interface for all deformation types in a deformation definition, both built-in and custom. The users overrides all functions to implement a custom `MeshDeformer`, and can in general ignore all but the constructors for built-in deformers.
- [SkinningDeformer](skinningdeformer.md): A deformation that binds a 3D mesh to an underlying skeleton.
- [BlendShapeDeformer](blendshapedeformer.md): A blend-shape deformation that interpolates between N meshes according to a weighted sum. Consumes information from the `BlendShapeWeightsComponent`

### Parameters and options

- [MeshDeformerOptions](meshdeformeroptions.md): Specifies constant options for `MeshDeformer`
- [MeshDeformerVertexOptions](meshdeformervertexoptions.md): MeshDeformerVertexOptions allows developers to specify which vertex types in the mesh to allocate in the input and output buffers for mesh deformations.
- [MeshDeformerExecutionMode](meshdeformerexecutionmode.md): Specifies which `MesDeformer.deform` function will be called when used with custom deformers.
- [MeshDeformParameter](meshdeformparameter.md): Base class for GPU and CPU custom deform function input
- [MeshDeformationStack](meshdeformationstack.md): A set of `MeshDeformer`s to apply in order to a mesh, or a proper subset of the mesh specified by `Target`s. If at any point, a deformer in the stack updates, all deformers later in the stack will also update.
- [MeshScope](meshscope.md): The elements of a mesh resource that a deformation stack applies to.
- [MeshDeformParameterCPU](meshdeformparametercpu.md): convenience alias
- [MeshDeformParameterGPU](meshdeformparametergpu.md): convenience alias
- [MeshDeformParametersCPU](meshdeformparameterscpu.md): convenience alias
- [MeshDeformParametersGPU](meshdeformparametersgpu.md): convenience alias
- [MeshDeformCPUBufferInput](meshdeformcpubufferinput.md): The underlying type of deformer input data buffers for the CPU functions.
- [MeshDeformGPUBufferInput](meshdeformgpubufferinput.md): The underlying type of deformer input data buffers for the GPU functions.
- [MeshDeformCPUBufferOutput](meshdeformcpubufferoutput.md): The underlying type of deformer output data buffers for the CPU functions.
- [MeshDeformGPUBufferOutput](meshdeformgpubufferoutput.md): The underlying type of deformer input data buffers for the GPU functions.

### Low-level deformation

- [LowLevelDeformation](lowleveldeformation.md): An object that encodes blend-shape, skinning, and renormalization passes into a Metal compute command encoder.
- [LowLevelDeformationContext](lowleveldeformationcontext.md): An object that manages shared resources for [LowLevelDeformation](lowleveldeformation.md) instances.
