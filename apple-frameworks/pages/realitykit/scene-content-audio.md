# Audio

**Framework:** RealityKit  
**Kind:** API Collection

Create personalized and realistic spatial audio experiences.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

Creating a compelling audio experience with RealityKit is as simple as playing audio on your existing RealityKit entities. Use RealityKit’s default audio settings to create a personalized and realistic experience or utilize advanced customization options to tailor the audio for the needs of your application. Utilizing acoustic ray tracing and a personalized HRTF, RealityKit provides lifelike and high-quality sound.

You can load and configure audio with an [AudioResource](audioresource.md) subclass, such as [AudioFileResource](audiofileresource.md), and adjust the spatial rendering with [SpatialAudioComponent](spatialaudiocomponent.md), [AmbientAudioComponent](ambientaudiocomponent.md), [ChannelAudioComponent](channelaudiocomponent.md). Control the audio resource playback with [AudioPlaybackController](audioplaybackcontroller.md). For real-time audio playback you can prepare a [Audio.GeneratorRenderHandler](audio/generatorrenderhandler.md) and control playback with [AudioGeneratorController](audiogeneratorcontroller.md). You can control the playback levels of multiple resources at once with [AudioMixGroup](audiomixgroup.md) and [AudioMixGroupsComponent](audiomixgroupscomponent.md).

- [Reverb.Preset](reverb/preset.md): Reverbs defined by a preset environment.
- [ReverbComponent](reverbcomponent.md): A component that defines the reverberation of spatial audio sources.

### Audio mixing

- [Mixing spatial music](mixing-spatial-music.md): Preview ray-traced reverb by adjusting a spatialized multitrack audio mix in an immersive scene.
- [AudioMixGroup](audiomixgroup.md): A group that manages the playback properties of multiple playing sounds.
