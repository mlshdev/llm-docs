# init(cubeFromEquirectangular:named:quality:faceSize:options:)

**Framework:** RealityKit  
**Kind:** Initializer  
**Availability:** iOS 18.0+ · iPadOS 18.0+ · Mac Catalyst 18.0+ · macOS 15.0+ · tvOS 26.0+ · visionOS 2.0+

Asynchronously creates a cube texture resource from an equirectangular image.

## Declaration

```swift
@MainActor @preconcurrency convenience init(cubeFromEquirectangular cgImage: CGImage, named resourceName: String? = nil, quality: TextureResource.SamplingQuality = .fast, faceSize: Int? = nil, options: TextureResource.CreateOptions) async throws
```

## Parameters

- `cgImage`: The source image.
- `resourceName`: A unique name for syncing the texture resource across the network. The name is empty if you don’t include one.
- `quality`: The sampling quality the initializer applies as it generates the cube texture.
- `faceSize`: The dimension of a cube face. When `faceSize` is `nil`, RealityKit computes the size based on the equirectangular image’s dimensions. RealityKit clamps the value to the source image’s height. For best results, pass values that are one-third of the cubeʻs width or less.
- `options`: A configuration for generating the texture.

## Discussion

RealityKit samples the source equirectangular image at the specified quality level to generate the cube texture.

The equirectangular image, also known as a *latitude-longitude image*, contains a flattened map of the surroundings where:

- The width is a `360°` clockwise scan along the horizon, starting from behind (+z-axis)
- The height is a -90° (bottom) to +90° (top) vertical scan

To preserve all details equirectangular images require a `2:1` aspect ratio.

Use the resulting texture to create an [EnvironmentResource](../environmentresource.md), or assign it to a material in Reality Composer Pro that requires a cube texture type.

```swift
if let source = CGImageSourceCreateWithURL(url as CFURL, nil),
    let image = CGImageSourceCreateImageAtIndex(source, 0, nil) {

    // Create a cube texture from the image.
    let cube = try await TextureResource(
        cubeFromEquirectangular: image, quality: .normal,
        options: TextureResource.CreateOptions(semantic: .hdrColor))

    // Create an environment resource from the cube texture.
    let environment = try await EnvironmentResource(
        cube: cube, options: EnvironmentResource.CreateOptions())

    await MainActor.run {
        // Assign the environment to an image-based light component.
        let lightEntity = Entity()
        lightEntity.components.set(
            ImageBasedLightComponent(source: .single(environment)))
        ...
    }
}
```

> **Note**

> [EnvironmentResource.CreateOptions.SamplingQuality.high](../environmentresource/createoptions/samplingquality-swift.enum/high.md) and [EnvironmentResource.CreateOptions.SamplingQuality.veryHigh](../environmentresource/createoptions/samplingquality-swift.enum/veryhigh.md), along with [astc(blockSize:quality:)](compression/astc%28blocksize_quality_%29.md) compression options, are only available in macOS. Use these options to write optimized scenes for all target platforms when exporting from macOS with [write(to:)](../entity/write%28to_%29.md). Compression options also significantly reduce a cube’s memory and disk usage.
