# PresentationComponent

**Framework:** RealityKit  
**Kind:** Structure  
**Availability:** visionOS 26.0+

A component that presents a SwiftUI modal presentation from a RealityKit entity.

## Declaration

```swift
struct PresentationComponent
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Popovers that this component presents initially rotate themselves to face the active camera and appear with a breakthrough effect by default. To change the breakthrough effect on the presented view, use the `presentationBreakthroughEffect` modifier, like in the following example:

```
var presentationComponent = PresentationComponent(
    configuration: .popover(arrowEdge: .bottom),
    content: PresentedView()
        .glassBackgroundEffect()
        .presentationBreakthroughEffect(.prominent)
)
```

For presentations that opt out of breakthrough effects, consider applying breakthrough effects to the main elements of the view, to ensure that the occluding content doesn’t clip the content within the presentation:

```
HStack {
    Text(title)
        .breakthroughEffect(.subtle)

    Button(action: action, label: label)
        .breakthroughEffect(.subtle)
}
.glassBackgroundEffect()
.presentationBreakthroughEffect(.none)
```

To make the presentation continuously face the active camera, add a [BillboardComponent](billboardcomponent.md) to the same entity that contains the `PresentationComponent`:

```
entity.add(presentationComponent)
entity.add(BillboardComponent())
```

> **Note**

## Topics

### Structures

- [PresentationComponent.Configuration](presentationcomponent/configuration.md): A configuration that specifies the modality, appearance, and behavior of the presentation.

### Initializers

- [init(configuration:content:)](presentationcomponent/init%28configuration_content_%29.md): Present `content` using modality and options specified by `configuration`. A component created using this method will have its `isPresented` property default to `true`, which means it will present as soon as an entity with the component is added to the hierarchy.
- [init(isPresented:configuration:content:)](presentationcomponent/init%28ispresented_configuration_content_%29.md): Present `content` when a binding that you provide is `true`, using modality and options specified by `configuration`.

### Instance Properties

- [isPresented](presentationcomponent/ispresented.md): A boolean value that indicates whether the content is presented.

## Relationships

### Conforms To

- [Component](component.md)
- [TransientComponent](transientcomponent.md)

- [Attachment](attachment.md): An attachment content you can use to gather an identifier and view.
- [RealityViewAttachments](realityviewattachments.md): The attachments that belong to a RealityView.
- [ViewAttachmentEntity](viewattachmententity.md): An entity that has a view attachment.
- [ViewAttachmentComponent](viewattachmentcomponent.md): A component containing additional information about a view attachment entity provided via the [entity(for:)](realityviewattachments/entity%28for_%29.md) function.
- [TextComponent](textcomponent.md): A component that draws 2D text at an entity’s location.
