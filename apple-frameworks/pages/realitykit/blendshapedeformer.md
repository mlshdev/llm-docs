### Deformers

- [MeshDeformerComponent](meshdeformercomponent.md): The component that applies mesh deformations to an `Entity`.
- [MeshDeformer](meshdeformer.md): An interface for all deformation types in a deformation definition, both built-in and custom. The users overrides all functions to implement a custom `MeshDeformer`, and can in general ignore all but the constructors for built-in deformers.
