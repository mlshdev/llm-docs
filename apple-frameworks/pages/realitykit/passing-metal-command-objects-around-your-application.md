# Passing Metal command objects around your application

**Framework:** RealityKit  
**Kind:** Article

Build a system that creates and passes Metal command objects to entities dispatching Metal compute shaders.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

To dispatch a Metal compute shader function, you need a command queue, a command buffer, and a compute command encoder. Creating these command objects comes at a cost, so avoid making them on demand whenever you need to dispatch a compute shader function (see [Setting Up a Command Structure](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/gpu_devices_and_work_submission/setting_up_a_command_structure)). Instead, for single-threaded apps, employ a single command queue for the entirety of the application, as well as a single command buffer and compute command encoder for all compute commands that you dispatch in every frame.

The [Generating interactive geometry with RealityKit](generating-interactive-geometry-with-realitykit.md) sample demonstrates one possible approach to managing the life cycle and injection of these command objects throughout an application. Leverage RealityKit’s [Entity Component System](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/system) (ECS) to pass an [MTLCommandBuffer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlcommandbuffer) and an [MTLComputeCommandEncoder](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlcomputecommandencoder) to each entity dispatching compute shaders in every frame, while maintaining a single global [MTLCommandQueue](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlcommandqueue) for the entire application.

## Define a compute system protocol

Start by creating a structure that contains the context necessary to dispatch compute shader functions in every frame:

```swift
/// A structure containing the context a `ComputeSystem` needs to dispatch compute commands in every frame.
struct ComputeUpdateContext {
    /// The number of seconds elapsed since the last frame.
    let deltaTime: TimeInterval
    /// The command buffer for the current frame.
    let commandBuffer: MTLCommandBuffer
    /// The compute command encoder for the current frame.
    let computeEncoder: MTLComputeCommandEncoder
}
```

You can choose not to include the `deltaTime` property in your structure, or you can add additional properties, such as [SceneUpdateContext](sceneupdatecontext.md).

Next, define a protocol with an update method that takes `ComputeUpdateContext` as a parameter:

```swift
/// A protocol that enables its adoptees to dispatch their own compute commands in every frame.
protocol ComputeSystem {
    @MainActor
    func update(computeContext: ComputeUpdateContext)
}
```

## Dispatch compute systems with RealityKit’s ECS

Create a component that holds a `ComputeSystem`:

```swift
/// A component that contains a `ComputeSystem`.
struct ComputeSystemComponent: Component {
    let computeSystem: ComputeSystem
}
```

Then, create a custom [System](system.md) that finds all entities with a `ComputeSystemComponent` in every frame and passes that frame’s `ComputeUpdateContext` to their `ComputeSystem` instances:

```swift
/// A class that updates the `ComputeSystem` of each `ComputeSystemComponent` with `ComputeUpdateContext` in every frame.
class ComputeDispatchSystem: System {
    /// The application's command queue.
    ///
    /// A single, global command queue to use throughout the entire application.
    static let commandQueue: MTLCommandQueue? = makeCommandQueue(labeled: "Compute Dispatch System Command Queue")
    
    /// The query this system uses to get all entities with a `ComputeSystemComponent` in every frame.
    let query = EntityQuery(where: .has(ComputeSystemComponent.self))
    
    required init(scene: Scene) { }
    
    /// Updates all compute systems with the current frame's `ComputeUpdateContext`.
    func update(context: SceneUpdateContext) {
        // Get all entities with a `ComputeSystemComponent` in every frame.
        let computeSystemEntities = context.entities(matching: query, updatingSystemWhen: .rendering)
        
        // Create the command buffer and compute encoder responsible for dispatching all compute commands this frame.
        guard let commandBuffer = Self.commandQueue?.makeCommandBuffer(),
              let computeEncoder = commandBuffer.makeComputeCommandEncoder() else {
            return
        }
        
        // Enqueue the command buffer.
        commandBuffer.enqueue()
        
        // Dispatch all compute systems to encode their compute commands.
        let computeContext = ComputeUpdateContext(deltaTime: context.deltaTime,
                                                  commandBuffer: commandBuffer,
                                                  computeEncoder: computeEncoder)
        for computeSystemEntity in computeSystemEntities {
            if let computeSystemComponent = computeSystemEntity.components[ComputeSystemComponent.self] {
                computeSystemComponent.computeSystem.update(computeContext: computeContext)
            }
        }
        
        // Stop encoding compute commands and commit them to run on the GPU.
        computeEncoder.endEncoding()
        commandBuffer.commit()
    }
}
```

In this example, a helper method assists in the creation of the Metal command queue:

```swift
/// The device Metal selects as the default.
let metalDevice: MTLDevice? = MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice()

/// Makes a command queue with the given label.
func makeCommandQueue(labeled label: String) -> MTLCommandQueue? {
    guard let metalDevice, let queue = metalDevice.makeCommandQueue() else {
        return nil
    }
    queue.label = label
    return queue
}
```

## Create a custom compute system

You can dispatch your compute shader functions in every frame by creating a custom `ComputeSystem` and implementing its `update` method:

```swift
struct MyComputeSystem: ComputeSystem {
    func update(computeContext: ComputeUpdateContext) {
        // Dispatch compute shader functions here.
    }
}
```

Be sure to register the `ComputeDispatchSystem` so that the `update` method fires every frame:

```swift
ComputeDispatchSystem.registerSystem()
```

Finally, attach your custom `ComputeSystem` to an entity with a `ComputeSystemComponent`:

```swift
let myComputeSystem = MyComputeSystem()
let myComputeEntity = Entity()
myComputeEntity.components.set(ComputeSystemComponent(computeSystem: myComputeSystem))
```
