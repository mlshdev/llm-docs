# Materials, textures, and shaders

**Framework:** RealityKit  
**Kind:** API Collection

Apply textures to the surface of your scene’s 3D objects to give each object a unique appearance.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

Materials define the appearance of 3D models in RealityKit, by defining how their surfaces interact with light. Materials can also occlude objects behind them, hold shaders, or act as portals to view other worlds with [PortalMaterial](portalmaterial.md).

RealityKit includes a few material types to help you get started, including [SimpleMaterial](simplematerial.md) for basic color and textures, and [PhysicallyBasedMaterial](physicallybasedmaterial.md) for realistic lighting effects such as reflections, roughness, and emission.

### Decals

- [PhysicallyBasedDecalComponent](physicallybaseddecalcomponent.md): A component that specifies a decal to be applied on the scene. A decal is essentially a projective texture applied to any mesh on the scene. The transform of the decal is inherited from the entity’s transform. The decal is projected along the local space negative z onto the meshes within its volume. All decal textures expect 2D texture resources. Decal textures do not support custom sampler, UV index, or swizzle options from [PhysicallyBasedMaterial](physicallybasedmaterial.md) parameter types. All textures are sampled using bilinear filtering, projected UVs from the decal volume, and fixed channel mapping. Decals are available on devices with Apple6 GPU family feature support.
