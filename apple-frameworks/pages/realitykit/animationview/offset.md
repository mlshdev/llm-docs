## Discussion

The default value is `0`, which indicates that the animation plays with no offset. Setting a value for this property moves the animation data along the timeline and doesn’t change timing. If you set a [fillMode](../sampledanimation/fillmode.md) other than [none](../animationfillmode/none.md), the animation fills the vacant area created by the offset according to the characteristics of the specified fill mode.
