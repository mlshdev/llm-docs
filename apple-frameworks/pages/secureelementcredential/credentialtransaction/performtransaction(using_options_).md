# performTransaction(using:options:)

**Framework:** SecureElementCredential  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 18.1+ · iPadOS 18.1+

Prompts the user for authorization and then activates a credential for card emulation.

## Declaration

```swift
func performTransaction(using credential: Credential, options: CardEmulationOptions = .init()) async throws
```

## Parameters

- `credential`: The credential to activate and transition into card emulation state.
- `options`: The options to activate the credential with, defaults to none.

## Mentioned In

- [Accessing and using secure element credentials](../accessing-and-using-secure-element-credentials.md)

## Discussion

If this call succeeds, the session state trasitions to [CredentialSession.State.cardEmulation(credential:)](../credentialsession/state-swift.enum/cardemulation%28credential_%29.md).

Card emulation ends after 60 seconds, at which point the the event stream publishes a [CredentialSession.Event.cardEmulationTimeout](../credentialsession/event/cardemulationtimeout.md) event. If you complete your transaction before the timeout, call [endCardEmulation()](../credentialsession/endcardemulation%28%29.md) to exit card emulation mode.

The caller needs to invoke [invalidate()](configuration/invalidate%28%29.md) after completing each transaction.

> **Important**

> Calling this method may generate a billable event to the credential provider.

> **Throws**

> An [CredentialSession.ErrorCode](../credentialsession/errorcode.md). The most common errors are:
>
> - [CredentialSession.ErrorCode.invalidView](../credentialsession/errorcode/invalidview.md): The transaction has no associated scene.
> - [CredentialSession.ErrorCode.userCanceledAuthorization](../credentialsession/errorcode/usercanceledauthorization.md): The user dismissed the authorization sheet.
> - [CredentialSession.ErrorCode.resourceUnavailable](../credentialsession/errorcode/resourceunavailable.md): The system resource is unavailable.
