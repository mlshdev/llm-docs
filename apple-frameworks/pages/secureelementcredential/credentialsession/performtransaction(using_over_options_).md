# performTransaction(using:over:options:)

**Framework:** SecureElementCredential  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 18.1+ · iPadOS 18.1+

Prompts the user for authorization and then activate a credential for card emulation.

## Declaration

```swift
func performTransaction(using credential: CredentialSession.Credential, over scene: UIScene, options: CredentialSession.CardEmulationOptions = .init()) async throws
```

## Parameters

- `credential`: The credential to activate and transition into card emulation state with.
- `scene`: The [UIScene](../../uikit/uiscene.md) the authentication sheet appears over.
- `options`: Options with which to transition the credential to card emulation mode.

## Discussion

1. Call [acquirePresentmentAssertion()](acquirepresentmentassertion%28%29.md) before calling this function to ensure that UI from other applications’ payment tasks don’t interfere with this transaction.
2. Relinquish the asssertion with [relinquish()](presentmentintentassertion/relinquish%28%29.md) immediately prior to calling `performTransaction(using:over:options:)`.
3. After presenting the credential, call [endCardEmulation()](endcardemulation%28%29.md) to return to management mode.
4. If you have further proprietary payment UI to perform, use [acquirePresentmentAssertion()](acquirepresentmentassertion%28%29.md) to re-acquire the assertion. Perform your tasks, then call [relinquish()](presentmentintentassertion/relinquish%28%29.md) again. Re-acquiring the assertion is subject to the limit of two assertions in an 80-second span.

The credential session state must be [CredentialSession.State.wired(credential:)](state-swift.enum/wired%28credential_%29.md) prior to calling this method. The state transitions to [CredentialSession.State.management](state-swift.enum/management.md) if the call encounters a [CredentialSession.ErrorCode.resourceUnavailable](errorcode/resourceunavailable.md) error; otherwise the state remains unchanged.

If this call succeeds the credential session state transitions to the [CredentialSession.State.cardEmulation(credential:)](state-swift.enum/cardemulation%28credential_%29.md) state.

If not ended sooner, card emulation expires after 60 seconds and the credential session publishes a [CredentialSession.Event.cardEmulationTimeout](event/cardemulationtimeout.md) event.

> **Important**

> Calling this method may generate a billable event to the credential provider.

> **Throws**

> An [CredentialSession.ErrorCode](errorcode.md). The most common errors are:
>
> - [CredentialSession.ErrorCode.userCanceledAuthorization](errorcode/usercanceledauthorization.md): The user dismissed the authorization sheet.
> - [CredentialSession.ErrorCode.resourceUnavailable](errorcode/resourceunavailable.md): The system resource is unavailable. The session transitions to [CredentialSession.State.management](state-swift.enum/management.md).
