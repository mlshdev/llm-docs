## Overview

Most of the design and layout effects in this tutorial require you to create hierarchies of nested components. In Apple News Format JSON, a container is a component that can hold other components. Container components include four types: `chapter`, `header`, `section`, and `container`.

This is an example of a simple container.

```json
{
  "role": "container",
  "components": [
    {
      "role": "title",
      "text": "A Photo",
    },
    {
      "role": "photo",
      "URL": "bundle://<filename>.<extension>",
    }
  ]
}
```

In the example above, the `container` component has two child components. Notice that a container has a property named `components` whose value is an array. Any components inside the container’s `components` array are children of the container.
