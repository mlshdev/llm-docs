## Overview

These features were added in the latest Apple News API release:

- The [Create an Article](../applenewsapi/post-channels-_channelid_-articles.md) endpoint throws a 400 error if you attempt to publish an article bundle exceeding 450 MB.
- The [Update an Article](../applenewsapi/post-articles-_articleid_.md) endpoint throws a 400 error if you attempt to update an article bundle exceeding 450 MB.

These features were added in a previous Apple News API release:

- The [Create an Article](../applenewsapi/post-channels-_channelid_-articles.md) endpoint throws a 400 error if you attempt to publish an article with a publication date before 1970, and a warning if the publication date is before 2015.
- The [Update an Article](../applenewsapi/post-articles-_articleid_.md) endpoint throws a 400 error if you attempt to update an article with a publication date before 1970, and a warning if the publication date is before 2015.

This field is no longer supported in Apple News API:

- `accessoryText` is deprecated in [Create Article Metadata Fields](../applenewsapi/create-article-metadata-fields.md) and [Update Article Metadata Fields](../applenewsapi/update-article-metadata-fields.md). Use the `authors` property in the Apple News Format [Metadata](../applenewsformat/metadata.md) object instead.
