## Overview

The fading sticky header scene causes the header to briefly “stick” to the top of the screen and then fade to a defined color.

**On this page, you’ll learn how to add a scene to your article.**

To implement a scene, you add a `scene` property to a `section` or `chapter` component.

### Apply a Scene

1. In your working `article.json` file, delete the parallax behavior from the first section. The code you are deleting begins with `"behavior": {` and ends with a closing brace and a comma (`},`).
2. Copy the example code [Scene: Copy This Code](adding-a-scene.md#Scene-Copy-This-Code).
3. Paste the code inside the first section, replacing the behavior that you deleted in step 1.

Your code should look like the example code [Scene: Result](adding-a-scene.md#Scene-Result).

After you make this change in your code, you can preview your working `article.json` file in News Preview to see the fading sticky header scene.
