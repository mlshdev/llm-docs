# Nesting Components in an Article

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** Apple News Format  
**Kind:** Article

Use container components to create the component hierarchies you need for special article designs.

## Overview

A *nested* component is a child of the parent component that contains it. The child component is positioned and rendered relative to that parent. The size of the child components determines the minimum size of a container component.

> **Tip**

>  If you use an anchor to attach multiple children to the same side of their parent component, the children “stack” to create a cleanly aligned header. For information about using container components and anchors, see [Advanced Design Tutorial 2: Layout and Positioning](apple-news-format-tutorials.md#Advanced-Design-Tutorial-2-Layout-and-Positioning).

Many design and layout effects require you to use hierarchies of nested components. For example, you can create a layering effect by nesting content (such as a `title`) inside a parent component that has a background [Fill](../applenewsformat/fill.md). Any content displayed by the parent — as well as any content from its child components — is layered in front of the parent’s background fill, as shown in this example.

Apple News Format has several container components that allow you to nest other components within them:

- [Chapter](../applenewsformat/chapter.md)
- [Header](../applenewsformat/header.md)
- [Section](../applenewsformat/section.md)
- [Container](../applenewsformat/container.md)

The [Aside](../applenewsformat/aside.md) component also lets you nest other components, but generally contains content that isn’t directly related to your article.

The following example shows a section component with two child components (`title` and `photo`) defined in its components array.

```json
{
  "role": "section",
  "components": [
  {
     "role": "title",
     "text": "A Photo",
   },
  {
     "role": "photo",
     "URL": "bundle://.",
     }
    ]
}
```

All container components have a components property whose value is an array of components. In this array, the order of the components is the order in which they appear in your article.
