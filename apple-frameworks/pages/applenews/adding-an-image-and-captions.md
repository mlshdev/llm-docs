# Adding an Image and Captions

**Interface language:** Data

**Kind:** Article

Create a photo that extends to both edges of the display, with captions that appear in the article layout and in full-screen view.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

In [Adding a Divider](adding-a-divider.md), you created a divider and used a `ComponentLayout` object to extend the divider to the right edge of the display. Here, you’ll do something similar—you’ll use a `ComponentLayout` object to position a photo against both edges of the display.

**On this page, you’ll learn how to:**

- Add a `photo` component to display an image in your article.
- Add two types of captions: one that appears in the article layout and another that appears when the image is in full screen.
- Make the photo bleed to both edges of the display by using the `ignoreDocumentMargin` property with a value of `"true"`.
- Move the photo caption closer to the content above and below it by using smaller values for the `margin` property.
- Create a new default component text style for components with the `caption` role.

### Define Positions for the Photo and Caption

In [Positioning Text Components](positioning-text-components.md), you created `ComponentLayout` objects and used them to adjust the positions of your text components. Here, you’ll do something similar, creating new `ComponentLayout` objects for photos and captions. To cause the photo to reach the far right and left edges of the display, you’ll use the `ignoreDocumentMargin` property with a value of `true`.

1. Copy the example code [fullBleedLayout and halfMarginBothLayout: Copy This Code](adding-an-image-and-captions.md#fullBleedLayout-and-halfMarginBothLayout-Copy-This-Code).
2. Paste the code inside the `ArticleDocument.componentLayouts` object in your `article.json` file, after the closing brace (`}`) of the last `ComponentLayout` object and before the closing brace for the whole `componentLayouts` property.

Your code should look like the example code [fullBleedLayout and halfMarginBothLayout: Result](adding-an-image-and-captions.md#fullBleedLayout-and-halfMarginBothLayout-Result).

      "ignoreDocumentMargin": true
    },
    "halfMarginBothLayout": {
      "columnStart": 0,
      "columnSpan": 14,
      "margin": {
        "top": 12,
        "bottom": 12
      }

      }
    }
  },
  ...
}
```

<a id="Define-a-Style-for-Caption-Text"></a>

### Define a Style for Caption Text

In [Creating Your First Article](creating-your-first-article.md), you created default text styles for component types. Here, you’ll do something similar—create a new default text style for `caption` components.

1. Copy the example code [Caption Text Style: Copy This Code](adding-an-image-and-captions.md#Caption-Text-Style-Copy-This-Code).
2. Paste the code inside the `ArticleDocument.componentTextStyles` object in your `article.json` file, after the closing brace (`}`) of the last text style and before the closing brace for the whole `componentTextStyles` property.

Your code should look like the example code [Caption Text Style: Result](adding-an-image-and-captions.md#Caption-Text-Style-Result).

#### Caption Text Style: Copy This Code

      "paragraphSpacingBefore": 12,
      "paragraphSpacingAfter": 12,
      "textColor": "#53585F"
    }
```

      "paragraphSpacingBefore": 12,
      "paragraphSpacingAfter": 12,
      "textColor": "#53585F"
    }
  }
  ...
}
```

<a id="Add-a-Photo-and-Captions-in-Your-Article"></a>

### Add a Photo and Captions in Your Article

A `photo` component in your JSON file represents a photo in your article. The `"caption"` property of the `photo` component represents some text that is seen when the image is in full screen, and a `caption` component represents some text that is visible in the article.

1. Copy the example code [Photo and Captions: Copy This Code](adding-an-image-and-captions.md#Photo-and-Captions-Copy-This-Code).
2. Paste the code inside the `components` array of your article, after the closing brace and comma (`},`) that end the `byline` component.

Your code should look like the example code [Photo and Captions: Result](adding-an-image-and-captions.md#Photo-and-Captions-Result).

After you make this change in your `article.json` file, you can preview your working `article.json` file in News Preview to see the photo and captions.

    {

      "URL": "bundle://header.jpg"
    },
    {
      "role": "caption",
      "layout": "halfMarginBothLayout",
      "text": "ABOVE: A caption for the photo. (Attribution)"
    },
    {
      "role": "divider",
      "layout": "fullMarginBelowLayout",
      "stroke": {
        "width": 1,
        "color": "#D5B327"
      }
    },
```

      }
    },

  ...
}
```

### Further Exploration

At any time, you can try changing property values in your `article.json` file and then use News Preview to see how these changes affect the look of your article.

For example, try changing the URL of your article’s `photo` component:

1. In your `article.json` file, find the `photo` component in the `components` array.
2. In the `photo` component, find the `URL` property.
3. Replace the value of the `URL` property, `"bundle://header.jpg"`, with the URL of an image on your website.
4. Preview your `article.json` file in News Preview.

The `photo` component now displays your image.
