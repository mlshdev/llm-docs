## Overview

By using the podcast component, you can add a link to a podcast without using external assets.

**On this page, you’ll learn how to**:

- Create a podcast component.
- Change the podcast orientation.

### Add a Podcast in Your Article

In [Positioning Text Components](positioning-text-components.md), you created some `ComponentLayout` objects. You’ll refer to those `ComponentLayout` objects in this code.

1. Copy the example code from [Podcast: Copy This Code](adding-a-podcast.md#Podcast-Copy-This-Code).
2. Paste the code inside the components array of your article,  after the closing brace and comma (`},`) of the body component that begins with `Consequatur` `aut doloribus`.

Your code should look like the example code in [Podcast: Result](adding-a-podcast.md#Podcast-Result).

After you make this change in your code, you can preview your working `article.json` file in News Preview to see a podcast in your article.

```json
    {
      "role": "heading2",
      "layout": "fullMarginAboveHalfBelowLayout",
      "text": "PODCAST HEADING"
    },
    {
      "role": "podcast",
      "layout": "noMarginLayout",
      "URL": "https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/apple-news-today/id1473872585"

      "URL": "https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/apple-news-today/id1473872585"
    },
    ...
  ],
  ...
}
```

### Adjust the Podcast Orientation

The podcast you added to your article shows the default podcast orientation that changes automatically based on screen size. On larger tablet screens, the podcast art displays on the left and the podcast information and link button appear on the right. On smaller mobile screens, the artwork, podcast information, and link button appear stacked.

Instead of using the orientation that automatically changes based on screen size, you can set the default orientation to `lanndscape`. The `landscape` orientation saves screen space on mobile devices.

1. Copy the line `"orientation": "landscape"`,
2. Paste the line inside your `podcast` component, after the line that begins with `"layout"`:

After you make this change in your code, you can preview your working `article.json` file in News Preview to see a podcast set to `landscape` orientation.
