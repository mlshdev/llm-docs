## Overview

A `video` component allows the user to control playback and hear audio.

**On this page, you’ll learn how to add a video component.**

### Add a Video to the Header

To add a video to your article, you simply add a `video` component to a `components` array. Here, you’ll add a `video` component to the `components` array in the `header` component.

> **Note**

>  Alternatively, to include a video that plays automatically as the header’s background, you can use a [VideoFill](../applenewsformat/videofill.md). With a video fill, playback and audio are disabled, but the video can automatically loop. With a video fill, but not a `video` component, you can also use a scene to affect how the opening section or chapter, including the video, comes into view. See [Adding a Scene](adding-a-scene.md).

In [Download the Article Bundle Examples](setting-up-the-advanced-tutorials.md#Download-the-Article-Bundle-Examples), you downloaded a bundle called `News_Design_Tutorial_Advanced_Article_3` that contains a thumbnail image. Now, you’ll move that image into your working folder and use it as a thumbnail.

1. Move the `video-still.jpg` file from the `Desktop/News_Design_Tutorial_Advanced/News_Design_Tutorial_Advanced_Article_3` folder to the folder that contains your working `article.json` file.
2. In your working `article.json` file, delete the first section, including its `components` array. The code you are deleting begins with the opening brace (`{`) before `"role": "section",` and ends with a closing bracket, a closing brace, and a comma (`]},`).
3. Copy the example code [Header Component: Copy This Code](adding-a-video.md#Header-Component-Copy-This-Code).
4. Paste the code inside the top-level `components` array, after the opening  bracket (`[`).

Your code should look like the example code [Header Component: Result](adding-a-video.md#Header-Component-Result).

After you make this change in your code, you can preview your working `article.json` file in News Preview to see the video.
