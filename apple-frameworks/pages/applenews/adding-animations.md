**Interface language:** Data

**Kind:** Article

Use animations to affect how parts of your article come into view the first time they appear.

## Overview

**On this page, you’ll learn how to apply animations to components.**

The images below display some animations. In the first image, the pull quote gets larger and darker as the user scrolls through the text. In the second image, the photo gets darker, but not larger, as the user scrolls. In the third image, the gallery moves in from the right side of the screen.

### Create Animations

1. Copy the example code [Scale Fade Animation: Copy This Code](adding-animations.md#Scale-Fade-Animation-Copy-This-Code).
2. Paste the code inside the `pullquote` component in your `article.json` file, after the closing quotation mark that ends the `text` property.
3. Copy the example code [Move-In Animation: Copy This Code](adding-animations.md#Move-In-Animation-Copy-This-Code).
4. Paste the code inside the `gallery` component in your `article.json` file, after the comma that ends the `layout` property.
5. Copy the example code [Fade-In Animation: Copy This Code](adding-animations.md#Fade-In-Animation-Copy-This-Code).
6. Paste the code inside the `photo` component in your `article.json` file, after the closing quotation mark that ends the `caption` property.

Your code should look like the example code [Animations: Result](adding-animations.md#Animations-Result).

After you make these changes in your code, you can preview your working `article.json` file in News Preview to see the animations.
