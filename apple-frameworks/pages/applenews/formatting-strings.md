## Overview

When using command-line utilities to pass a string to the API client, enclose the string in single quotation marks to treat the text literally. When you enclose a string in double quotation marks, you need to escape certain ASCII characters (for example, the $ character).

This example uses single quotation marks:

```other
alert-body='Big Company is acquiring Smaller Company for $2.5 billion.'
```

This example shows the result of using single quotation marks:

```other
"alertBody": "Big Company is acquiring Smaller Company for $2.5 billion."
```

This example uses double quotation marks incorrectly:

```other
alert-body="Big Company is acquiring Smaller Company for $2.5 billion."
```

This example shows the result of using double quotation marks incorrectly. A string in double quotation marks with the $ sign should include an escape character:

```other
"alertBody": "Big Company is acquiring Smaller Company for .5 billion."
```

This example correctly uses double quotation marks with an escape character:

```other
alert-body="Big Company is acquiring Smaller Company for \$2.5 billion."
```

This example shows the result of using double quotation marks with an escape character:

```other
"alertBody": "Big Company is acquiring Smaller Company for $2.5 billion."
```
