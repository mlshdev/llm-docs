### Add a Mosaic with Captions in Your Article

In [Download the Article Bundle Examples](setting-up-the-introductory-tutorial.md#Download-the-Article-Bundle-Examples), you downloaded a bundle called `News_Design_Tutorial_5_Galleries` that contains gallery images and mosaic images. Now, you’ll move some of those images into your working folder and create a `mosaic` component to display the images.

In [Positioning Text Components](positioning-text-components.md) and [Adding an Image and Captions](adding-an-image-and-captions.md), you created some `ComponentLayout` objects. You’ll refer to those `ComponentLayout` objects in this code.

1. Move the `mosaic-01.jpg`, `mosaic-02.jpg`, `mosaic-03.jpg`, `mosaic-04.jpg`, and `mosaic-05.jpg` files from the `Desktop/News_Design/Tutorial/News_Design_Tutorial_5_Galleries` folder that you downloaded in [Download the Article Bundle Examples](setting-up-the-introductory-tutorial.md#Download-the-Article-Bundle-Examples) to the folder that contains your working `article.json` file.
2. Copy example code [Mosaic: Copy This Code](adding-a-mosaic-of-images.md#Mosaic-Copy-This-Code).
3. Paste the code inside the `components` array of your article, after the closing brace and comma (`},`) that end the `body` component whose `text` begins with `Et harum quidem`.

Your code should look like the example code [Mosaic: Result](adding-a-mosaic-of-images.md#Mosaic-Result).

After you make this change in your code, you can preview your working `article.json` file in News Preview to see a mosaic in your article.

### Further Exploration

At any time, you can try changing property values in your `article.json` file and then use News Preview to see how these changes affect the look of your article.

For example, try changing the order of images in your `mosaic` component by changing URLs:

1. In your `article.json` file, find the `mosaic` component.
2. In the first mosaic image’s `URL` property, replace the `01` with `02`.
3. In the second mosaic image’s `URL` property, replace the `02` with `01`.
4. Preview your `article.json` file in News Preview.

The order of your first and second images has been switched.
