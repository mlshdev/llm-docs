# Adding a Pull Quote

**Interface language:** Data

**Kind:** Article

Break an existing body component into two components, and then insert a pull quote between them.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

You can use pull quotes to highlight particularly compelling and relevant points. Visually, a pull quote can break up long portions of text, providing relief to the user.

**On this page, you’ll learn how to:**

- Add a pull quote to your article.
- Use style and layout objects to customize a pull quote, including adding hanging punctuation.

> **Tip**

>  This example uses curly quotes. If you ever want to use straight quotes instead, make sure you “escape” the straight quotes using a backslash (`\`).

### Add a Pull Quote in Your Article

When a pull quote is accompanied by an attribution line, use two separate `pullquote` components. This allows you to use different layouts and different text styles for the quote text and the attribution text.

First, you’ll break an existing `body` component into two components. Then, you’ll insert two `pullquote` components (representing a pull quote and an attribution) between the `body` components.

1. In your `article.json` file, copy the `body` component whose text begins with `<p>Quis autem vel eum`, including the component’s opening brace (`{`) and closing brace and comma (`},`)
2. Paste the component after the brace and comma that end the component that you just copied, so that there are two identical `body` components.
3. In the first of the two `body` components, delete everything in the `text` property value after `blanditiis</p>`. Do not delete the closing quotation mark.
4. In the second of the two `body` components, delete everything in the `text` property value before `<p>Cras ulticies`. Do not delete the opening quotation mark.
5. Copy the example code [Pull Quote: Copy This Code](adding-a-pull-quote.md#Pull-Quote-Copy-This-Code).
6. Paste the code between the two components from steps 1 through 4, after the closing brace and comma.

Your code should look like the example code [Pull Quote: Result](adding-a-pull-quote.md#Pull-Quote-Result).

After you make these changes in your code, you can preview your working `article.json` file in News Preview to see the pull quote and attribution.

    },
    {
      "role": "pullquote",
      "text": "— ATTRIBUTION"
    },
    ...
  ],
  ...
}
```

<a id="Define-Styles-for-Pull-Quote-Text"></a>

### Define Styles for Pull Quote Text

In [Creating Your First Article](creating-your-first-article.md), you applied text styles using `ComponentTextStyle` objects. Here, you’ll do something similar—create two more `ComponentTextStyle` objects so that you can apply styles to `pullquote` components.

To set the pull quote apart visually, you’ll use `hangingPunctuation`. This causes punctuation (such as opening and closing quotation marks) to appear outside of the component’s designated span.

You can also add tracking, or the horizontal spacing between letters, to take advantage of the fact that the attribution is unlikely to use the full component width.

1. Copy the example code [Pull Quote Text Styles: Copy This Code](adding-a-pull-quote.md#Pull-Quote-Text-Styles-Copy-This-Code).
2. Paste the code between the closing brace (`}`) of the last component text style and the closing brace for the whole `componentTextStyles` property.

Your code should look like the example code [Pull Quote Text Styles: Result](adding-a-pull-quote.md#Pull-Quote-Text-Styles-Result).

      "textColor": "#A6AAA9",
      "hangingPunctuation": true
    },
    "attribution": {
      "fontName": "DINAlternate-Bold",
      "fontSize": 12,
      "lineHeight": 16,
      "tracking": 0.12,
      "textColor": "#53585F",
      "textAlignment": "right"
    }
```

    }
  }
  ...
}
```

<a id="Define-Minor-Adjustments-for-Pull-Quote-Positions"></a>

### Define Minor Adjustments for Pull Quote Positions

In [Positioning Text Components](positioning-text-components.md), you adjusted the positions of some components using `ComponentLayout` objects. Now you’ll create two other `ComponentLayout` objects to adjust the positions of your pull quote components.

1. Copy the example code [Pull Quote Layout: Copy This Code](adding-a-pull-quote.md#Pull-Quote-Layout-Copy-This-Code).
2. Paste the code between the closing brace (`}`) of the last `ComponentLayout` object and the closing brace for the whole `componentLayouts` property.

Your code should look like the example code [Pull Quote Layout: Result](adding-a-pull-quote.md#Pull-Quote-Layout-Result).

<a id="Pull-Quote-Layout-Copy-This-Code"></a>

#### Pull Quote Layout: Copy This Code

```json
,
    "fullMarginAboveLayout": {
      "columnStart": 0,
      "columnSpan": 14,
      "margin": {
        "top": 24
      }
    },
    "halfMarginAboveQuarterBelowLayout": {
      "columnStart": 0,
      "columnSpan": 14,
      "margin": {
        "top": 12,
        "bottom": 6
      }
    }
```

  ...
  "componentLayouts": {
    ...
    "fullMarginAboveLayout": {
      "columnStart": 0,
      "columnSpan": 7,
      "margin": {
        "top": 24
      }
    },
    "halfMarginAboveQuarterBelowLayout": {
      "columnStart": 0,
      "columnSpan": 7,
      "margin": {
        "top": 12,
        "bottom": 6
      }
    }
  },
...
}
```

<a id="Use-Style-and-Layout-Objects-and-Add-Dividers"></a>

### Use Style and Layout Objects and Add Dividers

Now that you have defined `ComponentLayout` objects, you can use them in the `pullquote` components.

1. Copy the example code [Divider Above Pull Quote: Copy This Code](adding-a-pull-quote.md#Divider-Above-Pull-Quote-Copy-This-Code).
2. Paste the code before the opening brace (`{`) that begins the first `pullquote` component.
3. Copy the example code [Divider Below Pull Quote: Copy This Code](adding-a-pull-quote.md#Divider-Below-Pull-Quote-Copy-This-Code).
4. Paste the code after the closing brace and comma (`},`) that end the second `pullquote` component.
5. Copy the line `"layout": "halfMarginAboveQuarterBelowLayout",`
6. Paste the line after the first instance of `"role": "pullquote",`
7. Copy the line `"layout": "halfMarginBelowLayout",`
8. Paste the line after the second instance of `"role": "pullquote",`
9. Copy the line `"textStyle": "attribution",`
10. Paste the line that you copied after the line `"layout": "halfMarginBelowLayout",`

Your code should look like the example code [Pull Quote Styles and Layout: Result](adding-a-pull-quote.md#Pull-Quote-Styles-and-Layout-Result).

After you make these changes in your code, you can preview your working `article.json` file in News Preview to see the changes to styles and layout. For example, the vertical positioning of the pull quote components has changed, and the attribution uses a different color. You can also see the new dividers.

#### Divider Above Pull Quote: Copy This Code

```json
    {
      "role": "divider",
      "layout": "fullMarginAboveLayout",
      "stroke": {
        "width": 1,
        "color": "#D5B327"
      }
    },
```

    {
      "role": "divider",
      "layout": "fullMarginBelowLayout",

        "width": 1,
        "color": "#D5B327"
      }
    },
