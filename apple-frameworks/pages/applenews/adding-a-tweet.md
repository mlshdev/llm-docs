## Overview

A `tweet` component lets users see social media content in an article.

**On this page, you’ll learn how to use a tweet component to embed a tweet in an article.**

### Add a Tweet in Your Article

In [Positioning Text Components](positioning-text-components.md), you created some `ComponentLayout` objects. You’ll refer to those `ComponentLayout` objects in this code.

1. Copy the example code [Tweet: Copy This Code](adding-a-tweet.md#Tweet-Copy-This-Code).
2. Paste the code inside in the `components` array of your article, after the last component and before the closing square bracket (`]`) at the end of the array.

Your code should look like the example code [Tweet: Result](adding-a-tweet.md#Tweet-Result).

After you make this change in your code, you can preview your working `article.json` file in News Preview to see a tweet in your article.

#### Tweet: Copy This Code

```json
,
    {
      "role": "heading2",
      "layout": "fullMarginAboveHalfBelowLayout",
      "text": "TWEET HEADING"
    },
    {
      "role": "tweet",
      "layout": "noMarginLayout",
      "URL": "https://twitter.com/Urna_Semper/status/1480968065630285834"
    }
```

<a id="Tweet-Result"></a>

#### Tweet: Result

Ellipses (`...`) indicate lines of code that have been omitted from this example.

```json
{
  ...
  "components": [
    ...
    {
      "role": "heading2",
      "layout": "fullMarginAboveHalfBelowLayout",
      "text": "TWEET HEADING"
    },
    {
      "role": "tweet",
      "layout": "noMarginLayout",
      "URL": "https://twitter.com/Urna_Semper/status/1480968065630285834"
    }
  ],
  ...
}
```

### Further Exploration

At any time, you can try changing property values in your `article.json` file and then use News Preview to see how these changes affect the look of your article.

For example, try changing which tweet appears in your article:

1. In your `article.json` file, find the `tweet` component.
2. Replace the value of the component’s `URL` property (`"https://twitter.com/Urna_Semper/status/1480968065630285834"`) with the URL to another tweet.
3. Preview your `article.json` file in News Preview.

The article now shows the tweet that you chose.
