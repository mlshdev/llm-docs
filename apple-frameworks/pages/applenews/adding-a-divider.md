<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

In [Creating Your First Article](creating-your-first-article.md), you added some text components to your article. Now, you can add a `divider` component to visually separate some text components and create color contrast.

**On this page, you’ll learn how to create a horizontal dividing line that extends to the right edge of the display.**

### Define a ComponentLayout Object that Bleeds to the Right Edge

Before you can make your divider line extend to the right edge of the display, you must define a new `ComponentLayout` object that uses the `ignoreDocumentMargin` property.

1. Copy the example code [bigDividerLayout: Copy This Code](adding-a-divider.md#bigDividerLayout-Copy-This-Code).
2. Paste the code inside your `ArticleDocument.componentLayouts` object, after the closing brace (`}`) of the last `ComponentLayout` object and before the closing brace for the whole `componentLayouts` property.

Your code should look like the example code [bigDividerLayout: Result](adding-a-divider.md#bigDividerLayout-Result).

<a id="bigDividerLayout-Copy-This-Code"></a>

#### bigDividerLayout: Copy This Code

```json
,
    "bigDividerLayout": {
      "ignoreDocumentMargin": "right",
      "columnStart": 0,
      "columnSpan": 20,
      "margin": {
        "top": 6,
        "bottom": 6
      }
    }
```

<a id="bigDividerLayout-Result"></a>

#### bigDividerLayout: Result

Ellipses (`...`) indicate lines of code that have been omitted from this example.

```json
{
  ...
  "componentLayouts": {
    ...
    "bigDividerLayout": {
      "ignoreDocumentMargin": "right",
      "columnStart": 0,
      "columnSpan": 20,
      "margin": {
        "top": 6,
        "bottom": 6
      }
    }
  },
  ...
}
```

<a id="Add-a-Divider-in-Your-Article"></a>

### Add a Divider in Your Article

A `divider` component in your JSON file represents a divider line in your article.

1. Copy the example code [Divider: Copy This Code](adding-a-divider.md#Divider-Copy-This-Code).
2. Paste the code inside the `components` array of your article, after the closing brace and comma (`},`) that end `heading1` component.

Your code should look like the example code [Divider: Result](adding-a-divider.md#Divider-Result).

After you make this change in your code, you can preview your working `article.json` file in News Preview to see a yellow divider.

#### Divider: Copy This Code

```json
    {
      "role": "divider",
      "layout": "bigDividerLayout",
      "stroke": {
        "width": 3,
        "color": "#D5B327"
      }
    },
```

<a id="Divider-Result"></a>

#### Divider: Result

Ellipses (…) indicate lines of code that have been omitted from this example.

```json
{
  ...
  "components": [
    ...
    {
      "role": "divider",
      "layout": "bigDividerLayout",
      "stroke": {
        "width": 3,
        "color": "#D5B327"
      }
    },
    ...
  ],
  ...
}
```

### Further Exploration

At any time, you can try changing property values in your `article.json` file and then use News Preview to see how these changes affect the look of your article.

For example, try changing the layout of your article’s `divider` component:

1. In your `article.json` file, find the `ComponentLayout` object called `bigDividerLayout`.
2. In `bigDividerLayout`, find the `ignoreDocumentMargin` property and replace its value (`"right"`) with `"both"`.
3. Preview your `article.json` file in News Preview.

The divider now ignores the margins on both sides of the document.
