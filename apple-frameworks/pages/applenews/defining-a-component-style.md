## Overview

You can use component styles to add interest and variety to your article and to make some content easier to read. Component styles include:

- Background color. Set a background color for the component.
- Corner radius. Apply rounded corners to a component by using the `mask` property in [ComponentStyle](../applenewsformat/componentstyle.md).
- Fill. Use an image or video for a component background, or set a gradient fill that transitions from one color to another.
- Opacity. Set the opacity for a component from completely opaque to completely transparent.
- Border. Set the border color, width, and style for a component or for a table cell.
- Table style. Specify the styling (color, stroke style, text style, and so on) that you want for the rows, columns, and cells of a data or HTML table.

### Define a Style

To use a component style once, simply include a [ComponentStyle](../applenewsformat/componentstyle.md) object as the value of the individual component’s style property.

To define a style for multiple components:

1. In the [ArticleDocument.componentStyles](../applenewsformat/articledocument/componentstyles-data.dictionary.md) object, include a property with a name that you define and a `ComponentStyle` object value.
2. Use the name you defined as the value of the individual componentʼs style property.

For more about properties and objects, see [JSON Concepts and Article Structure](json-concepts-and-article-structure.md).
