# IOUserSCSIPeripheralDeviceType07

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** SCSIPeripheralsDriverKit  
**Kind:** Class  
**Availability:** DriverKit 22.0+

A DriverKit provider object that works with Type07 devices, those that use extended SCSI Block Commands (SBC) for optical memory devices.

## Declaration

```objectivec
class IOUserSCSIPeripheralDeviceType07;
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Subclass this class to create a driver for optical memory devices, such as erasable or rewritable optical disk drives. In your subclass, override all pure virtual methods.

Use the functions in [SCSI commands](scsi-commands.md) to populate Command Descriptor Blocks (CDBs) that you send to the device with [UserSendCDB](iouserscsiperipheraldevicetype07/usersendcdb.md).

## Topics

### Managing the device

- [UserDetermineDeviceCharacteristics](iouserscsiperipheraldevicetype07/userdeterminedevicecharacteristics.md): Performs enumeration-time initializations in response to a call from the framework.
- [UserResetDevice](iouserscsiperipheraldevicetype07/userresetdevice.md): Performs a bus reset of the external drive.

### Sending commands to the device

- [UserSendCDB](iouserscsiperipheraldevicetype07/usersendcdb.md): Sends a vendor-specific Command Descriptor Block (CDB) to the device.
- [SCSIType07OutParameters](scsitype07outparameters.md): Parameters for commands to send to the external SCSI device.
- [SCSIType07OutVersion](scsitype07outversion.md): Constants that represent versions of the Type05 outbound interface.
- [SCSIType07InParameters](scsitype07inparameters.md): Parameters for responses from the external SCSI device.
- [SCSIType07InVersion](scsitype07inversion.md): Constants that represent versions of the Type07 inbound interface.

### Providing device metadata

- [UserReportMediumBlockSize](iouserscsiperipheraldevicetype07/userreportmediumblocksize.md): Provides a report on the external device’s block size.

### Suspending and resuming services

- [UserSuspendServices](iouserscsiperipheraldevicetype07/usersuspendservices.md): Suspends services and allows the dext to communicate with the external drive.
- [UserResumeServices](iouserscsiperipheraldevicetype07/userresumeservices.md): Resumes normal services after a suspension.
