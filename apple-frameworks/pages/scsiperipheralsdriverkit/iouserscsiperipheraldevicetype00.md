# IOUserSCSIPeripheralDeviceType00

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** SCSIPeripheralsDriverKit  
**Kind:** Class  
**Availability:** DriverKit 22.0+

A DriverKit provider object that works with type 00 devices, those that use SCSI Block Commands (SBC).

## Declaration

```objectivec
class IOUserSCSIPeripheralDeviceType00;
```

## Overview

Subclass this class to create a driver for direct-access block devices, such as magnetic disks and solid-state drives. In your subclass, override all pure virtual methods.

Use the functions in [SCSI commands](scsi-commands.md) to populate Command Descriptor Blocks (CDBs) that you send to the device with [UserSendCDB](iouserscsiperipheraldevicetype00/usersendcdb.md).

## Topics

### Managing the device

- [UserDetermineDeviceCharacteristics](iouserscsiperipheraldevicetype00/userdeterminedevicecharacteristics.md): Performs enumeration-time initializations in response to a call from the framework.
- [UserResetDevice](iouserscsiperipheraldevicetype00/userresetdevice.md): Performs a bus reset of the external drive.

### Sending commands to the device

- [UserSendCDB](iouserscsiperipheraldevicetype00/usersendcdb.md): Sends a vendor-specific Command Descriptor Block (CDB) to the device.
- [SCSIType00OutParameters](scsitype00outparameters.md): Parameters for commands to send to the external SCSI device.
- [SCSIType00OutVersion](scsitype00outversion.md): Constants that represent versions of the type 00 outbound interface.
- [SCSIType00InParameters](scsitype00inparameters.md): Parameters for responses from the external SCSI device.
- [SCSIType00InVersion](scsitype00inversion.md): Constants that represent versions of the type 00 inbound interface.

### Suspending and resuming services

- [UserSuspendServices](iouserscsiperipheraldevicetype00/usersuspendservices.md): Suspends services and allows the dext to communicate with the external drive.
- [UserResumeServices](iouserscsiperipheraldevicetype00/userresumeservices.md): Resumes normal services after a suspension.

### Providing device metadata

- [UserReportMediumBlockSize](iouserscsiperipheraldevicetype00/userreportmediumblocksize.md): Provides a report on the external device’s block size.

## Relationships
