# IOUserSCSIPeripheralDeviceType05

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** SCSIPeripheralsDriverKit  
**Kind:** Class  
**Availability:** DriverKit 22.0+

A DriverKit provider object that works with type 05 devices, those that use SCSI Multimedia Commands (SMC).

## Declaration

```objectivec
class IOUserSCSIPeripheralDeviceType05;
```

## Overview

Subclass this class to create a driver for multimedia devices, such as CD-ROM and DVD-ROM peripherals. In your subclass, override all pure virtual methods.

Use the functions in [SCSI commands](scsi-commands.md) to populate Command Descriptor Blocks (CDBs) that you send to the device with [UserSendCDB](iouserscsiperipheraldevicetype05/usersendcdb.md).

## Topics

### Managing the device

- [UserInitializeDeviceSupport](iouserscsiperipheraldevicetype05/userinitializedevicesupport.md): Performs enumeration-time initializations in response to a call from the framework.
- [UserResetDevice](iouserscsiperipheraldevicetype05/userresetdevice.md): Performs a bus reset of the external drive.

### Sending commands to the device

- [UserSendCDB](iouserscsiperipheraldevicetype05/usersendcdb.md): Sends a vendor-specific Command Descriptor Block (CDB) to the device.
- [SCSIType05OutParameters](scsitype05outparameters.md): Parameters for commands to send to the external SCSI device.
- [SCSIType05OutVersion](scsitype05outversion.md): Constants that represent versions of the type 05 outbound interface.
- [SCSIType05InParameters](scsitype05inparameters.md): Parameters for responses from the external SCSI device.
- [SCSIType05InVersion](scsitype05inversion.md): Constants that represent versions of the type 05 inbound interface.

### Suspending and resuming services

- [UserSuspendServices](iouserscsiperipheraldevicetype05/usersuspendservices.md): Suspends services and allows the dext to communicate with the external drive.
- [UserResumeServices](iouserscsiperipheraldevicetype05/userresumeservices.md): Resumes normal services after a suspension.

### Providing device metadata

- [UserReportMediumBlockSize](iouserscsiperipheraldevicetype05/userreportmediumblocksize.md): Provides a report on the external device’s block size.
