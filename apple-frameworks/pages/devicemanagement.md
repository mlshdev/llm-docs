## Overview

Deploying a device management service allows administrators to securely and remotely configure enrolled devices. Administrators use Apple School Manager or Apple Business Manager to enroll organization-owned devices, and users can enroll their own devices. After enrolling a device, administrators can update software and device settings; monitor compliance with organizational policies; remotely erase or lock devices; and install apps, books, and subscriptions developed in-house or purchased through Apple School Manager or Apple Business Manager.

A device management service uses the Mobile Device Management (MDM) protocol to establish a communication channel with devices and declarative configurations, as well as configuration profiles to deploy settings.

Device management works with Managed App Distribution and Managed App Configuration to provide a seamless app download and launch experience. For more information, see [ManagedAppDistribution](managedappdistribution.md) and [ManagedApp](managedapp.md).
