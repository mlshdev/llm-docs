# vDSP (Swift)

**Framework:** Accelerate  
**Kind:** API Collection

Perform basic arithmetic operations and common digital signal processing (DSP) routines on large vectors.

## Overview

The vDSP library contains a collection of highly optimized functions for DSP, type conversion, and general purpose arithmetic on large collections. The library includes DSP operations such as convolution and correlation, Fourier transformation, and biquadratic filtering. For arithmetic on large collections, vDSP includes functions such as multiply-add and reduction functions including sum, mean, and maximum.

The following sequence of images illustrates an example of the vDSP library’s capabilities. The [vDSP_vtmerg](vdsp_vtmerg.md) function combines two waveforms to produce a vector to create a smooth transition between two signals.

The bottom row shows the merged result. The resulting signal starts with a low-frequency wave and gradually transforms to a high-frequency wave.](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.accelerate/media-4310314@2x.png)
