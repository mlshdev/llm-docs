# vDSP_wienerD

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** Accelerate  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** iOS 4.0+ · iPadOS 4.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.4+ · tvOS · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

Solves a system of linear equations for a double-precision symmetric Toeplitz coefficient matrix.

## Declaration

```objectivec
extern void vDSP_wienerD(vDSP_Length __L, const double *__A, const double *__C, double *__F, double *__P, int __Flag, int *__Error);
```

## Parameters

- `__L`: The number of elements in the output vector.
- `__A`: The diagonal values of the coefficient matrix. If you’re using this function to generate a Wiener filter, pass the autocorrelation of a given signal.
- `__C`: The values of the RHS vector. If you’re using this function to generate a Wiener filter, pass the cross-correlation of signal and observation.
- `__F`: The output vector.
- `__P`: The performance index that’s a measure of the error for each component of the signal.
- `__Flag`: Not currently used, pass zero.
- `__Error`: The error flag. In the case of an error, the function populates the error flag with the pass in which the failure occurred.

## Discussion

Use this function to solve a system of simultaneous equations where the coefficient matrix is a symmetric Toeplitz matrix. A symmetric matrix is one that’s equal to its transpose, that is, a matrix that’s identical when swapping its row and column indices. A Toeplitz matrix is a matrix where each diagonal is constant.

The example below shows a matrix equation where the coefficient matrix is a symmetric Toeplitz matrix:

![A mathematical formula that describes a matrix equation. A four-by-four matrix is multiplied by the four-element vector, f, equals a four-element matrix. The vector f contains unknown values.](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.accelerate/media-3855534@2x.png)

This function solves the equation and finds the values for the output vector, `__F`.

Because the 4 x 4 coefficient matrix is symmetric, it contains four diagonal bands that you define using a four-element vector. The following code shows how to solve a system of linear equations using [vDSP_wiener](vdsp_wiener.md):

```swift
// The `coefficientMatrix` array contains the diagonal values of
// the symmetric Toeplitz coefficient matrix `a` in `a · f = c`.
let coefficientMatrix: [Double] = [15, 60, 3, 9]

// The `constants` array contains the RHS `c` in `a · f = c`.
let constants: [Double] = [360, 564, 816, 510]

var performanceIndex = [Double](repeating: 0,
                                count: constants.count)
var error = Int32(0)

// On return, `result` contains the solution `f` in `a · f = c`.
let result = [Double](unsafeUninitializedCapacity: constants.count) {
    buffer, count in
    
    vDSP_wienerD(vDSP_Length(constants.count),
                coefficientMatrix,
                constants,
                buffer.baseAddress!,
                &performanceIndex, 0,
                &error)
    
    count = constants.count
}

guard error == 0 else {
    fatalError("Solve failed at pass \(error).")
}

// Prints `[1.9999999999999964, 3.9999999999999885,
//          6.0000000000000036, 8.000000000000002] ≈ [2, 4, 6, 8]`
print(result)
```

Note that this function only works out-of-place.

Typical methods for solving *N* equations in *N* unknowns have execution times proportional to \_N_3, and memory requirements proportional to \_N_2. By taking advantage of duplicate elements, the recursion method implemented by [vDSP_wiener](vdsp_wiener.md) executes in a time proportional to \_N_2 and requires memory proportional to *N*. The Wiener-Levinson algorithm recursively builds a solution by computing the *m+1* matrix solution from the *m* matrix solution.

You can use the solution, *F*, as a Wiener filter.
