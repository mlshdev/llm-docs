# DenseVector_Float (Swift)

**Framework:** Accelerate  
**Kind:** Structure  
**Availability:** iOS · iPadOS · Mac Catalyst · macOS · tvOS · visionOS · watchOS

A structure that contains a dense vector of single-precision, floating-point values.

## Declaration

```swift
struct DenseVector_Float
```

## Overview

You typically use dense vectors to represent the unknowns vector, *x*, and the right-hand-side vector, *b*, in the matrix equation *Ax = b.* A [DenseVector_Float](densevector_float.md) structure provides a pointer to its underlying data and a count of its number of elements.

The following code shows an example of how to create a dense vector structure from an array of single-precision values. In this case, use [withUnsafeMutableBufferPointer(\_:)](acceleratemutablebuffer/withunsafemutablebufferpointer%28__%29.md) to pass a pointer to your collection. The [DenseVector_Float](densevector_float.md) structure is valid only during the execution of the closure. Don’t store or return the structure for later use.

```swift
var vectorValues: [Float] = [10, 20, 30, 40]
let vectorValuesCount = Int32(vectorValues.count)

vectorValues.withUnsafeMutableBufferPointer { vectorValuesPtr in
    
    let vector = DenseVector_Float(count: vectorValuesCount,
                                   data: vectorValuesPtr.baseAddress!)
    
    // Perform operations using `vector`.
}
```
