# addSubtract(\_:\_:addResult:subtractResult:)

**Framework:** Accelerate  
**Kind:** Type Method  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 13.0+ · visionOS · watchOS 6.0+

Calculates the double-precision element-wise sum and subtraction of two vectors.

## Declaration

```swift
static func addSubtract<S, T, U, V>(_ vectorA: S, _ vectorB: T, addResult: inout U, subtractResult: inout V) where S : AccelerateBuffer, T : AccelerateBuffer, U : AccelerateMutableBuffer, V : AccelerateMutableBuffer, S.Element == Double, T.Element == Double, U.Element == Double, V.Element == Double
```

## Parameters

- `vectorA`: The first input vector, `A`.
- `vectorB`: The second input vector, `B`.
- `addResult`: The addition output vector, `O0`.
- `subtractResult`: The subtraction output vector, `O1`.

## Discussion

This function calculates the addition and subtraction of the first `N` elements of input vectors `A` and `B`, and writes the result to output vector `C`.

```swift
 for (i = 0; i < N; ++i)
 {
     i1 = I1[i*I1S];
     i0 = I0[i*I0S];
     O0[i*O0S] = i0 + i1;
     O1[i*O1S] = i0 - i1;
 }

```

The following code shows an example of using this function:

```swift
    let count = 5
    
    let a: [Double] = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
    let b: [Double] = [ 1,  2,  3,  4,  5]
    
    var o0 = [Double](repeating: 0, count: count)
    var o1 = [Double](repeating: 0, count: count)
    
    vDSP.addSubtract(a, b, addResult: &o0, subtractResult: &o1)
    
    // Prints the addition result: "[11.0, 22.0, 33.0, 44.0, 55.0]".
    print(o0)
    
    // Prints the subtraction result: "[9.0, 18.0, 27.0, 36.0, 45.0]".
    print(o1)
```
