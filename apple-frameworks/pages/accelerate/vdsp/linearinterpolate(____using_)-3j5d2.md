# linearInterpolate(\_:\_:using:)

**Framework:** Accelerate  
**Kind:** Type Method  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 13.0+ · visionOS · watchOS 6.0+

Returns the linear interpolation between the supplied double-precision vectors.

## Declaration

```swift
static func linearInterpolate<T, U>(_ vectorA: T, _ vectorB: U, using interpolationConstant: Double) -> [Double] where T : AccelerateBuffer, U : AccelerateBuffer, T.Element == Double, U.Element == Double
```

## Discussion

Single-precision and double-precision [linearInterpolate(\_:\_:using:)](linearinterpolate%28____using_%29-3j5d2.md) functions return a vector that’s the element-wise linear interpolation between the two supplied vectors.

For example, the following code creates two arrays, vectorA and vectorB, that contain sine waves:

```swift
let n = 1024

let vectorA: [Float] = (0 ... n).map {
    return 2 + sin(Float($0) * 0.07)
}

let vectorB: [Float] = (0 ... n).map {
    return -2 + sin(Float($0) * 0.03)
}
```

Use [linearInterpolate(\_:\_:using:)](linearinterpolate%28____using_%29-71as1.md) with an interpolation constant of 0.5 to generate a new vector that’s the average of the two sine waves:

```swift
let result = vDSP.linearInterpolate(vectorA, vectorB,
                                    using: 0.5)
```

The following figure visualizes the two source vectors: the blue lines at the top and bottom, and the interpolation result: the red line in the center:
