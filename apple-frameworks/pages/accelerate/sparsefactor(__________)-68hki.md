# SparseFactor(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Accelerate  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** iOS 11.0+ · iPadOS 11.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.13+ · tvOS 11.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 4.0+

Returns the factorization of a sparse matrix of double-precision values that corresponds to the supplied symbolic factorization using user-defined workspace and factor storage.

## Declaration

```swift
func SparseFactor(_ symbolicFactor: SparseOpaqueSymbolicFactorization, _ Matrix: SparseMatrix_Double, _ nfoptions: SparseNumericFactorOptions, _ factorStorage: UnsafeMutableRawPointer?, _ workspace: UnsafeMutableRawPointer?) -> SparseOpaqueFactorization_Double
```

## Parameters

- `symbolicFactor`: A symbolic factorization that returns by calling [SparseFactor(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:)](sparsefactor%28__________%29-68hki.md).
- `Matrix`: The matrix to factorize.
- `nfoptions`: The numeric factor options, such as pivoting parameters.
- `factorStorage`: A pointer to space for storing the factorization of size at least [factorSize_Double](sparseopaquesymbolicfactorization/factorsize_double.md) bytes. Don’t alter this storage during the lifetime of the return value.
- `workspace`: A pointer to a workspace of size at least [workspaceSize_Double](sparseopaquesymbolicfactorization/workspacesize_double.md) bytes. You can reuse or deallocate the workspace storage after the function returns.

## Discussion

Use this function to solve a system of linear equations using a symbolic factorization that [SparseFactor(\_:\_:)](sparsefactor%28____%29-3697o.md) creates.

![A mathematical equation that has one set of three simultaneous equations on the left. Each equation has three unknowns. The same set of simultaneous equations appears on the right as a single matrix equation, A x equals B. The single matrix equation consists of a three-by-three matrix multiplied by a three-element column matrix that equals a three-element column matrix.](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.accelerate/media-3703945@2x.png)

The following code creates the workspace and factor storage that this function requires, and solves this system with a QR factorization of the coefficient matrix:

```swift
/// Define the sparsity pattern of the coefficient matrix.
let rowIndices: [Int32] =    [ 0, 1, 1, 2]
let columnIndices: [Int32] = [ 2, 0, 2, 1]

/// Create the double-precision coefficient matrix _A_.
let aValues: [Double] = [10, 20, 5, 50]
let A = SparseConvertFromCoordinate(3, 3,
                                    4, 1,
                                    SparseAttributes_t(),
                                    rowIndices, columnIndices,
                                    aValues)

/// Compute the symbolic factorization from the structure of the coefficient matrix.
let structure = A.structure
let symbolicFactorization = SparseFactor(SparseFactorizationQR,
                                         structure)

/// Create the workspace.
let workspace = UnsafeMutableRawPointer.allocate(
    byteCount: symbolicFactorization.workspaceSize_Double,
    alignment: MemoryLayout<Double>.alignment)
defer {
    workspace.deallocate()
}

/// Create the factor storage.
let factorStorage = UnsafeMutableRawPointer.allocate(
    byteCount: symbolicFactorization.factorSize_Double,
    alignment: MemoryLayout<Double>.alignment)
defer {
    factorStorage.deallocate()
}

/// Factorize _A_ using the symbolic factorization.
let factorization = SparseFactor(symbolicFactorization, A,
                                 SparseNumericFactorOptions(),
                                 factorStorage, workspace)

/// Solve _Ax = b_ in place.
var b0Values: [Double] = [30, 35, 100]
b0Values.withUnsafeMutableBufferPointer { bPtr in
    let xb = DenseVector_Double(count: 3,
                                data: bPtr.baseAddress!)
    
    SparseSolve(factorization, xb)
}

SparseCleanup(A)
SparseCleanup(factorization)
```

On return, `bValues` contains the values `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0].`

Note that internal memory allocations may occur in the case of pivoted factorizations that result in delayed pivots. If you require closer control over memory allocations, supply a [malloc](sparsesymbolicfactoroptions/malloc.md) function that implements the required behavior, or use an alternative that nonpivoted factorization returns. Note that if [malloc](sparsesymbolicfactoroptions/malloc.md) returns `NULL`, the factorization aborts immediately.
