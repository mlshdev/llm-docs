# cblas_dsyrk(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Accelerate  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** iOS 16.4+ · iPadOS 16.4+ · Mac Catalyst 16.4+ · macOS 13.3+ · tvOS 16.4+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 9.4+

Rank-k update—multiplies a symmetric matrix by its transpose and adds a second matrix (double precision).

## Declaration

```swift
func cblas_dsyrk(_ ORDER: CBLAS_ORDER, _ UPLO: CBLAS_UPLO, _ TRANS: CBLAS_TRANSPOSE, _ N: __LAPACK_int, _ K: __LAPACK_int, _ ALPHA: Double, _ A: UnsafePointer<Double>?, _ LDA: __LAPACK_int, _ BETA: Double, _ C: UnsafeMutablePointer<Double>?, _ LDC: __LAPACK_int)
```

## Parameters

- `ORDER`: Specifies row-major (C) or column-major (Fortran) data ordering.
- `UPLO`: Specifies whether to use the upper or lower triangle from the matrix. Valid values are `'U'` or `'L'`.
- `TRANS`: Specifies whether to use matrix A (`'N'` or `'n'`) or the transpose of A (`'T'`, `'t'`, `'C'`, or `'c'`).
- `N`: Order of matrix `C`.
- `K`: Number of columns in matrix `A` (or number of rows if matrix `A` is transposed).
- `ALPHA`: Scaling factor for matrix `A`.
- `A`: Matrix `A`.
- `LDA`: Leading dimension of array containing matrix `A`.
- `BETA`: Scaling factor for matrix `C`.
- `C`: Matrix `C`.
- `LDC`: Leading dimension of array containing matrix `C`.

## Discussion

Calculates `alpha*A*A`; if transposed, calculates `alpha*A`.

> **Important**

>  Apple provides the BLAS and LAPACK libraries under the Accelerate framework to be in line with LAPACK 3.9.1. Starting with iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, tvOS 26, visionOS 26, and watchOS 26, the libraries are in line with LAPACK 3.12.0. These new interfaces provide additional functionality, as well as a new ILP64 interface. To use the new interfaces, define `ACCELERATE_NEW_LAPACK` before including the Accelerate or vecLib headers. For ILP64 interfaces, also define `ACCELERATE_LAPACK_ILP64`. For Swift projects, specify `ACCELERATE_NEW_LAPACK=1` and `ACCELERATE_LAPACK_ILP64=1` as preprocessor macros in Xcode build settings under Apple Clang - Preprocessing \> Preprocessor Macros.
