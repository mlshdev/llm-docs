## Overview

simd provides types and functions for small vector and matrix computations. The types include integer and floating-point vectors and matrices, and the functions provide basic arithmetic operations, element-wise mathematical operations, and geometric and linear algebra operations.

simd supports vectors containing up to 16 elements (for single-precision values) or 8 elements (for double-precision values), and matrices up to 4 x 4 elements in size. Other frameworks, such as [vForce](vforce-library.md), allow you to work with larger vectors.
