# Single-channel biquadratic filters (Swift)

**Framework:** Accelerate  
**Kind:** API Collection

Filter a single-channel signal with a cascade of biquadratic sections.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

The vDSP library implements biquadratic filtering as a cascade of individual infinite impulse response (IIR) filters called *sections.* Each section has its own set of feedback and feedforward coefficients, and implements a direct-form 1 filter.

When the biquadratic filter function executes, the sections execute in sequence. Each section processes the entire input signal and passes its output to the next section for further processing.

> **Note**

>  The vDSP biquadratic filters work in place. That is, the source and destination pointers may point to the same memory.
