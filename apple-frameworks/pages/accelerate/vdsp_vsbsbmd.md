# vDSP_vsbsbmD

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** Accelerate  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** iOS 4.0+ · iPadOS 4.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.4+ · tvOS · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

Calculates the double-precision element-wise product of the differences of two pairs of vectors, using the specified stride.

## Declaration

```objectivec
extern void vDSP_vsbsbmD(const double *__A, vDSP_Stride __IA, const double *__B, vDSP_Stride __IB, const double *__C, vDSP_Stride __IC, const double *__D, vDSP_Stride __ID, double *__E, vDSP_Stride __IE, vDSP_Length __N);
```

## Parameters

- `__A`: The input vector `A` in `E = (B - A) * (D - C)`.
- `__IA`: The distance between the elements in the input vector `A`.
- `__B`: The input vector `B` in `E = (B - A) * (D - C)`.
- `__IB`: The distance between the elements in the input vector `B`.
- `__C`: The input vector `C` in `E = (B - A) * (D - C)`.
- `__IC`: The distance between the elements in the input vector `C`.
- `__D`: The input vector `D` in `E = (B - A) * (D - C)`.
- `__ID`: The distance between the elements in the input vector `D`.
- `__E`: The output vector `E` in `E = (B - A) * (D - C)`.
- `__IE`: The distance between the elements in the output vector `E`.
- `__N`: The number of elements that the function processes.

## Discussion

This function calculates the products of the first `N` elements of the subtraction of vectors `A` and `B` and the subtraction of vectors `C` and `D`.

```swift
 for (n = 0; n < N; ++n)
    E[n] = (B[n]-A[n]) * (D[n]-C[n]); 
```

The second row represents the operations that subtract vectors A and B, and subtract vectors C and D, with three boxes of each. The third row represents the multiplication operation as three boxes.  The bottom row represents the output vector E as three boxes. The diagram has connecting lines from the input vectors to the operations, and from the operations to the output vectors.  ](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.accelerate/media-4337093@2x.png)

The following code shows an example of using this function:

```swift
    let stride = 1
    let count = 5
    
    let b: [Double] = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
    let a: [Double] = [ 1,  2,  3,  4,  5]
    let d: [Double] = [50, 40, 30, 20, 10]
    let c: [Double] = [ 5,  4,  3,  2,  1]
    
    
    let e = [Double](unsafeUninitializedCapacity: count) {
        buffer, initializedCount in
        
        vDSP_vsbsbmD(a, stride,
                     b, stride,
                     c, stride,
                     d, stride,
                     buffer.baseAddress!, stride,
                     vDSP_Length(count))
        
        initializedCount = count
    }
    
    // Prints "[605.0, 968.0, 1089.0, 968.0, 605.0]".
    print(e)

```
