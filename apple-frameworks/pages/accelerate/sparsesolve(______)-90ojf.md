# SparseSolve(\_:\_:\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Accelerate  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** iOS 18.5+ · iPadOS 18.5+ · Mac Catalyst 18.5+ · macOS 15.5+ · tvOS 18.5+ · visionOS 2.5+ · watchOS 11.5+

Solve the equation `Subfactor * x = b` for the vector `x` of complex double values, in place.

## Declaration

```swift
func SparseSolve(_ Subfactor: SparseOpaqueSubfactor_Complex_Double, _ XB: DenseVector_Complex_Double, _ workspace: UnsafeMutableRawPointer)
```

## Parameters

- `Subfactor`: (Input) The subfactor to solve a system involving, as returned by `SparseCreateSubfactor()`.
- `workspace`: (Scratch) A workspace of size `Subfactor.workspaceRequiredStatic + 1*Subfactor.workspaceRequiredPerRHS * 2`. This memory must be 16-byte aligned (any allocation returned by `malloc()` has this property).

# SparseSolve (Objective-C)

**Framework:** Accelerate  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** iOS 18.5+ · iPadOS 18.5+ · Mac Catalyst 18.5+ · macOS 15.5+ · tvOS 18.5+ · visionOS 2.5+ · watchOS 11.5+

Solve the equation `Subfactor * x = b` for the vector `x` of complex double values, in place.

## Declaration

```objectivec
static void SparseSolve(SparseOpaqueSubfactor_Complex_Double Subfactor, DenseVector_Complex_Double xb, void *workspace);
```

## Parameters

- `Subfactor`: (Input) The subfactor to solve a system involving, as returned by `SparseCreateSubfactor()`.
- `xb`: (Input/Output) On input, the vector `b`. On return it is overwritten with the solution vector `x`. If `Subfactor` is `m x n`, then `xb` must have length `k`, where `k = max(m, n)`. If `m != n`, then only the first `min(m,n)` entries are used for input or output as approriate.
- `workspace`: (Scratch) A workspace of size `Subfactor.workspaceRequiredStatic + 1*Subfactor.workspaceRequiredPerRHS * 2`. This memory must be 16-byte aligned (any allocation returned by `malloc()` has this property).
