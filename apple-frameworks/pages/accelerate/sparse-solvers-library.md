# Sparse Solvers (Swift)

**Framework:** Accelerate  
**Kind:** API Collection

Solve systems of equations where the coefficient matrix is sparse.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

The Sparse Solvers library in the Accelerate framework handles the solution of systems of equations where the coefficient matrix is sparse. That is, most of the entries in the matrix are zero. The Sparse Solvers library provides a sparse counterpart to the dense factorizations and linear solvers that LAPACK provides.

Many problems in science and technology require the solution of large systems of simultaneous equations. When these equations are linear, you usually represent them as the matrix equation *Ax = b*. Even when the equations are nonlinear, you often solve the problem as a sequence of linear approximations.

### Sparse matrices

Routines from libraries such as BLAS and LAPACK work with matrices that you store as a 2D dense array of floating-point values. However, the algorithms you use to manipulate matrices and solve equations normally require *O(n\_²*)\_ data and *O(n\_³*)\_ operations. As a result, scaling to a large *n* is prohibitive.

To avoid the expense of these algorithms, you can leverage the fact that in many real-world applications, matrices can contain many entries that are zero. Such matrices are called *sparse* (conversely, nonsparse matrices are called *dense*).

These zeros arise naturally in these types of situations:

- ****Sparse data sets****: For example, each user buys only a small fraction of the products from a retailer.
- ****Limited connectivity****: For example, most people on social networks only connect to a tiny proportion of the entire user base.
- ****Physical properties****: For example, points on structural meshes only connect to locally adjacent points.

By exploiting these zero entries, you can often reduce the storage and computational requirements to *O(𝜏\*n)* and *O(𝜏\*n\_²*),\_ respectively, where *𝜏* is the average number of entries in each column. This reduction makes the solution of large problems (*n* in the millions or larger) tractable on most computers.

For example, the sparse benchmark matrix *ldoor*, which arises from structural modeling, has 952,200 x 952,200 entries with an average of 25 nonzero [Double](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/double) entries per column. The following table shows the number of floating-point operations (1 Tflop is 10¹² floating-point operations) and the memory necessary to perform Cholesky factorization on that matrix:

|  | Floating-point operations | Memory |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dense | 287,782 Tflop | 6800 GB |
| Sparse | 0.0783 Tflop | 1.2 GB |

### Solution approaches

The Accelerate framework offers two solution approaches:

- **Direct methods** perform a factorization such as Cholesky (*A = LLᵀ*) or QR. These methods provide a fast and accurate opaque solution.
- **Iterative methods** find an approximate solution requiring only repeated multiplication by *A* or *Aᵀ*. Although they require less memory than direct methods, and can be faster for very large problems, they typically require problem-specific preconditioners to be effective.

The following table summarizes the differences between direct methods and iterative methods:

|  | Direct methods | Iterative methods |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ease of use | Simple | Complex |
| Accuracy | Machine precision | Square root of machine precision |
| Speed | Fast for small problems ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.accelerate/spacer.png) Quite fast for larger problems | Fastest for large problems, but only with a suitable problem-specific preconditioner |
| Memory requirements | High | Low |

In contrast to direct methods, iterative methods provide a way for expert users to find approximate solutions faster using less memory. You can also use iterative methods when forming the explicit matrix is prohibitively expensive, but performing matrix-vector multiplications is performant. However, to achieve these gains, you need to select an appropriate preconditioner (an operator that approximates the inverse of *A*) that’s specific to your problem. It’s best to try a direct method before trying to use iterative methods.

### Iterative refinement

It’s sometimes possible to improve the accuracy of the solution to *Ax = b* using *iterative refinement*. After finding an initial solution, iterative refinement reuses the factorization to find a series of small corrections with the aim of reducing the backward error.

The following code shows how to refine the values in the unknowns vector, *x*, over a fixed number of iterations:

```swift
// The coefficient matrix, `A`.
let A: SparseMatrix_Double! = [ ... ]

// The right-hand-side vector, `b`.
let b: DenseVector_Double! = [ ... ]

// The factorization of `A` computed by `SparseFactor()`.
let factorization: SparseOpaqueFactorization_Double! = [ ... ]

// The unknowns vector, `x` computed by `SparseSolve()`.
let x: DenseVector_Double! = [ ... ]

let count = Int(x.count)
let n = vDSP_Length(count)

let residualData = UnsafeMutableBufferPointer<Double>.allocate(capacity: count)
let residual = DenseVector_Double(count: Int32(count), data: residualData.baseAddress!)

let correctionData = UnsafeMutableBufferPointer<Double>.allocate(capacity: count)
let correction = DenseVector_Double(count: Int32(count), data: correctionData.baseAddress!)

defer {
    residualData.deallocate()
    correctionData.deallocate()
}

let maximumIteratons = 3

for _ in 0 ..< maximumIteratons {
    
    // Calculate residual r = Ax - b.
    vDSP_vnegD(b.data, 1,
               residual.data, 1,
               n)
    SparseMultiplyAdd(A, x, residual);
    
    // Solve for correction and update x.
    SparseSolve(factorization, residual, correction);
    
    // vDSP operation that calculates `x[i] -= correction[i]` for
    // `i` in `0 ..< n`.
    vDSP_vsubD(correction.data, 1,
               x.data, 1,
               x.data, 1,
               n)
}
```

### Sparse Solvers and multithreading

By default, the Sparse Solvers library runs in multithreaded mode. Because multithreaded mode may sum child nodes and their ancestors in different orders, the solutions that the library provides may be different — although equally valid — across different runs.

To ensure that results are deterministic, set `VECLIB_MAXIMUM_THREADS=1` to specify single-threaded mode.
