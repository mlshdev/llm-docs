# vDSP_fft2d_zropt

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** Accelerate  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** iOS 4.0+ · iPadOS 4.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.0+ · tvOS · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

Computes a 2D forward or inverse out-of-place, single-precision real FFT using a temporary buffer.

## Declaration

```objectivec
extern void vDSP_fft2d_zropt(FFTSetup __Setup, const DSPSplitComplex *__A, vDSP_Stride __IA0, vDSP_Stride __IA1, const DSPSplitComplex *__C, vDSP_Stride __IC0, vDSP_Stride __IC1, const DSPSplitComplex *__Buffer, vDSP_Length __Log2N0, vDSP_Length __Log2N1, FFTDirection __Direction);
```

## Parameters

- `__Setup`: The FFT setup structure for this transform. The setup’s structure `Log2N` must be greater than or equal to this function’s `Log2N0` and `Log2N1`.
- `__A`: A pointer to the input data.
- `__IA0`: The stride between the elements in a row of `A`, set to 1 for best performance.
- `__IA1`: The increment, in elements, between consecutive elements in a column of `A,` which is also the distance between adjacent rows of `A`. Unless `A` is a submatrix, pass `0` to have the function calculate the default column stride as the row stride ( `__IA0)` multiplied by the column count.
- `__C`: A pointer to the output data.
- `__IC0`: The stride between the elements in a row of `C`, set to 1 for best performance.
- `__IC1`: The increment, in elements, between consecutive elements in a column of `C,` which is also the distance between adjacent rows of `C`. Unless `C` is a submatrix, pass `0` to have the function calculate the default column stride as the row stride ( `__IC0)` multiplied by the column count.
- `__Buffer`: A temporary vector that the operation uses for storing interim results. The real and imaginary parts of the buffer must both contain `2`max(Log2N0, Log2N1)`/2` elements. For best performance, the buffer addresses must be 16-byte aligned or better.
- `__Log2N0`: The base 2 exponent of the number of columns to process for each row.
- `__Log2N1`: The base 2 exponent of the number of rows to process. For example, to process 64 rows of 128 columns, specify `7` for `Log2N0` and `6` for `Log2N1`.
- `__Direction`: A flag that specifies the transform direction. Pass [kFFTDirection_Forward](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/kernel/1645049-anonymous/kfftdirection_forward) to transform from the spatial domain to the frequency domain. Pass [kFFTDirection_Inverse](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/kernel/1645049-anonymous/kfftdirection_inverse) to transform from the frequency domain to the spatial domain.
