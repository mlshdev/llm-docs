# Creating a Core Graphics Image from a vImage Buffer (Swift)

**Framework:** Accelerate

Create displayable representations of vImage buffers.

## Overview

vImage provides a function for creating Core Graphics images from vImage buffers. This function allows you to display the results of a vImage operation to your user.

<a id="Create-the-Image"></a>

### Create the Image

You create a Core Graphics image from the buffer, and initialize a [UIImage](../uikit/uiimage.md) instance from that. The [createCGImage(format:flags:)](vimage_buffer/createcgimage%28format_flags_%29.md) function returns a [CGImage](../coregraphics/cgimage.md) instance based on the supplied Core Graphics image format (for more information, see [Converting bitmap data between Core Graphics images and vImage buffers](converting-bitmap-data-between-core-graphics-images-and-vimage-buffers.md)).

The following example shows how to create a Core Graphics image from a vImage buffer:

```swift
let result = try? destinationBuffer.createCGImage(format: format)

if let result = result {
    // Assumes `imageView` is a `UIImageView`
    imageView.image = UIImage(cgImage: result)
}
```
