# BNNSCreateNearestNeighbors(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Accelerate  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** iOS 17.0+ · iPadOS 17.0+ · Mac Catalyst 17.0+ · macOS 14.0+ · tvOS 17.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 10.0+

Returns a new k-nearest neighbors object.

## Declaration

```swift
func BNNSCreateNearestNeighbors(_ max_n_samples: UInt32, _ n_features: UInt32, _ n_neighbors: UInt32, _ data_type: BNNSDataType, _ filter_params: UnsafePointer<BNNSFilterParameters>?) -> BNNSNearestNeighbors?
```

## Parameters

- `max_n_samples`: The maximum number of data points.
- `n_features`: The number of features or dimensions of each data point.
- `n_neighbors`: The number of nearest neighbors that a subsequent call to [BNNSNearestNeighborsGetInfo(\_:\_:\_:\_:)](bnnsnearestneighborsgetinfo%28________%29.md) calculates.
- `data_type`: The data type of the data points. This must be either `BNNSDataTypeFloat32` or `BNNSDataTypeFloat16`.
- `filter_params`: The filter runtime parameters.

## Discussion

The following code generates eight 2D data points and loads them into a k-nearest neighbors object with a single call to the [BNNSNearestNeighborsLoad(\_:\_:\_:)](bnnsnearestneighborsload%28______%29.md) function. The code then computes the four nearest neighbors, based on Euclidean distance, to the sample data point at index 7 of the samples data.

```swift
let samples: [Float] = [
    1, 2,   // 0
    7, 2,   // 1
    3, 4,   // 2
    8, 4,   // 3
    3, 7,   // 4
    7, 7,   // 5
    2, 8,   // 6
    2, 5    // 7
]

let maximumSampleCount: UInt32 = 8
let dimensionCount: UInt32 = 2
let nearestNeighborCount: UInt32 = 4

let knn = BNNSCreateNearestNeighbors(
    maximumSampleCount,
    dimensionCount,
    nearestNeighborCount,
    BNNSDataType.float,
    nil)

defer {
    BNNSDestroyNearestNeighbors(knn)
}

BNNSNearestNeighborsLoad(
    knn,
    UInt32(samples.count) / dimensionCount,
    samples)

var indices = [Int32](repeating: 0,
                      count: Int(nearestNeighborCount))
var distances = [Float](repeating: 0,
                        count: Int(nearestNeighborCount))

let sampleDataPointIndex = 7
BNNSNearestNeighborsGetInfo(
    knn,
    Int32(sampleDataPointIndex),
    &indices,
    &distances)
```

On return, the `indices` array contains the values `[7, 2, 4, 6]` and the distances array contains the values `[0.0, 1.4142135, 2.236068, 3.0]`.
