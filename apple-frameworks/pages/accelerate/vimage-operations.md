# vImage Operations (Swift)

**Framework:** Accelerate

Apply image manipulation operations to vImage buffers.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

A vImage function name includes the data type of the buffer it operates on. For example, [vImageConvolve_Planar8(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:)](vimageconvolve_planar8%28______________________%29.md) works with 8-bit planar buffers, and [vImageConvolve_ARGBFFFF(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:)](vimageconvolve_argbffff%28____________________%29.md) works with 32-bits-per-channel, four-channel interleaved buffers.
