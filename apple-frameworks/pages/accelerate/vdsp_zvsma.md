# vDSP_zvsma

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** Accelerate  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** iOS 4.0+ · iPadOS 4.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.4+ · tvOS · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

Calculates the single-precision element-wise addition of the product of a complex vector and a complex scalar value, and a complex vector, using the specified stride.

## Declaration

```objectivec
extern void vDSP_zvsma(const DSPSplitComplex *__A, vDSP_Stride __IA, const DSPSplitComplex *__B, const DSPSplitComplex *__C, vDSP_Stride __IC, const DSPSplitComplex *__D, vDSP_Stride __ID, vDSP_Length __N);
```

## Parameters

- `__A`: The input vector `A` in `D = (A * B) + C`.
- `__IA`: The distance between the elements in the input vector `A`.
- `__B`: The input scalar value `B` in `D = (A * B) + C`.
- `__C`: The input vector `C` in `D = (A * B) + C`.
- `__IC`: The distance between the elements in the input vector `C`.
- `__D`: The output vector `D` in `D = (A * B) + C`.
- `__ID`: The distance between the elements in the output vector `D`.
- `__N`: The number of elements that the function processes.

## Discussion

This function calculates the element-wise product of vector `A` and scalar value `B`, adds vector `C` to the product, and writes the result to vector `D`.

```swift
 for (n = 0; n < N; ++n)
    D[n] = A[n] * B + C[n];
```

The following code shows an example of using this function:

```swift
    let stride = 1
    let count = 5
    
    let a: [Float] = [ 1,  2,  3,  4,  5]
    let b: Float = 10
    let c: [Float] = [ 5,  4,  3,  2,  1]
    
    let d = [Float](unsafeUninitializedCapacity: count) {
        buffer, initializedCount in
        
        vDSP_vsma(a, stride,
                  [b],
                  c, stride,
                  buffer.baseAddress!, stride,
                  vDSP_Length(count))
        
        initializedCount = count
    }
    
    // Prints "[15.0, 24.0, 33.0, 42.0, 51.0]".
    print(d)
```
