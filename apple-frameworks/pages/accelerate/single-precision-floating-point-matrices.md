# Single-precision floating-point matrices

**Interface languages:** Swift, Objective-C

**Framework:** Accelerate  
**Kind:** API Collection

Perform operations on matrices that contain single-precision floating-point elements.

## Overview

A matrix is a 2D array of values arranged in rows and columns. The simd library provides support for matrices of up to four rows and four columns. It uses a column-major naming convention; for example, a [simd_float4x2](../simd/simd_float4x2.md) is a matrix that contains four columns and two rows.

## Topics

### Matrix structures

- [simd_float2x2](../simd/simd_float2x2.md): A matrix of two columns and two rows that contains single-precision values.
- [simd_float2x3](../simd/simd_float2x3.md): A matrix of two columns and three rows that contains single-precision values.
- [simd_float2x4](../simd/simd_float2x4.md): A matrix of two columns and four rows that contains single-precision values.
- [simd_float3x2](../simd/simd_float3x2.md): A matrix of three columns and two rows that contains single-precision values.
- [simd_float3x3](../simd/simd_float3x3.md): A matrix of three columns and three rows that contains single-precision values.
- [simd_float3x4](../simd/simd_float3x4.md): A matrix of three columns and four rows that contains single-precision values.
