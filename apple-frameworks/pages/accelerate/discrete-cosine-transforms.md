# Discrete Cosine transforms (Swift)

**Framework:** Accelerate  
**Kind:** API Collection

Transform vectors of temporal and spatial domain real values to the frequency domain, and vice versa.

## Topics

### First Steps

- [Signal extraction from noise](signal-extraction-from-noise.md): Use Accelerate’s discrete cosine transform to remove noise from a signal.
- [Equalizing audio with discrete cosine transforms (DCTs)](equalizing-audio-with-discrete-cosine-transforms-dcts.md): Change the frequency response of an audio signal by manipulating frequency-domain data.

### Objects that Simplify Discrete Cosine Transforms

- [vDSP.DCT](vdsp/dct.md): A single-precision discrete cosine transform.
- [vDSP.DCTTransformType](vdsp/dcttransformtype.md): An enumeration that describes the discrete cosine transform types.

### Discrete Cosine Transforms

The functions in the Discrete Cosine Transforms (DCT) family calculate a discrete cosine transform of a specified length on a vector.

- [vDSP_DCT_Type](vdsp_dct_type.md): Constants that indicate the type for a discrete cosine transform.
