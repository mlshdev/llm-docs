# SparseCreateSubfactor(\_:\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Accelerate  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** iOS 18.5+ · iPadOS 18.5+ · Mac Catalyst 18.5+ · macOS 15.5+ · tvOS 18.5+ · visionOS 2.5+ · watchOS 11.5+

Returns an opaque object representing a sub-factor of a factorization in complex double.

## Declaration

```swift
func SparseCreateSubfactor(_ subfactor: SparseSubfactor_t, _ Factor: SparseOpaqueFactorization_Complex_Double) -> SparseOpaqueSubfactor_Complex_Double
```

## Parameters

- `subfactor`: The sub-factor the new object should represent.
- `Factor`: The factorization to extract the sub-factor from.

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

Object representing the requested sub-factor. Must be cleaned up by a call to `SparseCleanup` once it is no longer required.

<a id="discussion"></a>

## Discussion

Here the term “sub-factor” is used to mean one or more parts of the whole factorization. For example, just the `Q` factor from `A=QRP`. The returned object is a wrapper around the orignal factorization, and does not actually perform any extraction (sub-factors are stored in non-standard formats that exploit implicit structure for efficiency, and formation of the sub-factor explicitly can be expensive). It is intended to be used as an argument to `SparseMultiply` and `SparseSolve` functions only.

As `Factor` is contained in the returned object, its underlying reference count in incremented, and the returned object must hence be destroyed through a call to `SparseCleanup` to prevent a memory leak (however it is safe to call `SparseCleanup` on the original factorization whilst this object is still being used).
