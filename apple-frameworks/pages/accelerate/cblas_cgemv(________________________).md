# cblas_cgemv(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Accelerate  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** iOS 16.4+ · iPadOS 16.4+ · Mac Catalyst 16.4+ · macOS 13.3+ · tvOS 16.4+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 9.4+

Multiplies a matrix by a vector (single-precision complex).

## Declaration

```swift
func cblas_cgemv(_ ORDER: CBLAS_ORDER, _ TRANSA: CBLAS_TRANSPOSE, _ M: __LAPACK_int, _ N: __LAPACK_int, _ ALPHA: OpaquePointer, _ A: OpaquePointer?, _ LDA: __LAPACK_int, _ X: OpaquePointer?, _ INCX: __LAPACK_int, _ BETA: OpaquePointer, _ Y: OpaquePointer?, _ INCY: __LAPACK_int)
```

## Parameters

- `ORDER`: Specifies row-major (C) or column-major (Fortran) data ordering.
- `TRANSA`: Specifies whether to transpose matrix `A`.
- `M`: Number of rows in matrix `A`.
- `N`: Number of columns in matrix `A`.
- `ALPHA`: Scaling factor for the product of matrix `A` and vector `X`.
- `A`: Matrix A.
- `LDA`: The size of the first dimension of matrix `A`; if you are passing a matrix `A[m][n]`, the value should be `m`.
- `X`: Vector X.
- `INCX`: Stride within `X`. For example, if `incX` is 7, every 7th element is used.
- `BETA`: Scaling factor for vector `Y`.
- `Y`: Vector Y
- `INCY`: Stride within Y. For example, if incY is 7, every 7th element is used.

## Discussion

This function multiplies `A * X` (after transposing `A`, if needed) and multiplies the resulting matrix by `alpha`. It then multiplies vector `Y` by `beta`. It stores the sum of these two products in vector `Y`.

Thus, it calculates either

`Y←αAX + βY`

with optional use of the transposed form of `A`.

>  Apple provides the BLAS and LAPACK libraries under the Accelerate framework to be in line with LAPACK 3.9.1. Starting with iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, tvOS 26, visionOS 26, and watchOS 26, the libraries are in line with LAPACK 3.12.0. These new interfaces provide additional functionality, as well as a new ILP64 interface. To use the new interfaces, define `ACCELERATE_NEW_LAPACK` before including the Accelerate or vecLib headers. For ILP64 interfaces, also define `ACCELERATE_LAPACK_ILP64`. For Swift projects, specify `ACCELERATE_NEW_LAPACK=1` and `ACCELERATE_LAPACK_ILP64=1` as preprocessor macros in Xcode build settings under Apple Clang - Preprocessing \> Preprocessor Macros.
