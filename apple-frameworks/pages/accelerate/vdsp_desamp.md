# vDSP_desamp

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** Accelerate  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** iOS 4.0+ · iPadOS 4.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.4+ · tvOS · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

Performs single-precision FIR filtering with decimation and antialiasing.

## Declaration

```objectivec
extern void vDSP_desamp(const float *__A, vDSP_Stride __DF, const float *__F, float *__C, vDSP_Length __N, vDSP_Length __P);
```

## Parameters

- `__A`: Single-precision real input vector. The size of `A` must be at least `DF * (N-1) + P` (see below).
- `__DF`: Decimation factor.
- `__F`: Single-precision real filter vector.
- `__C`: Single-precision real output vector.
- `__N`: Length of output vector `C`.
- `__P`: Length of filter vector `F`.

## Discussion

Performs finite impulse response (FIR) filtering at selected positions of the input vector `A`, with the filter `F`, using the decimation factor `DF`. Results are left in the output vector `C`.

This function can run in place, but `C` cannot be in place with `F`.

This function’s operation is indicated by the following pseudocode:

```objc
for (n = 0; n < N; ++n)
{
    sum = 0;
    for (p = 0; p < P; ++p)
        sum += A[n * DF + p] * F[p];
    C[n] = sum;
}
```

> **Note**

>  The [vDSP_desamp](vdsp_desamp.md) function may rearrange the order of operations and use various floating-point precisions, so actual results may not be calculated in exactly the same way as the pseudocode above.
