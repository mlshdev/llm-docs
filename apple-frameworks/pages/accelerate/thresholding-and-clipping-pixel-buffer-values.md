# Thresholding and clipping pixel buffer values

**Framework:** Accelerate  
**Kind:** API Collection

Limit the values in a pixel buffer to a threshold or a range.

## Topics

### Clipping

- [clip(to:destination:)](vimage/pixelbuffer/clip%28to_destination_%29.md): Conforms when `Format` conforms to `StaticPixelFormat` and `Format.ComponentType` is `Float`. Clips the values of a 32-bit pixel buffer to the specified bounds.

### Threshold

- [colorThreshold(\_:destination:)](vimage/pixelbuffer/colorthreshold%28__destination_%29.md): Conforms when `Format` conforms to `StaticPixelFormat` and `Format.ComponentType` is `Float`. Creates a binary image from a 32-bit pixel buffer.
