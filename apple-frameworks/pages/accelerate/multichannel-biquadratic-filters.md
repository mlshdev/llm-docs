# Multichannel biquadratic filters (Swift)

**Framework:** Accelerate  
**Kind:** API Collection

Filter a multichannel signal with a cascade of biquadratic sections.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

The vDSP library implements biquadratic filtering as a cascade of individual infinite impulse response (IIR) filters called *sections.* Each section has its own set of feedback and feedforward coefficients, and implements a direct-form 2 filter.

When the biquadratic filter function executes, the sections execute in sequence. Each section processes the entire input signal and passes its output to the next section for further processing.

> **Note**

>  The vDSP biquadratic filters work in place. That is, the source and destination pointers may point to the same memory.

> **Note on performance and energy efficiency**

>  Although you can use [vDSP_biquadm](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/kernel/1579994-vdsp_biquadm) to process a single channel of data, it’s optimized for processing multiple channels of data independently. When processing only a single channel, the single-channel API [vDSP_biquad](vdsp_biquad.md) may provide better performance and energy efficiency. When processing a single channel in isolation, it’s best practice to use [vDSP_biquad](vdsp_biquad.md) whenever possible.
