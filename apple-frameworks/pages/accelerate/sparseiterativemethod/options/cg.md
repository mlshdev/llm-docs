## Discussion

Use CG to solve Ax=b when A is symmetric (Hermitian) positive-definite (the method may break down or fail to converge if A is not positive-definite).

For square, full rank unsymmetric or indefinite equations, use GMRES instead. For rectangular or singular systems, use LSMR instead.

- **`reportError`**: Function to use to report parameter errors.

  If `NULL`, errors are logged via `<os/log.h>` and execution is halted via `__builtin_trap()`.  If non-`NULL`, the provided function is called with a human-readable string describing the error condition. If the callback returns, control will be returned to the caller with any outputs in a safe but undefined state (i.e. they may hold partial results or garbage, but all sizes and pointers are valid).
- **`maxIterations`**: Maximum number of iterations to perform. If 0, the default value of 100 is used.
- **`atol`**: Absolute convergence tolerance. Iterate is considered to have converged if

  ```
  || b-Ax ||_2 < rtol * || b-Ax_0 ||_2 + atol
  ```
- **`rtol`**: Relative convergence tolerance. Iterate is considered to have converged if

  ```
  || b-Ax ||_2 < rtol * || b-Ax_0 ||_2 + atol
  ```

  If `rtol = 0.0`, default value of `sqrt(epsilon)` is used.

  If negative, `rtol` is treated as `0.0` (default is not used).
- **`reportStatus`**: Function to use to report status (iteration count and residual of first right-hand side) every few iterations. If `NULL`, status is not reported.
