# SparseRefactor(\_:\_:\_:\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Accelerate  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** iOS 11.0+ · iPadOS 11.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.13+ · tvOS 11.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 4.0+

Computes a factorization of the specified double-precision matrix using an existing factorization’s storage and specified options, and without internal memory allocation.

## Declaration

func SparseRefactor(_ Matrix: SparseMatrix_Double, _ Factored: UnsafeMutablePointer<SparseOpaqueFactorization_Double>, _ nfoptions: SparseNumericFactorOptions, _ workspace: UnsafeMutableRawPointer)
```

## Parameters

- `Matrix`: The matrix that contains numerical data to recompute.
- `Factored`: The factorization to recompute.
- `nfoptions`: The numeric factor options, such as the scaling method to use.
- `workspace`: A pointer to a workspace of size at least `symbolicFactorization.workspaceSize_Double` bytes.

## Discussion

Use this function to calculate the factorization of a sparse matrix to pass to the direct solve functions using an existing factorization’s storage. The specified matrix must have the same sparsity structure as the matrix of the original factorization. In cases where your code calls the function frequently, create and manage the workspace that the Sparse Solvers library uses and reuse it across function calls. Reusing a workspace prevents the Sparse Solvers library from allocating the temporary storage with each call.

This function provides behavior similar to [SparseFactor(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:)](sparsefactor%28__________%29-68hki.md) by reusing explicit storage that you supply to [SparseFactor(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:)](sparsefactor%28__________%29-68hki.md) as the argument `factorStorage`. However, in addition to providing a simplified call sequence, this call can also reuse any additional storage that you allocate to accommodate delayed pivots.

The following figure shows two systems of equations where the coefficient matrix is sparse:

![A mathematical equation that has two stacked sets of three simultaneous equations on the left. Each equation has three unknowns. The same sets of simultaneous equations appear on the right as two matrix equations, A x equals B. Each matrix equation consists of a three-by-three matrix multiplied by a three-element column matrix that equals a three-element column matrix.](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.accelerate/media-3703909@2x.png)

The following code solves these two systems with refactoring. After factorizing and solving for the coefficient matrix *A0*, the code refactors and solves for matrix *A1*.

```swift
/// Define the sparsity structure of matrices `A0` and `A1`.
let rowIndices: [Int32] =    [ 0, 1, 1, 2]
let columnIndices: [Int32] = [ 2, 0, 2, 1]

/// Create the single-precision coefficient matrix _A0_.
let a0Values: [Double] = [10, 20, 5, 50]
let A0 = SparseConvertFromCoordinate(3, 3,
                                     4, 1,
                                     SparseAttributes_t(),
                                     rowIndices, columnIndices,
                                     a0Values)

/// Factorize _A0_.
var factorization = SparseFactor(SparseFactorizationQR, A0)

/// Solve _A0 · x = b0_ in place.
var b0Values: [Double] = [30, 35, 100]
b0Values.withUnsafeMutableBufferPointer { bPtr in
    let xb = DenseVector_Double(count: 3,
                               data: bPtr.baseAddress!)
    
    SparseSolve(factorization, xb)
}

/// Create the double-precision coefficient matrix _A1_.
let a1Values: [Double] = [5, 10, 2.5, 25]
let A1 = SparseConvertFromCoordinate(3, 3,
                                     4, 1,
                                     SparseAttributes_t(),
                                     rowIndices, columnIndices,
                                     a1Values)

/// Create the workspace.
let byteCount = factorization.symbolicFactorization.workspaceSize_Double
let workspace = UnsafeMutableRawPointer.allocate(
    byteCount: byteCount,
    alignment: MemoryLayout<Double>.alignment)
defer {
    workspace.deallocate()
}

/// Factorize _A1_ into the existing factorization.
let numericFactorOptions = SparseNumericFactorOptions()
SparseRefactor(A1, &factorization,
               numericFactorOptions, workspace)

/// Solve _A1 · x = b1_ in place.
var b1Values: [Double] = [60, 70, 200]
b1Values.withUnsafeMutableBufferPointer { bPtr in
    let xb = DenseVector_Double(count: 3,
                                data: bPtr.baseAddress!)
    
    SparseSolve(factorization, xb)
}

SparseCleanup(A0)
SparseCleanup(A1)
SparseCleanup(factorization)
```

On return, `b0Values` contains the values `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]`, and `b1Values` contains the values `[4.0, 8.0, 12.0]`.
