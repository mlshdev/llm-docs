# SparseSolve(\_:\_:\_:\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Accelerate  
**Kind:** Function

func SparseSolve(_ method: SparseIterativeMethod, _ A: SparseMatrix_Float, _ b: DenseVector_Float, _ x: DenseVector_Float) -> SparseIterativeStatus_t
```

## Parameters

- `method`: The iterative method.

## Discussion

Use this function to solve a system of linear equations using a factored coefficient matrix. The following figure shows a system of equations where the coefficient matrix is sparse:

![A mathematical equation that has one set of three simultaneous equations on the left. Each equation has three unknowns. The same set of simultaneous equations appears on the right as a single matrix equation, A x equals B. The single matrix equation consists of a three-by-three matrix multiplied by a three-element column matrix that equals a three-element column matrix.](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.accelerate/media-3703927@2x.png)

The following code solves this system using the least squares minimum residual method:

```swift
/// Create the coefficient matrix _A_.
let rowIndices: [Int32] =    [ 0,  1, 1,  2]
let columnIndices: [Int32] = [ 2,  0, 2,  1]
let aValues: [Float] =      [10, 20, 5, 50]

let A = SparseConvertFromCoordinate(3, 3,
                                    4, 1,
                                    SparseAttributes_t(),
                                    rowIndices, columnIndices,
                                    aValues)
defer {
    SparseCleanup(A)
}

/// Create the right-hand-side vector, _b_.
var bValues: [Float] = [30, 35, 100]
var xValues = [Float](repeating: .nan, count: bValues.count)

bValues.withUnsafeMutableBufferPointer { bPtr in
    xValues.withUnsafeMutableBufferPointer { xPtr in
        
        let b = DenseVector_Float(count: 3,
                                  data: bPtr.baseAddress!)
        
        let x = DenseVector_Float(count: 3,
                                  data: xPtr.baseAddress!)
        
        SparseSolve(SparseLSMR(), A, b, x)
    }
}
```

On return, x`Values` contains the values `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]`.
