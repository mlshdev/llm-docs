# vImageConvert_ARGB8888toPlanar16Q12(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Accelerate  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** iOS 7.0+ · iPadOS 7.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.9+ · tvOS 7.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 1.0+

Deinterleaves an 8-bit-per-channel, 4-channel interleaved buffer into four fixed-point 16-bit planar buffers.

## Declaration

```swift
func vImageConvert_ARGB8888toPlanar16Q12(_ src: UnsafePointer<vImage_Buffer>, _ alpha: UnsafePointer<vImage_Buffer>, _ red: UnsafePointer<vImage_Buffer>, _ green: UnsafePointer<vImage_Buffer>, _ blue: UnsafePointer<vImage_Buffer>, _ flags: vImage_Flags) -> vImage_Error
```

## Parameters

- `src`: The source vImage buffer.
- `alpha`: A pointer to the alpha destination vImage buffer structure. You’re responsible for filling out the [height](vimage_buffer/height.md), [width](vimage_buffer/width.md), and [rowBytes](vimage_buffer/rowbytes.md) fields of this structure, and for allocating a data buffer of the appropriate size. On return, the data buffer this structure points to contains the alpha destination image data. When you no longer need the data buffer, deallocate the memory to prevent memory leaks.
- `red`: A pointer to the red destination vImage buffer structure. You’re responsible for filling out the [height](vimage_buffer/height.md), [width](vimage_buffer/width.md), and [rowBytes](vimage_buffer/rowbytes.md) fields of this structure, and for allocating a data buffer of the appropriate size. On return, the data buffer this structure points to contains the red destination image data. When you no longer need the data buffer, deallocate the memory to prevent memory leaks.
- `green`: A pointer to the green destination vImage buffer structure. You’re responsible for filling out the [height](vimage_buffer/height.md), [width](vimage_buffer/width.md), and [rowBytes](vimage_buffer/rowbytes.md) fields of this structure, and for allocating a data buffer of the appropriate size. On return, the data buffer this structure points to contains the green destination image data. When you no longer need the data buffer, deallocate the memory to prevent memory leaks.
- `blue`: A pointer to the blue destination vImage buffer structure. You’re responsible for filling out the [height](vimage_buffer/height.md), [width](vimage_buffer/width.md), and [rowBytes](vimage_buffer/rowbytes.md) fields of this structure, and for allocating a data buffer of the appropriate size. On return, the data buffer this structure points to contains the blue destination image data. When you no longer need the data buffer, deallocate the memory to prevent memory leaks.
- `flags`: The options to use when performing the operation. If your code implements its own tiling or its own multithreading, pass [kvImageDoNotTile](kvimagedonottile.md); otherwise, pass [kvImageNoFlags](kvimagenoflags.md).

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

[kvImageNoError](kvimagenoerror.md); otherwise, one of the error codes in [Data Types and Constants](data-types-and-constants.md).

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

The function uses the following calculation to perform the conversion:

```objc
uint16_t dest = ((src << 12) + 127)/255;
```

The conversion maps source pixels with a value of `0` to `0` and `255` to `4096`.
