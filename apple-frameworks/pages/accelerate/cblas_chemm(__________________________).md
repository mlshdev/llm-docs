# cblas_chemm(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Accelerate  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** iOS 16.4+ · iPadOS 16.4+ · Mac Catalyst 16.4+ · macOS 13.3+ · tvOS 16.4+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 9.4+

Multiplies two Hermitian matrices (single-precision complex), then adds a third (with scaling).

## Declaration

```swift
func cblas_chemm(_ ORDER: CBLAS_ORDER, _ SIDE: CBLAS_SIDE, _ UPLO: CBLAS_UPLO, _ M: __LAPACK_int, _ N: __LAPACK_int, _ ALPHA: OpaquePointer, _ A: OpaquePointer?, _ LDA: __LAPACK_int, _ B: OpaquePointer?, _ LDB: __LAPACK_int, _ BETA: OpaquePointer, _ C: OpaquePointer?, _ LDC: __LAPACK_int)
```

## Parameters

- `ORDER`: Specifies row-major (C) or column-major (Fortran) data ordering.
- `SIDE`: Determines the order in which the matrices should be multiplied.
- `UPLO`: Specifies whether to use the upper or lower triangle from the matrix. Valid values are `'U'` or `'L'`.
- `M`: The number of rows in matrices `A` and `C`.
- `N`: The number of columns in matrices `B` and `C`.
- `ALPHA`: Scaling factor for the product of matrices A and B.
- `A`: Matrix A.
- `LDA`: The size of the first dimension of matrix `A`; if you are passing a matrix `A[m][n]`, the value should be `m`.
- `B`: Matrix B.
- `LDB`: The size of the first dimension of matrix `B`; if you are passing a matrix `B[m][n]`, the value should be `m`.
- `BETA`: Scaling factor for matrix C.
- `C`: Matrix C.
- `LDC`: The size of the first dimension of matrix `C`; if you are passing a matrix `C[m][n]`, the value should be `m`.

## Discussion

This function multiplies `A * B` or `B * A` (depending on the value of `Side`) and multiplies the resulting matrix by `alpha`. It then multiplies matrix `C` by `beta`. It stores the sum of these two products in matrix `C`.

Thus, it calculates either

`C←αAB + βC`

or

`C←αBA + βC`

where

`A = A`
