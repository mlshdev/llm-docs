# SparseSolve(\_:\_:\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Accelerate  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** iOS 18.5+ · iPadOS 18.5+ · Mac Catalyst 18.5+ · macOS 15.5+ · tvOS 18.5+ · visionOS 2.5+ · watchOS 11.5+

Solves the system `Ax=b` for `x`, using the supplied `SparseOpaqueFactorization_Complex_Double` of `A`.

## Declaration

```swift
func SparseSolve(_ Factored: SparseOpaqueFactorization_Complex_Double, _ b: DenseVector_Complex_Double, _ x: DenseVector_Complex_Double)
```

## Parameters

- `Factored`: A factorization of `A`.
- `b`: The right-hand side `b` to solve for. If `A` has dimension `m x n`, then `b` must have length `m`.
- `x`: Vector in which to return solution. If `A` has dimension `m x n`, then `x` must have length `n`.

## Discussion

If the factorization is `A=QR` and the system is underdetermined, the solution of minimum norm `|| x ||_2` is returned. If the factorization is `A=QR` and the system is overdetermined, the least squares solution `arg min_x || Ax - b ||_2` is returned. In the case of a factorization of `type=SparseCholeskyAtA`, the factorization is in fact of `A^T A`, so the solution returned is for the system `A^TAx=b`.
