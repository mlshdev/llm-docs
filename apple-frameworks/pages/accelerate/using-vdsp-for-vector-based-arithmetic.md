# Using vDSP for vector-based arithmetic

**Interface languages:** Swift, Objective-C

**Framework:** Accelerate  
**Kind:** Article

Increase the performance of common mathematical tasks with vDSP vector-vector and vector-scalar operations.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

vDSP provides a suite of general-purpose, high-performance arithmetic functions that are alternatives to `for` loops and `map` when applying operations on collections of floating-point values.

For example, the code below multiplies the element-wise sum of two arrays by a scalar value:

```swift
let a: [Float] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
let b: [Float] = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]
let c: Float = 2

let d = zip(a, b).map {
    ($0.0 + $0.1) * c
}

// d = [22.0, 44.0, 66.0, 88.0, 110.0, 132.0, 154.0, 176.0, 198.0, 220.0]
```

The vDSP version of the same operation runs significantly faster.

```swift
let d = [Float](unsafeUninitializedCapacity: a.count) {
    buffer, initializedCount in
    
    vDSP.multiply(addition: (a, b),
                  c,
                  result: &buffer)
    
    initializedCount = a.count
}

// d = [22.0, 44.0, 66.0, 88.0, 110.0, 132.0, 154.0, 176.0, 198.0, 220.0]
```

Many vDSP functions have a variant that returns the result.

```swift
let a: [Float] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
let b: [Float] = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]
let c: Float = 2

let d = vDSP.multiply(addition: (a, b),
                      c)
```

### Available arithmetic functions

The following table summarizes the basic arithmetic functions available in vDSP. All functions are available in single- and double-precision variants.

In the *Operation* column, a subscript (for example, `a[i]`) indicates a vector, and no subscript (for example, `a`) indicates a scalar value.
