# Single-precision floating-point vectors (Swift)

**Framework:** Accelerate  
**Kind:** API Collection

Perform operations on vectors that contain single-precision floating-point elements.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

The simd library provides many functions in this group, in three variants:

- The default variant—for example, [simd_rsqrt(\_:)](../simd/simd_rsqrt%28__%29-i4we.md)
- The precise variant—for example, [simd_precise_rsqrt(\_:)](../simd/simd_precise_rsqrt%28__%29-136xw.md)
- The fast variant—for example, [simd_fast_rsqrt(\_:)](../simd/simd_fast_rsqrt%28__%29-8p7fk.md)

The precise variants are accurate to a few units in the last place (ULPs). The fast variants provide greater speed but may have as little as 11 bits of accuracy for single-precision functions.

The compiler flag defines the behavior of the default variant. Ordinarily, the compiler resolves the default variants to their precise counterparts. Set the `-ffast-math` compiler flag to specify that the default variants of the functions resolve to the fast variants.
