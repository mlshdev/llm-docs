# sparse_insert_block_double(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Accelerate  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** iOS 9.0+ · iPadOS 9.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS 10.11+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 3.0+

Inserts a dense block of entries into a double-precision matrix.

## Declaration

```swift
func sparse_insert_block_double(_ A: sparse_matrix_double!, _ val: UnsafePointer<Double>!, _ row_stride: sparse_dimension, _ col_stride: sparse_dimension, _ bi: sparse_index, _ bj: sparse_index) -> sparse_status
```

## Parameters

- `A`: The sparse matrix, *A*,\_ \_which must have been created with [sparse_matrix_block_create_double(\_:\_:\_:\_:)](sparse_matrix_block_create_double%28________%29.md) or [sparse_matrix_variable_block_create_double(\_:\_:\_:\_:)](sparse_matrix_variable_block_create_double%28________%29.md). [SPARSE_ILLEGAL_PARAMETER](sparse_illegal_parameter.md) is returned if not met. `A` holds block dimensions (fixed or variable) set with matrix object creation routine.
- `val`: Pointer to block to be inserted at block index location `A[bi,bj]`. The block is of dimension `k * l` where `k` and `l` are set for `bi,bj` at object creation time. The strides between elements for rows and columns are provided in `row_stride` and `col_stride`.
- `row_stride`: The row stride in number of elements to move from one row to the next for the block `val`.
- `col_stride`: The column stride in number of elements to move from one column to the next for the block `val`.
- `bi`: The block row index where `val` is to be inserted. Indexing is zero based, the first block is located at `0,0`.  Index is assumed to be within the bounds of the matrix object, undefined behavior if not met.
- `bj`: The block column index where `val` is to be inserted. Indexing is zero based, the first block is located at `0,0`.  Index is assumed to be within the bounds of the matrix object, undefined behavior if not met.

## Return Value

On successful insertion, `A` has been updated with the value and [SPARSE_SUCCESS](sparse_success.md) is returned. If `A` creation requirements are not met, [SPARSE_ILLEGAL_PARAMETER](sparse_illegal_parameter.md) is returned and `A` is unchanged.

## Discussion

Use to build a sparse matrix by providing a dense block for entry at block location `A[bi,bj]`. Block size is determined at object creation time. Given a block dimension of `k * l` and for location `bi,bj`, update as: `A[bi,bj][i,j] = val[i*row_stride + j*col_stride]` for each `i` in `k` and each `j` in `l`.

Note that matrix properties cannot be modified after value insertion begins.This includes properties such as specifying a triangular matrix.Insertion can be expensive, generally speaking it is best to do a batch update. Inserted values may be temporarily held internally within the object and only inserted into the sparse format when a later computation triggers a need to insert.
