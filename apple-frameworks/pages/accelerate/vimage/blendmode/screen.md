# vImage.BlendMode.screen

**Framework:** Accelerate  
**Kind:** Case  
**Availability:** iOS 16.0+ · iPadOS 16.0+ · Mac Catalyst 16.0+ · macOS 13.0+ · tvOS 16.0+ · visionOS · watchOS 9.0+

Sets the destination pixel as the inverted product of the inverted corresponding source pixels.

## Declaration

```swift
case screen
```

## Discussion

The following image shows the result of compositing using the screen blend mode:

The bottom-right quadrant in the result is identical to the corresponding quadrant in the bottom layer because the operation multiplies each bottom-layer pixel value by `1.0`. For example, if the source pixel value is `0.5`, the destination pixel value is `0.5`:

```swift
dest = 1 - (1 - 0.5) * (1 - 0.0) // dest = 0.5
```

The top-right quadrant in the result is brighter than the corresponding quadrant in the bottom layer. In this quadrant, the top-layer and bottom-layer pixel values are identical. For example, if the source pixel value is `0.5`, the destination pixel value is `0.75`:

```swift
dest = 1 - (1 - 0.5) * (1 - 0.5) // dest = 0.75
```
