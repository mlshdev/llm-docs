## Discussion

The following image shows the result of compositing using the multiply blend mode:

The bottom-right quadrant in the result is black because the operation multiplies each bottom-layer pixel value by `0.0` from the top layer.

The top-left quadrant in the result is identical to the corresponding quadrant in the bottom layer because the operation multiplies each bottom-layer pixel value by `1.0`.

The top-right quadrant in the result is darker than the corresponding quadrant in the bottom layer. In this quadrant, the top-layer and bottom-layer pixel values are identical. For example, if the source pixel value is 0.5, the destination pixel value is `0.25`:

```swift
dest = 0.5 * 0.5 // dest = 0.25
```
