# Compressing and decompressing data with buffer compression (Swift)

**Framework:** Accelerate  
**Kind:** Article

Compress a string, write it to the file system, and decompress the same file using buffer compression.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

The code in this article uses the [Compression](../compression.md) framework to encode (compress) and decode (decompress) a string. The code writes the encoded result to the temporary directory that the [NSTemporaryDirectory()](../foundation/nstemporarydirectory%28%29.md) function returns.

The code in this sample is useful in applications that store or transmit text files where saving or sending smaller files can improve performance and reduce storage overhead. This sample app implements *buffer compression*, where it reads the contents of a source buffer in a single step to compress or decompress data.

<a id="Create-the-source-data"></a>

### Create the source data

Typically, your app would dynamically generate the source data that it compresses, but for this example, the source data is a hard-coded string.

```swift
import Compression

let sourceString = """
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipiscing elit mi
    nibh ornare proin blandit diam ridiculus, faucibus mus
    dui eu vehicula nam donec dictumst sed vivamus bibendum
    aliquet efficitur. Felis imperdiet sodales dictum morbi
    vivamus augue dis duis aliquet velit ullamcorper porttitor,
    lobortis dapibus hac purus aliquam natoque iaculis blandit
    montes nunc pretium.
    """

var sourceBuffer = Array(sourceString.utf8)
```

On return, `sourceBuffer` is an array of [UInt8](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/kernel/uint8) values that contains the UTF-8 representation of the source string.

<a id="Create-the-destination-buffer"></a>

### Create the destination buffer

Create an [UnsafeMutablePointer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/unsafemutablepointer) structure and allocate it with a capacity of the source string’s `count` to receive the encoded data.

```swift
let destinationBuffer = UnsafeMutablePointer<UInt8>.allocate(capacity: sourceString.count)

defer {
    destinationBuffer.deallocate()
}
```

<a id="Select-a-compression-algorithm"></a>

### Select a compression algorithm

The code in this example uses the [COMPRESSION_LZMESH](../compression/compression_lzmesh.md) algorithm, which provides the compression ratio of zlib level 5, but with much higher energy efficiency and speed (between 2x and 3x) for both encode and decode operations:

```swift
let algorithm = COMPRESSION_LZMESH
```

For apps that require interoperability with non-Apple devices, use [COMPRESSION_ZLIB](../compression/compression_zlib.md) instead. For more information on other compression algorithms, see [compression_algorithm](../compression/compression_algorithm.md).

<a id="Compress-the-data"></a>

### Compress the data

The [compression_encode_buffer(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:)](../compression/compression_encode_buffer%28____________%29.md) function compresses the data, writes the result to the destination buffer, and returns the size of the encoded data.

```swift
let compressedSize = compression_encode_buffer(destinationBuffer, sourceString.count,
                                               &sourceBuffer, sourceString.count,
                                               nil,
                                               algorithm)
```

When working with small files, the compression may fail and [compression_encode_buffer(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:)](../compression/compression_encode_buffer%28____________%29.md) returns `0`.

```swift
if compressedSize == 0 {
    fatalError("Encoding failed.")
}
```

You may elect to handle this situation differently, for example, by displaying a warning to the user that the compression failed.

<a id="Write-the-encoded-data-to-a-file"></a>

### Write the encoded data to a file

The code below writes the encoded data to a file in the the app’s temporary directory on macOS:

```swift
let encodedFileName = "stringEncoded.LZMESH"

let tempDirURL = NSURL(fileURLWithPath: NSTemporaryDirectory())

guard
    let encodedFileURL = tempDirURL.appendingPathComponent(encodedFileName) else {
        return
}

FileManager.default.createFile(atPath: encodedFileURL.path,
                               contents: nil,
                               attributes: nil)

guard let destinationFileHandle = try? FileHandle(forWritingTo: encodedFileURL) else {
    print("destinationFileHandle fail.")
    return
}

let encodedData = NSData(bytesNoCopy: destinationBuffer,
                         length: compressedSize,
                         freeWhenDone: false)

destinationFileHandle.write(encodedData as Data)
destinationFileHandle.closeFile()
```

<a id="Read-the-encoded-data-from-a-file"></a>

### Read the encoded data from a file

To read the encoded file, create a file handle for reading from the encoded file’s URL.

```swift
guard
    let encodedFileHandle = try? FileHandle(forReadingFrom: encodedFileURL) else {
        print("encodedFileHandle fail.")
        return
}
```

Use the file handle to read the entire encoded file and populate `encodedSourceData`.

```swift
let encodedSourceData = encodedFileHandle.readDataToEndOfFile()
```

<a id="Decompress-the-data"></a>

### Decompress the data

Allocate memory to contain the decoded data. Typically, the encoded payload would be part of a larger structure containing additional metadata such as the uncompressed size, and you’d use that to define the buffer capacity. However, for this example, allocate 8 MB:

```swift
let decodedCapacity = 8_000_000
let decodedDestinationBuffer = UnsafeMutablePointer<UInt8>.allocate(capacity: decodedCapacity)
defer {
    decodedDestinationBuffer.deallocate()
}
```

Use [compression_decode_buffer(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:)](../compression/compression_decode_buffer%28____________%29.md) to decode the raw bytes of the encoded source data and write the result to `decodedDestinationBuffer`. You can create a string from the destination buffer using the [init(cString:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/string/init%28cstring:%29-2p84k) initializer.

```swift
let decodedString: String = encodedSourceData.withUnsafeBytes { encodedSourceBuffer in
    let typedPointer = encodedSourceBuffer.bindMemory(to: UInt8.self)
    let decodedCharCount = compression_decode_buffer(decodedDestinationBuffer, decodedCapacity,
                                                     typedPointer.baseAddress!, encodedSourceData.count,
                                                     nil,
                                                     algorithm)

    return String(cString: decodedDestinationBuffer)
}
```

The [compression_decode_buffer(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:)](../compression/compression_decode_buffer%28____________%29.md) function returns the size of the decoded data. If the decompression fails, the size returned is zero. This may indicate that the memory allocated to the destination buffer is insufficient and you should switch to the stream API or retry with a larger buffer.

var sourceBuffer = Array(sourceString.utf8)
```

```

<a id="Compress-the-data"></a>

### Compress the data

The [compression_encode_buffer](../compression/compression_encode_buffer%28____________%29.md) function compresses the data, writes the result to the destination buffer, and returns the size of the encoded data.

```swift
let compressedSize = compression_encode_buffer(destinationBuffer, sourceString.count,
                                               &sourceBuffer, sourceString.count,
                                               nil,
                                               algorithm)
```

When working with small files, the compression may fail and [compression_encode_buffer](../compression/compression_encode_buffer%28____________%29.md) returns `0`.

```swift
if compressedSize == 0 {
    fatalError("Encoding failed.")
}
```

You may elect to handle this situation differently, for example, by displaying a warning to the user that the compression failed.

### Write the encoded data to a file

The code below writes the encoded data to a file in the the app’s temporary directory on macOS:

```swift
let encodedFileName = "stringEncoded.LZMESH"

let tempDirURL = NSURL(fileURLWithPath: NSTemporaryDirectory())

guard
    let encodedFileURL = tempDirURL.appendingPathComponent(encodedFileName) else {
        return
}

FileManager.default.createFile(atPath: encodedFileURL.path,
                               contents: nil,
                               attributes: nil)

guard let destinationFileHandle = try? FileHandle(forWritingTo: encodedFileURL) else {
    print("destinationFileHandle fail.")
    return
}

let encodedData = NSData(bytesNoCopy: destinationBuffer,
                         length: compressedSize,
                         freeWhenDone: false)

destinationFileHandle.write(encodedData as Data)
destinationFileHandle.closeFile()
```

<a id="Read-the-encoded-data-from-a-file"></a>

### Read the encoded data from a file

To read the encoded file, create a file handle for reading from the encoded file’s URL.

```swift
guard
    let encodedFileHandle = try? FileHandle(forReadingFrom: encodedFileURL) else {
        print("encodedFileHandle fail.")
        return
}
```

Use the file handle to read the entire encoded file and populate `encodedSourceData`.

```swift
let encodedSourceData = encodedFileHandle.readDataToEndOfFile()
```

<a id="Decompress-the-data"></a>

### Decompress the data

Allocate memory to contain the decoded data. Typically, the encoded payload would be part of a larger structure containing additional metadata such as the uncompressed size, and you’d use that to define the buffer capacity. However, for this example, allocate 8 MB:

```swift
let decodedCapacity = 8_000_000
let decodedDestinationBuffer = UnsafeMutablePointer<UInt8>.allocate(capacity: decodedCapacity)
defer {
    decodedDestinationBuffer.deallocate()
}
```

Use [compression_decode_buffer](../compression/compression_decode_buffer%28____________%29.md) to decode the raw bytes of the encoded source data and write the result to `decodedDestinationBuffer`. You can create a string from the destination buffer using the [init(cString:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/string/init%28cstring:%29-2p84k) initializer.

```swift
let decodedString: String = encodedSourceData.withUnsafeBytes { encodedSourceBuffer in
    let typedPointer = encodedSourceBuffer.bindMemory(to: UInt8.self)
    let decodedCharCount = compression_decode_buffer(decodedDestinationBuffer, decodedCapacity,
                                                     typedPointer.baseAddress!, encodedSourceData.count,
                                                     nil,
                                                     algorithm)

    return String(cString: decodedDestinationBuffer)
}
```

The [compression_decode_buffer](../compression/compression_decode_buffer%28____________%29.md) function returns the size of the decoded data. If the decompression fails, the size returned is zero. This may indicate that the memory allocated to the destination buffer is insufficient and you should switch to the stream API or retry with a larger buffer.
