## Return Value

A [SparseIterativeStatus_t](sparseiterativestatus_t.md) enumeration that represents the status of the iterative solve.

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

Use this function to solve a system of linear equations using a factored coefficient matrix. Preconditioning the coefficient matrix can reduce the number of iterations the function requires to converge the system.

The following figure shows two systems of equations where the coefficient matrix is sparse:

![A mathematical equation that has one set of three simultaneous equations on the left. Each equation has three unknowns. The same set of simultaneous equations appears on the right as a single matrix equation, A x equals B. The single matrix equation consists of a three-by-three matrix multiplied by a three-element column matrix that equals a three-element column matrix.](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.accelerate/media-3703936@2x.png)

The following code solves this system by applying a diagonal scaling preconditioner and using the least squares minimum residual method:

```swift
/// Create the coefficient matrix _A_.
let rowIndices: [Int32] =    [ 0,  1, 1,  2]
let columnIndices: [Int32] = [ 2,  0, 2,  1]
let aValues: [Float] =       [10, 20, 5, 50]

let A = SparseConvertFromCoordinate(3, 3,
                                    4, 1,
                                    SparseAttributes_t(),
                                    rowIndices, columnIndices,
                                    aValues)

defer {
    SparseCleanup(A)
}

/// Create the right-hand-side vector, _b_.
var bValues: [Float] = [30, 35, 100]
var xValues = [Float](repeating: .nan, count: bValues.count)

bValues.withUnsafeMutableBufferPointer { bPtr in
    xValues.withUnsafeMutableBufferPointer { xPtr in
        
        let b = DenseVector_Float(count: 3,
                                  data: bPtr.baseAddress!)
        
        let x = DenseVector_Float(count: 3,
                                  data: xPtr.baseAddress!)
        
        SparseSolve(SparseLSMR(),
                    A, b, x,
                    SparsePreconditionerDiagScaling)
    }
}
```

On return, x`Values` contains the values `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]`.
