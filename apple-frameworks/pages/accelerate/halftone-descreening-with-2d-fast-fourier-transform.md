# Halftone descreening with 2D fast Fourier transform (Swift)

**Framework:** Accelerate  
**Kind:** Sample Code  
**Availability:** macOS 13.0+ · Xcode 14.0+

Reduce or remove periodic artifacts from images.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

Accelerate’s vDSP module provides functions to perform 2D fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) on matrices of data, such as images. You can exploit the amplitude peaks in the frequency domain of periodic patterns, such as halftone screens, to reduce or remove such artifacts from images. The example below shows an image with halftone artifacts (left) and the same image with the halftone artifacts reduced (right):

![A comparison of the original image of a flower with its descreened counterpart. A zoomed-in segment of the original image shows pronounced diagonal halftone lines. In the descreened image, the same close-up segment appears smoother, with more continuous tones.](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.accelerate/halftone_descreen_2x.png)

The sample app reduces halftone artifacts from a source image by first performing forward FFTs on the image and a halftone screen sample. The following image shows the positive frequencies of the halftone sample’s frequency-domain representation. For more information on performing Fourier transforms on 2D data, see [Understanding data packing for Fourier transforms](understanding-data-packing-for-fourier-transforms.md).

![An image of the frequency-domain representation of the halftone screen containing a series of bright star shapes. The stars follow a diagonal path from the top-left to the middle-right of the image and decrease in size from left to right.](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.accelerate/halftone_frequency_domain_2x.png)

The descreening operation zeroes frequency-domain values in the source image that correspond to the bright peaks in the halftone sample’s frequency-domain values.

### Convert the image data to a split-complex vector

The vImage [vImageBuffer_InitWithCGImage(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:)](vimagebuffer_initwithcgimage%28__________%29.md) function converts the source Core Graphics image to an array of single-precision values. The sample app creates its own backing storage, `pixelsStorage`, rather than using [vImageBuffer_Init(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:)](vimagebuffer_init%28__________%29.md) to ensure that the vImage buffer doesn’t contain any additional padding bytes.

```swift
let pixelsStorage = UnsafeMutableBufferPointer<Float>.allocate(capacity: pixelCount)
defer {
    pixelsStorage.deallocate()
}

var tmpBuffer = vImage_Buffer(
    data: pixelsStorage.baseAddress,
    height: vImagePixelCount(cgImage.height),
    width: vImagePixelCount(cgImage.width),
    rowBytes: cgImage.width * MemoryLayout<Float>.stride)

vImageBuffer_InitWithCGImage(
    &tmpBuffer,
    &Self.imageFormat,
    [0, 0, 0, 0],
    cgImage,
    vImage_Flags(kvImageNoAllocate))
```

The [vDSP_ctoz](vdsp_ctoz.md) function converts the interleaved pixel values to split-complex format. The function copies odd-numbered pixels to the real parts and the even-numbered pixels to the imaginary parts of each complex value.

```swift
pixelsStorage.withMemoryRebound(to: DSPComplex.self) {
    
    vDSP_ctoz([DSPComplex]($0), 2,
              &self.dspSplitComplex, 1,
              vDSP_Length(complexValuesCount))
}
```

<a id="Create-the-FFT-setup-object"></a>

### Create the FFT setup object

The sample app creates an FFT setup object that contains all the information required to perform the forward and inverse 2D FFT operations. Creating this setup object can be expensive, so the sample only performs this initialization once.

The following code creates a setup object suitable for performing forward and inverse 2D FFTs on a 1024 x 1024 pixel image:

```swift
static let fftSetUp = vDSP.FFT2D(width: imageWidth,
                                 height: imageHeight,
                                 ofType: DSPSplitComplex.self)!
```

<a id="Prepare-arrays-for-transformed-image-data"></a>

### Prepare arrays for transformed image data

Rather than allocating and deallocating memory with each call to the descreening code, the sample app declares several `SplitComplex` structures and an array that the descreening operation uses.

```swift
/// The `SplitComplex` structure that stores the source image frequency-domain pixels.
var imageFrequencyDomainPixels = SplitComplex(count: HalftoneDescreener.complexValuesCount)

/// The `SplitComplex` structure that stores the halftone sample frequency-domain pixels.
var halftoneFrequencyDomainPixels = SplitComplex(count: HalftoneDescreener.complexValuesCount)

/// The array that stores the square magnitudes of the halftone frequency-domain values.
var halftoneSampleAmplitudes = [Float](repeating: 0,
                                       count: HalftoneDescreener.complexValuesCount)
```

<a id="Perform-forward-2D-FFTs-on-the-image-data"></a>

### Perform forward 2D FFTs on the image data

The [transform(input:output:direction:)](vdsp/fft/transform%28input_output_direction_%29.md) function performs a forward 2D FFT on the image data, and creates the frequency-domain representation of the image.

The following code performs the FFT on the source image and the halftone sample data. After the code completes the forward FFT of the halftone sample, the [squareMagnitudes(\_:result:)](vdsp/squaremagnitudes%28__result_%29-22k5h.md) function computes the magnitudes of the complex values representing the halftone sample:

```swift
fftSetUp.transform(input: imagePixels.dspSplitComplex,
                   output: &imageFrequencyDomainPixels.dspSplitComplex,
                   direction: .forward)

fftSetUp.transform(input: halftonePixels.dspSplitComplex,
                   output: &halftoneFrequencyDomainPixels.dspSplitComplex,
                   direction: .forward)

vDSP.squareMagnitudes(halftoneFrequencyDomainPixels.dspSplitComplex,
                      result: &halftoneSampleAmplitudes)
```

<a id="Zero-the-peaks-in-the-halftone-sample-magnitude"></a>

### Zero the peaks in the halftone sample magnitude

The sample app reduces the halftone screen artifacts by manipulating the magnitude of the frequency-domain data for the halftone sample.

The [threshold(\_:to:with:)](vdsp/threshold%28__to_with_%29-77g7l.md) function sets all magnitude values that are over the threshold to -1, and all magnitude values that are less than or equal to the threshold to 1:

```swift
let outputConstant: Float = -1

vDSP.threshold(halftoneSampleAmplitudes,
               to: threshold,
               with: .signedConstant(outputConstant),
               result: &halftoneSampleAmplitudes)
```

The [clip(\_:to:result:)](vdsp/clip%28__to_result_%29-3lbii.md) function clips the values in the `halftoneSampleAmplitude`, setting all of the high-magnitude values to `0.0`, and all of the low-magnitude values to `1.0`.

```swift
vDSP.clip(halftoneSampleAmplitudes,
          to: 0 ... 1,
          result: &halftoneSampleAmplitudes)
```

<a id="Descreen-the-source-image"></a>

### Descreen the source image

The app multiplies the frequency-domain data of the source image by the values in `halftoneSampleAmplitude`, thus removing or reducing the halftone screen.

```swift
vDSP.multiply(imageFrequencyDomainPixels.dspSplitComplex,
              by: halftoneSampleAmplitudes,
              result: &imageFrequencyDomainPixels.dspSplitComplex)
```

<a id="Perform-an-inverse-2D-FFT-on-the-frequency-domain-data"></a>

### Perform an inverse 2D FFT on the frequency domain data

The [transform(input:output:direction:)](vdsp/fft/transform%28input_output_direction_%29.md) function performs an inverse FFT on the frequency-domain image data to generate the descreened spatial-domain image.

```swift
fftSetUp.transform(input: imageFrequencyDomainPixels.dspSplitComplex,
                   output: &destinationSpatialDomainPixels.dspSplitComplex,
                   direction: .inverse)
```

<a id="Generate-an-image-from-the-split-complex-vector"></a>

### Generate an image from the split-complex vector

Finally, the app creates a displayable image from the spatial-domain representation of the treated source image.

```swift
var floatPixels = [Float](fromSplitComplex: self.dspSplitComplex,
                          scale: 1 / Float(count),
                          count: count * 2)

return floatPixels.withUnsafeMutableBytes {
    let tmpBuffer = vImage_Buffer(
        data: $0.baseAddress,
        height: vImagePixelCount(HalftoneDescreener.imageHeight),
        width: vImagePixelCount(HalftoneDescreener.imageWidth),
        rowBytes: HalftoneDescreener.imageWidth * MemoryLayout<Float>.stride)
    
    return try! tmpBuffer.createCGImage(format: SplitComplex.imageFormat)
}
```

    &tmpBuffer,
    &Self.imageFormat,
    [0, 0, 0, 0],
    cgImage,
    vImage_Flags(kvImageNoAllocate))
```

The [vDSP_ctoz](vdsp_ctoz.md) function converts the interleaved pixel values to split-complex format. The function copies odd-numbered pixels to the real parts and the even-numbered pixels to the imaginary parts of each complex value.

```swift
pixelsStorage.withMemoryRebound(to: DSPComplex.self) {
    
    vDSP_ctoz([DSPComplex]($0), 2,

```

```

<a id="Perform-forward-2D-FFTs-on-the-image-data"></a>

The [transform(input:output:direction:)](vdsp/fft/transform%28input_output_direction_%29.md) function performs a forward 2D FFT on the image data, and creates the frequency-domain representation of the image.

The following code performs the FFT on the source image and the halftone sample data. After the code completes the forward FFT of the halftone sample, the [squareMagnitudes(\_:result:)](vdsp/squaremagnitudes%28__result_%29-22k5h.md) function computes the magnitudes of the complex values representing the halftone sample:

                   output: &imageFrequencyDomainPixels.dspSplitComplex,
                   direction: .forward)

fftSetUp.transform(input: halftonePixels.dspSplitComplex,
                   output: &halftoneFrequencyDomainPixels.dspSplitComplex,
                   direction: .forward)

```

<a id="Zero-the-peaks-in-the-halftone-sample-magnitude"></a>

### Zero the peaks in the halftone sample magnitude

The sample app reduces the halftone screen artifacts by manipulating the magnitude of the frequency-domain data for the halftone sample.

The [threshold(\_:to:with:)](vdsp/threshold%28__to_with_%29-77g7l.md) function sets all magnitude values that are over the threshold to -1, and all magnitude values that are less than or equal to the threshold to 1:

               with: .signedConstant(outputConstant),
               result: &halftoneSampleAmplitudes)
```

The [clip(\_:to:result:)](vdsp/clip%28__to_result_%29-3lbii.md) function clips the values in the `halftoneSampleAmplitude`, setting all of the high-magnitude values to `0.0`, and all of the low-magnitude values to `1.0`.

```swift

```

<a id="Descreen-the-source-image"></a>

### Descreen the source image

The app multiplies the frequency-domain data of the source image by the values in `halftoneSampleAmplitude`, thus removing or reducing the halftone screen.

```swift

The [transform(input:output:direction:)](vdsp/fft/transform%28input_output_direction_%29.md) function performs an inverse FFT on the frequency-domain image data to generate the descreened spatial-domain image.

```swift
fftSetUp.transform(input: imageFrequencyDomainPixels.dspSplitComplex,
                   output: &destinationSpatialDomainPixels.dspSplitComplex,
                   direction: .inverse)
