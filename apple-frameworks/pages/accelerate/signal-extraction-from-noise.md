**Interface languages:** Swift, Objective-C

Use Accelerate’s discrete cosine transform to remove noise from a signal.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

Accelerate’s vDSP module provides functions to perform discrete and fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) on 1D vectors and 2D matrices containing complex numbers. If you want to perform a similar transform on a vector of real numbers, vDSP includes discrete cosine transforms (DCTs).

FFTs and DCTs decompose a signal into its frequency components (known as the *frequency-domain* representation of the signal), and the inverse transform rebuilds a signal into its *time-domain* representation from the frequency components.

By zeroing low-magnitude data, such as noise, from the frequency-domain data, you can reconstruct a signal, leaving only its dominant frequencies. The meaningful signals that you’re trying to isolate tend to have their energy packed at a few frequencies. Noise, however, has its energy more uniformly spread across the frequency spectrum (that’s what makes it noise). If you zero out low-magnitude frequency components, you can eliminate much of the noise from the spectrum.

### Generate the test signal

The `noisySignal` array contains the noisy signal from which the sample app extracts the underlying signal. The underlying signal is a series of cosine waves that’s stored as 1024 samples in an array of single-precision values.

The `static SignalExtractor.generateSignal(noiseAmount:sampleCount:)` function generates a sample at each data point.

```swift
static func generateSignal(noiseAmount: Double,
                           sampleCount: Int) -> [Float] {
    
    let tau = Float.pi * 2
    
    return (0 ..< sampleCount).map { i in
        let phase = Float(i) / Float(sampleCount) * tau
        
        var signal = cos(phase * 1) * 1.0
            signal += cos(phase * 2) * 0.8
            signal += cos(phase * 4) * 0.4
            signal += cos(phase * 8) * 0.8
            signal += cos(phase * 16) * 1.0
            signal += cos(phase * 32) * 0.8
        
        return signal + .random(in: -1...1) * Float(noiseAmount)
    }
}
```

When the `noiseAmount` parameter is zero, the values that this code generates return a signal like the one in the image below:

Adding noise to the signal makes it unrecognizable.

### Prepare the DCT setups

The sample app creates setup objects that contain all the information required to perform the forward and inverse DCT operations. Because creating these setup objects can be expensive, the sample app creates the DCT setup objects once and reuses them.

The forward transform is a type II DCT.

```swift
static let forwardDCTSetup = vDSP.DCT(count: sampleCount,
                               transformType: vDSP.DCTTransformType.II)!
```

The inverse transform is a type III DCT.

```swift
static let inverseDCTSetup = vDSP.DCT(count: sampleCount,
                               transformType: vDSP.DCTTransformType.III)!
```

<a id="Perform-the-DCT"></a>

### Perform the DCT

The [transform(\_:)](vdsp/dct/transform%28__%29.md) function performs the DCT. This function requires a source array that contains the source signal and a destination array that the function overwrites with the frequency-domain data.

```swift
forwardDCTSetup.transform(noisySignal,
                          result: &frequencyDomainDestination)
```

The following visualization of the frequency-domain data shows the component cosine parts. The `cos(phase * 1) * 1.0` component is on the left, and  `cos(phase * 16) * 1.0` is on the right:

The frequency-domain visualization of the noisy signal shows the dominant frequencies with the noise spread evenly throughout the frequency range. The sample zeroes the low-magnitude data to generate the noise-free signal.

<a id="Apply-a-threshold-to-the-frequency-domain-data"></a>

### Apply a threshold to the frequency-domain data

Remove the noise from the signal by zeroing all values in the frequency-domain data that are below a specified threshold.

The [threshold(\_:to:with:result:)](vdsp/threshold%28__to_with_result_%29-45b58.md) function sets all values in the frequency-domain array that fall below the threshold to zero.

```swift
vDSP.threshold(frequencyDomainDestination,
               to: Float(threshold),
               with: .zeroFill,
               result: &frequencyDomainDestination)

```

<a id="Recreate-the-signal"></a>

### Recreate the signal

The inverse DCT generates a new signal using the cleaned-up frequency-domain data:

```swift
inverseDCTSetup.transform(frequencyDomainDestination,
                          result: &timeDomainDestination)

```

The sample app scales the inverse DCT so that it matches the magnitude of the original signal. The scaling factor for the forward transform is 2, and the scaling factor for the inverse transform is the number of samples (in this case, 1024). The [divide(\_:\_:)](vdsp/divide%28____%29-8swnm.md) function divides the inverse DCT result by `count / 2` to return a signal with the correct magnitude.

```swift
let divisor = Float(Self.sampleCount / 2)

vDSP.divide(timeDomainDestination,
            divisor,
            result: &timeDomainDestination)

```
