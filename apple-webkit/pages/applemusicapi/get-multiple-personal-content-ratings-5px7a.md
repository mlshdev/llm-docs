## Discussion

This endpoint requires a music user token. For more information, see [User Authentication for MusicKit](user-authentication-for-musickit.md).

A rating indicates whether a user likes `(1)` or dislikes `(-1)` the album. These are the only two ratings supported.

For a particular album, the personal ratings for that album’s catalog ID and library ID (if the album is in the library) stay synced.
