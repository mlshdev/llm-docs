## Discussion

This endpoint requires a music user token. For more information, see [User Authentication for MusicKit](user-authentication-for-musickit.md).

A rating indicates whether a user likes `(1)` or dislikes `(-1)` the song. These are the only two ratings supported.

For a particular song, the personal ratings for that song’s catalog ID and library ID (if the song is in the library) stay synced.
