Returns the result of rotating this matrix by a given vector and angle.

## Declaration

```
WebKitCSSMatrix rotateAxisAngle(
    optional unrestricted double x, 
    optional unrestricted double y, 
    optional unrestricted double z, 
    optional unrestricted double angle
);
```

## Parameters

- `x`: The x component in the vector, in degrees.
- `y`: The y component in the vector, in degrees. If undefined, the x component is used.
