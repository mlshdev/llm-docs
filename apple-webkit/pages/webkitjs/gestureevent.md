## Overview

`GestureEvent` objects are high-level events that encapsulate the low-level [TouchEvent](touchevent.md) objects. Both `GestureEvent` and `TouchEvent` events are sent during a multi-touch sequence. Gesture events contain scaling and rotation information allowing gestures to be combined, if supported by the platform. If not supported, one gesture ends before another starts. Listen for `GestureEvent` events if you want to respond to gestures only, not process the low-level `TouchEvent` objects.

The different types of `GestureEvent` objects that can occur are:

- **`gesturestart`**: Sent when two or more fingers touch the surface.
- **`gesturechange`**: Sent when fingers are moved during a gesture.
- **`gestureend`**: Sent when the gesture ends (when there are 1 or 0 fingers touching the surface).

For example, for a two finger multi-touch gesture, the events occur in the following sequence:

1. `touchstart` for finger 1. Sent when the first finger touches the surface.
2. `gesturestart`. Sent when the second finger touches the surface.
3. `touchstart` for finger 2. Sent immediately after `gesturestart` when the second finger touches the surface.
4. `gesturechange` for current gesture. Sent when both fingers move while still touching the surface.
5. `gestureend`. Sent when the second finger lifts from the surface.
6. `touchend` for finger 2. Sent immediately after `gestureend` when the second finger lifts from the surface.
7. `touchend` for finger 1. Sent when the first finger lifts from the surface.

See [TouchEvent](touchevent.md) if you want to process just low-level `TouchEvent` objects.
