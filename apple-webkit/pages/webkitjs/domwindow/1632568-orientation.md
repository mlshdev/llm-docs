## Discussion

This property is set to one of the values in [Table 1](1632568-orientation.md#1965650). For example, if the user starts with the device in portrait orientation and then changes to landscape orientation by turning the device to the right, the window’s `orientation` property is set to `-90`. If the user instead changes to landscape by turning the device to the left, the window’s `orientation` property is set to `90`. The default value is `0`.

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | Portrait orientation. This is the default value. |
| `-90` | Landscape orientation with the screen turned clockwise. |
| `90` | Landscape orientation with the screen turned counterclockwise. |
| `180` | Portrait orientation with the screen turned upside down. This value is currently not supported on iPhone. |
