# setUpAuth

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** CloudKit JS  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** CloudKit JS 1.0+

Determines whether a user is signed in and presents an appropriate sign in or sign out button.

## Declaration

```
Promise<CloudKit.UserIdentity, CloudKit.CKError> setUpAuth();
```

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

A `Promise` that resolves to a [CloudKit.UserIdentity](../cloudkit.useridentity.md) dictionary if an active CloudKit session was found; otherwise, `null`. If an error occurs, a `Promise` object that rejects to a [CKError](../cloudkit/ckerror.md) object.

## Discussion

Use the [setUpAuth](setupauth.md) method to determine whether the user is authenticated and to display the appropriate button.

```javascript
var myContainer = CloudKit.getDefaultContainer();
 
myContainer.setUpAuth().then(function(userIdentity) {
    if(userIdentity) {
        // The user is authenticated
    }
});
```

In the function, use the `userRecordName` property to get the user record name from the [CloudKit.UserIdentity](../cloudkit.useridentity.md) parameter.

The [setUpAuth](setupauth.md) method displays the appropriate buttons only if the required DOM elements are found. If the user is not signed in, the method displays a sign-in button; otherwise, it displays a sign-out button.

You can call this method multiple times. For example, call this method to determine if a previous CloudKit session is still valid, and call this method later to display the buttons after you add the required DOM elements.
