## Discussion

If the promise is successful, it will resolve with one of the following dictionaries:

- `{ statusCode: 200; result: CKDBResolveRecordResponse }`

The promise may reject and throw the following:

- `DocumentedResponseError`, if the HTTP status code is 421. The result member will be a dictionary conforming to AuthenticationRequiredError.
- `DocumentedResponseError`, if the HTTP status code is none of the above and in the range 400 to 599. The result member will be a dictionary conforming to RequestError.
- `ValidationError`, if the parameters to the method are incorrect.
- A `FetchError` descendant, if there is a problem with the network request. A reference to the request object can be used to examine the underlying cause.

## Discussion

The `params` dictionary has the following properties:

```javascript
dictionary ResolveRecordParams {
  string containerId;
  CKEnvironment environment;
  string shortGuid;
  CKDBResolveRecordRequestBody? body;
}
```

- `containerId`: The container identifier. See `Container`.
- `environment`: The container environment. For valid values, see `CKEnvironment`.
- `shortGuid`: A global unique identifier for this record used for sharing. See `createRecord` for information on retrieving this identifier.
- `body`: Configuration options for how the resolved record is returned.

If successful, the response contains a `CKDBResolveRecordResponse` object with the resolved record.
