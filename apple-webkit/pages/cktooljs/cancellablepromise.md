## Overview

This class wraps an ordinary promise, but also provides a method that can be used to cancel the promise. The `cancel` function throws `CancelledError` if called.

API object methods return a promise of this type. For example, `PromisesApi` has a `createRecord` method that returns a `CancellablePromise`.
