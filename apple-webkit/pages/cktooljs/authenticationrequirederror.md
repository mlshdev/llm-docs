## Overview

Some database operations require that users sign in with their Apple ID. The server returns `AuthenticationRequiredError` when the user isn’t signed in or their session has expired.

In JavaScript, this is a plain object with properties as described.

In TypeScript, this type is imported in the following way:

```javascript
import type { AuthenticationRequiredError } from "@apple/cktool.database";
```
