## Overview

A zone is a logical separation of records within a single database. Features are often associated with an entire zone. For example, a zone may be optionally shared from one user to another.

In JavaScript, this is a plain object with properties as described.

In TypeScript, this type is imported in the following way:

```javascript
import type { CKDBZone } from "@apple/cktool.database";
```
