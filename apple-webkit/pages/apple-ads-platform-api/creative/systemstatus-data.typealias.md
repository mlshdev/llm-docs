# Creative.SystemStatus

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** Apple Ads Platform API  
**Kind:** Type  
**Availability:** Apple Ads Platform API 1.0+

System validation status reflecting whether the ad creative can serve.

## Declaration

```
string Creative.SystemStatus
```

## Possible Values

- `VALID`: The ad creative has passed all system validation checks and is ready to serve. The ad creative may still be subject to additional review.
- `INVALID`: The ad creative has failed one or more validation checks. Check `systemStatusReasons` for the cause.
- `PENDING`: The ad creative is undergoing system validation, policy determination, or waiting for asset CDN availability.

## Discussion

A `VALID` result only confirms system checks passed; Apple’s additional creative review can still affect whether the ad creative ultimately serves.
