## Discussion

Empty for Product Page ad creatives (`CUSTOM_PRODUCT_PAGE`, `DEFAULT_PRODUCT_PAGE`) since pre-tap content isn’t customizable for these types. For `LOCAL_ADS_SEARCH_CREATIVE`, `creativeSpec` carries the Apple Maps ad creative spec:

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `brandId` | String | Brand identifier for the ad creative on Apple Maps. |
| `creativeSubtype` | Enum (`BUSINESS_LOGO`, `BUSINESS_ASSET`) | Sub-type classification for the creative. |
| `creativeAssets` | Array of asset references | Ordered list of asset references for this creative, each identified by `assetId`. |
| `localizedText` | Map of locale to map of text key to string | Localized ad copy by locale key, then by text key (for example, `headline`, `body`). |
| `defaultLocale` | String | Default locale used alongside `localizedText`. |

See [CreativeCreate.CreativeSpec](../creativecreate/creativespec-data.dictionary.md) for a create-time example.
