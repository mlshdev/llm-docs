### Configure a Keyword

A keyword belongs to an ad group and associates a search term with a bid. When a user’s search query matches a keyword, the ad group becomes eligible to enter the auction for that query.

Each keyword requires:

- `text`: The keyword term to target. For `CATEGORY` match type on Maps campaigns, this must be a Maps business category identifier (for example, `dining.restaurant`).
- `matchType`: How the keyword matches user queries. The `EXACT` and `BROAD` types apply to App Store campaigns using the Search results placement. The `PHRASE` and `CATEGORY` types apply to Apple Maps campaigns. See [KeywordMatchType](keywordmatchtype.md).
- `adGroupId`: The ad group this keyword belongs to.

The `bid` field is optional on create. When provided, it overrides the ad group’s [BidStrategy](bidstrategy.md) `bid` for that specific keyword. Maximize Conversions bid strategy campaigns don’t use the `bid` field.

To enable or pause individual keywords without removing them, use [KeywordStatus](keywordstatus.md). A paused keyword remains in the ad group but doesn’t participate in auctions.

### Configure a Negative Keyword

A negative keyword prevents your ad from serving when a user’s search matches the excluded term. You can scope negative keywords to either a campaign or an ad group:

- **Campaign-level**: Applies across all ad groups in the campaign. Set `campaignId` and omit `adGroupId`.
- **Ad group-level**: Applies only within a specific ad group. Set `adGroupId` and omit `campaignId`.

Negative keywords use the same `text` and `matchType` fields as keywords but don’t have a `bid` field, though `CATEGORY` match type doesn’t apply to negative keywords.

### Choose a Match Type

The `matchType` field controls how a keyword’s text matches a user’s search query. See the table below for each type’s placement and behavior:

| Match Type | Placement | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BROAD` | App Store (Search results) | Matches the keyword and close variants, including misspellings, synonyms, and related terms. Maximizes reach. |
| `EXACT` | App Store (Search results) | Matches the keyword term precisely. Gives the most control over which queries trigger the ad. |
| `PHRASE` | Maps | Matches the keyword and close variants within Maps search, allowing flexibility while staying focused on the search intent. |
| `CATEGORY` | Maps | Matches user searches to a Maps business category (for example, `dining.restaurant`, `shopping.clothing`). Use category identifiers from the [Query Business Categories](query-categories.md) endpoint. |

Use `BROAD` as the recommended starting point for Search results campaigns on the App Store when you’re building out a keyword list. To control spend on specific high-value terms, use `EXACT`. For Maps campaigns, use `CATEGORY` to reach users searching for a type of business rather than a specific name.
