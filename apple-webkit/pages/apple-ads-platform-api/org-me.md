## Overview

This group exposes the following endpoints:

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/v1/me` | [Get Me Details](get-current-user-details.md) returns a `MeResponse` with the `userId` and `orgId` bound to the authenticated caller’s access token. |
| `GET` | `/v1/acls` | [Get User ACL](get-user-acls.md) returns a list of `UserAcl` entries identifying every ad account the token can access and the role assigned to each. |
| `GET` | `/v1/orgs/{id}` | [Get Org by ID](get-orgs-_id_.md) returns an `OrgResponse` with the organization’s name, currency, timezone, payment model, and system status. |

Call `GET /v1/me` ([Get Me Details](get-current-user-details.md)), `GET /v1/acls` ([Get User ACL](get-user-acls.md)), and `GET /v1/orgs/{id}` ([Get Org by ID](get-orgs-_id_.md)) in that order to confirm identity and discover accessible ad accounts. The `GET /v1/acls` ([Get User ACL](get-user-acls.md)) endpoint is the recommended starting point for determining which ad accounts a token can manage.

> **Note**

> The `GET /v1/me` ([Get Me Details](get-current-user-details.md)), `GET /v1/acls` ([Get User ACL](get-user-acls.md)), and `GET /v1/orgs/{id}` ([Get Org by ID](get-orgs-_id_.md)) endpoints don’t require the `X-AP-Context` header. Supply `X-AP-Context` only for ad-account-scoped operations.
