## Discussion

This endpoint retrieves a single App Store product page (DPP, CPP, or PPO) by its unique UUID. You create and manage product pages in App Store Connect. This endpoint reads the product page state as it appears to the Apple Ads Platform API.

The `state` field is a plain string reflecting the product page’s current distribution status, and it is not a closed enum. The typical value once a page is live is `PUBLISHED`, though App Store Connect may surface other states (such as `READY_FOR_DISTRIBUTION`) before a page finishes propagating.

The `deepLink` field provides the URL used when the product page is set as a creative destination. The response also includes the product page `name`, the associated `adamId` of the app, and `creationTime` and `modificationTime` timestamps.

Keep the following constraints in mind when fetching a product page:

| Constraint | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| UUID format | `productPageId` is a UUID assigned by App Store Connect. It is not an integer. |
| Discovery | Use [Query Product Pages](query-product-pages.md) to list all product pages for an app by `adamId` before fetching by ID. |
