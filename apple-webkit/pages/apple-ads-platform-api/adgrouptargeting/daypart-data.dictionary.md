## Discussion

Used with App Store and Apple Maps campaigns. Uses the [TargetingData](../targetingdata.md) `include`/`exclude` shape.

| Day | Slot Range | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sunday | 0–23 | 0 = Sunday 12:00 AM, 1 = Sunday 1:00 AM |
| Monday | 24–47 | 24 = Monday 12:00 AM |
| Tuesday | 48–71 | 48 = Tuesday 12:00 AM |
| Wednesday | 72–95 | 72 = Wednesday 12:00 AM |
| Thursday | 96–119 | 96 = Thursday 12:00 AM |
| Friday | 120–143 | 120 = Friday 12:00 AM |
| Saturday | 144–167 | 144 = Saturday 12:00 AM |

To convert any slot value: divide by 24 to get the day index (0 = Sunday), and take the remainder to get the hour. Slot values are evaluated in the ad account’s configured time zone.
