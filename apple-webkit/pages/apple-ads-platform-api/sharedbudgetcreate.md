## Discussion

The `SharedBudgetCreate` object is the request payload for creating a new budget order.

Ensure the `currency` in the `Money` object matches the ad account’s currency. Once created, you can assign the budget order to one or more campaigns using `SharedBudgetAssignment` on each campaign.
