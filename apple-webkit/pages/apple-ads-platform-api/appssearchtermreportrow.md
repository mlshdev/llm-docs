# AppsSearchTermReportRow

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** Apple Ads Platform API  
**Kind:** Object  
**Availability:** Apple Ads Platform API 1.0+

A single row in an Apps search term report, pairing search-term metadata with total and granular performance metrics.

## Declaration

```
object AppsSearchTermReportRow
```

## Properties

- `totalMetrics` — `AppsMetrics`: See [AppsMetrics](appsmetrics.md) for details.
- `granularMetrics` — `[AppsMetrics]`: Time-series metrics broken down by the requested granularity (for example, `DAILY`, `WEEKLY`). Present only when a `granularity` is specified in the request. When it isn’t, this field is absent and all data appears in `totalMetrics` instead.
- `metadata` — `ReportingSearchTerm`: See [ReportingSearchTerm](reportingsearchterm.md) for details.

## Discussion

The `metadata` field captures the search term text and its associated keyword and ad group context at report time. The `totalMetrics` field contains the aggregated performance figures across the full reporting period.
