## Discussion

Each `ImpressionShareRow` represents one combination of date, search term, and country or region in an impression share report. The date field present depends on the granularity chosen in [ImpressionShareTimeRange](impressionsharetimerange.md): `day` for `DAILY` granularity, `week` for `WEEKLY_SUN_SAT` granularity.

### Impression share encoding

The `lowImpressionShare` and `highImpressionShare` fields use a tiered encoding:

| Impression share | `lowImpressionShare` | `highImpressionShare` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0% | `0` | `0` |
| 1% – 90% | `x` (for example, `0.23`) | `x` (same value) |
| 91% – 100% | `0.91` | `1` |

When both fields are equal and less than `0.91`, the value is a precise single-digit percentage. When `highImpressionShare` is `1`, the app holds more than 90% impression share for that term.

### Example

```json
{
  "day": "2025-01-10",
  "appName": "AwayFinder",
  "promotedObjectId": "123456789",
  "countryOrRegion": "US",
  "searchTerm": "travel planner",
  "lowImpressionShare": 0.23,
  "highImpressionShare": 0.23,
  "rank": 1,
  "searchPopularity1to5": 4
}
```
