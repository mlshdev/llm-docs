## Discussion

Each `SearchTermPopularityRow` represents one combination of time period, country or region, genre, and search term in a search term popularity report. The date field present depends on the granularity in [SearchTermPopularityTimeRange](searchtermpopularitytimerange.md): `week` for `WEEKLY_SUN_SAT`, `month` for `MONTHLY`.
