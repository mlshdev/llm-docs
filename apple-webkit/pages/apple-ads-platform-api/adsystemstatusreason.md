## Discussion

One or more `AdSystemStatusReason` values appear in the `systemStatusReasons` array on an [Ad](ad.md) when `systemStatus` is `NOT_RUNNING`. These codes are read-only and system-applied. They provide the specific cause behind a non-running state and indicate what action, if any, is required to resume delivery.
