## Discussion

A SharedBudget creates a spending cap across a group of campaigns within an ad account. Campaigns participating in the same SharedBudget draw from a common spend limit. The `startTime` and `endTime` fields define the active window.

The `systemStatus` field reflects whether the budget is currently usable. Common blocking reasons in `systemStatusReasons` include `EXHAUSTED` and `SCHEDULE_PENDING`.
