## Overview

Use the Search Apps API to query localized app metadata, find the `adamId` that becomes the `promotedObjectId` on your campaign, and verify `availableStorefronts` before setting campaign target App Store countries or regions.

You can only create campaigns for apps that you own in your ad account. Searching the App Store catalog returns metadata for any public app, but the `adamId` you use as `promotedObjectId` must belong to an app you own. To search only the apps your organization owns, use the `returnOwnedApps` parameter on [Search for Apps](searches-for-a-list-of-apps.md).

Confirm an app is eligible to advertise with [App Eligibility Endpoints](app-eligibility-endpoints.md) before building a campaign around it, and use [Product Pages Endpoints](product-pages-endpoints.md) to discover its product pages for a creative once it’s eligible.

## Explore the Available Endpoints

The Search Apps API provides three endpoints for finding, validating, and describing apps:

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/v1/search/apps` | Searches the App Store for apps by name, content provider, or returns apps owned by your organization. See [Search for Apps](searches-for-a-list-of-apps.md). |
| `GET` | `/v1/apps/{adamId}` | Retrieves details for a single app by its Adam ID. See [Get App Details by Adam ID](get-app-details-by-adam-id.md). |
| `POST` | `/v1/metadata/apps/supported-languages/query` | Returns the languages supported for app advertising in each country or region. See [Query Supported App Languages](query-supported-app-languages.md). |

To retrieve the default product page’s localized metadata for an Adam ID, see [Query App Locale Details](query-default-product-page-locale-details-by-adam-id.md) under [Product Pages Endpoints](product-pages-endpoints.md).

Retrieving a single app by Adam ID returns an `AppDetails` object with the following fields:
