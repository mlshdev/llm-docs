## Discussion

This endpoint retrieves a single ad by its ID. The response includes `systemStatus`, `displayStatus`, `systemStatusReasons`, and `systemStatusLimitingReasons`. To diagnose why an ad may not be delivering, use these fields together. See [Ads Endpoints](ads-endpoints.md) for the full status field semantics.

The `displayStatus` field resolves to one of the following values:

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `RUNNING` | The ad is actively serving impressions. |
| `PAUSED` | The advertiser paused the ad at the ad level (`status: PAUSED`). |
| `ON_HOLD` | The ad is on hold due to an ad-level condition. |
| `AD_GROUP_ON_HOLD` | The parent ad group is on hold. |
| `CAMPAIGN_ON_HOLD` | The parent campaign is on hold. |
| `LIMITED` | The ad is serving, but one or more factors restrict delivery. |
| `PROCESSING` | The system is processing the ad, or Apple is reviewing its ad creative. |
| `DELETED` | The advertiser deleted the ad. |

When `systemStatus` is `NOT_RUNNING`, check the following causes:

| Cause | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Creative pending review | Apple has not yet approved the ad creative associated with this ad. `displayStatus` is `PROCESSING`. |
| Creative rejected | Apple rejected the ad creative (`INVALID`). The ad will not serve until the advertiser associates a new ad creative via a new ad. |
| Ad paused | `status: PAUSED` on the ad itself. |
| Ad group paused | The advertiser has paused the parent ad group, or the system has put it on hold. |
| Campaign paused | The advertiser has paused the parent campaign, or the system has put it on hold. |

Keep the following constraints in mind when reading a GET response:

| Constraint | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Deleted ads are returned | The system still returns a deleted ad with `deleted: true`. It does not remove the record from GET by ID responses. |
| Use `systemStatusReasons` for diagnostics | The `systemStatusReasons` array identifies specific causes when `systemStatus` is `NOT_RUNNING`. |
| `creativeId` and `adGroupId` are read-only | These fields are immutable. The system sets them at creation and returns them on every GET response. |
| To list all ads, use the query endpoint | `GET /v1/ads/{id}` returns a single record. To list or filter multiple ads, use `POST /v1/ads/query`. |
