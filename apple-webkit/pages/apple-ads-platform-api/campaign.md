## Discussion

A `Campaign` is the top-level advertising container that defines the promoted object, billing model, scheduling, and geographic targeting for a set of ad groups. Each campaign belongs to a single ad account and promotes either an App Store app (`APPSTORE_APP`) or a brand (`BUSINESS_BRAND`). The `billingEvent`, `promotedObjectType`, and `promotedObjectId` fields stay fixed after creation. To change any of them, create a new campaign.

The `status` field captures the advertiser’s intent for the campaign to serve. The `systemStatus` field reflects Apple’s system assessment of whether the campaign can deliver. When `systemStatus` isn’t `RUNNING`, inspect `systemStatusReasons` to identify blocking conditions and `systemStatusLimitingReasons` for delivery-reducing (but non-blocking) factors.

A required `dailyBudget` cap controls the campaign’s budget and limits daily spending. You can also assign a campaign to one or more shared budgets via `sharedBudgets`. The two budget controls function independently: `dailyBudget` enforces a daily cap. Each shared budget enforces a flight-period cap defined by its `startTime` and `endTime`.

Fields you can filter and sort on when querying campaigns are listed in [Query Campaigns](post-campaigns-query.md). For the complete list of required and optional fields at creation, see [CampaignCreate](campaigncreate.md). For the fields that you can change after creation, see [CampaignUpdate](campaignupdate.md).
