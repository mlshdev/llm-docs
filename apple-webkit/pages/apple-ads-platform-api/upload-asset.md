## Discussion

This endpoint uploads a raw image file and associates it with a promoted object (Brand). The multipart request body must include the binary image file alongside `promotedObjectId` and `promotedObjectType` fields that identify the brand the asset belongs to.

**This endpoint currently supports Business Brand assets only.** `promotedObjectType` accepts only `BUSINESS_BRAND`, so uploaded assets serve ads on Apple Maps. App Store app assets aren’t supported here: App Store creatives use `CUSTOM_PRODUCT_PAGE` or `DEFAULT_PRODUCT_PAGE`, which reference an app’s existing App Store product page instead of an uploaded image.

After upload, the asset begins processing. Poll using [Get Asset](get-asset-by-id.md) until the `eligibility.status` indicates the asset is ready before referencing it in a creative.

The returned asset has `assetType: IMAGE` and a `providerAssetId` that the provider system assigns.

## Request Body

Multipart form data (`multipart/form-data`) containing the binary image file and promoted-object metadata.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `file` | binary | Yes | The image file to upload. Accepted formats: PNG, JPG, HEIC. |
| `promotedObjectId` | string | Yes | The identifier of the promoted object (for example, the brand ID for a `BUSINESS_BRAND`). |
| `promotedObjectType` | string | Yes | The type of the promoted object. Only `BUSINESS_BRAND` is supported; App Store apps aren’t supported by this endpoint. |

### Post-Upload Workflow

1. Poll `GET /v1/assets/{id}` ([Get Asset](get-asset-by-id.md)) until `eligibility.status` indicates the asset is ready to use.
2. Reference the asset UUID in a `creativeAssets` array when creating a `LOCAL_ADS_SEARCH_CREATIVE`.
