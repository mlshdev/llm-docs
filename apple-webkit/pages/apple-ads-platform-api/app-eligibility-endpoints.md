## Overview

Not every app is eligible for promotion. Apple evaluates each app against a set of policy and technical criteria before it can serve ads, at a per-placement, per-country level of granularity. Each `EligibilityResponse` row reports a `state` of `ELIGIBLE` or `INELIGIBLE` for a given `adamId`, `supplyPlacement`, `supplySource`, `countryOrRegion`, and `deviceClass`, along with the `minAge` rating required in that market. To retrieve human-readable descriptions of any policy violations returned during ad creative review of App Store ad creatives, use the rejection reasons endpoints on this page.

This eligibility check applies to App Store app promotion (`promotedObjectType: APPSTORE_APP`) only. Apple Maps brand promotion (`promotedObjectType: BUSINESS_BRAND`) doesn’t use a dedicated eligibility query. Instead, the `eligibility` field on the [Brand](brand.md), [Location](location.md), [BusinessCategory](businesscategory.md), and [LocationGroup](locationgroup.md) objects reports serving eligibility directly, described in [Eligibility](eligibility.md). Apple Maps ad creative rejection reasons are also queried separately, with [Query Rejection Reasons for Brands](query-policy-assignments-%28rejection-reasons%29-for-external-consumers.md).

Use [Search Apps Endpoints](search-apps-endpoints.md) to find an app’s `adamId` and full app details, including via [Get App Details by Adam ID](get-app-details-by-adam-id.md), to check its eligibility. Once an app is eligible, use [Product Pages Endpoints](product-pages-endpoints.md) to discover its product pages to reference in an ad creative.
