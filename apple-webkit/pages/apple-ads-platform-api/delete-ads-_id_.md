## Discussion

This endpoint soft-deletes an ad by its ID. The system marks the ad `deleted: true`, and it immediately stops serving. The system preserves the record and excludes it from query results by default, but a GET request still returns the ad with `deleted: true`. A subsequent PUT request to update a deleted ad returns 404 Not Found.

Deleting an ad doesn’t affect the associated ad creative. The ad creative remains available, and new ads in any ad group can reference it. Deleting an ad doesn’t affect delivery of other ads in the same ad group that reference the same or different ad creatives.

To change which ad creative an ad group serves, delete the existing ad and create a new ad with the desired `creativeId` in the same ad group.

Deleting an ad has the following effects:

| Constraint | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Soft delete only | The system marks the ad `deleted: true` but does not physically remove it. It retains the record for audit purposes. |
| Delivery stops immediately | The deleted ad stops serving as soon as the system processes the delete. |
| Deleted ads return from GET | GET requests after deletion return the ad with `deleted: true`, not a 404. |
| PUT returns 404 after deletion | Attempting to update a deleted ad returns 404 Not Found. |
| Deleted ads excluded from queries | `POST /v1/ads/query` excludes deleted ads by default. Filter with `deleted EQUALS true` to confirm deletion. |
| Associated ad creative is not deleted | The ad creative record is unaffected. Other ads can use it. |
| To swap an ad creative | Delete this ad and create a new ad with the desired `creativeId` in the same ad group. |
