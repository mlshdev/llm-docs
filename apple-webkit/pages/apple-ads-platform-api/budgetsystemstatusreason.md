## Discussion

One or more `BudgetSystemStatusReason` values appear in the `systemStatusReasons` array on a budget or budget order. These codes are read-only and system-applied. They update automatically as conditions change. Use them to diagnose why a budget is `INACTIVE` and determine what action, if any, is required.
