## Discussion

Ad group reports return one row per ad group. Each row contains a `metadata` object with ad group identifiers (including `campaignId`), `totalMetrics` aggregated over the full date range, and a `granularMetrics` array broken down by the selected `granularity`.

Filter by the required `campaignId` in the `filters` array, optionally narrowed further by `adGroupId`. Use `groupBy` to split metrics along a dimension: each dimension value produces its own row within the ad group’s result.

See [Filter](filter.md) for the full set of supported comparison operators.

## Request Body

See [AppsReportingRequest](appsreportingrequest.md).

<a id="groupBy-Dimensions"></a>

### groupBy Dimensions

`deviceClass`, `ageRange`, `gender`, `countryCode`, `adminArea`, `locality`, `countryOrRegion`

Date range requirements vary by granularity: `HOURLY` and `DAILY` are capped at 7-day and 90-day spans respectively, while `WEEKLY` and `MONTHLY` require spans of at least 14 and 90 days respectively.

| Granularity | Constraint |
| --- | --- |
| `DAILY` | Date range must span 90 days or less. |
| `HOURLY` | Date range must span 7 days or less, and the start date must be within the last 365 days. |
| `WEEKLY` | Date range must span at least 14 days. |
| `MONTHLY` | Date range must span at least 90 days. |

To request a single day of data, omit `granularity` entirely. For a single-day request, the response returns results in `totalMetrics` only, since there is no `granularMetrics` breakdown to compute.

Selecting a timezone of `ORTZ` or `UTC` and narrowing the `fields` array also help keep ad group report responses manageable.

| Constraint | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Filter by `campaignId` | Required to scope results and reduce response size. |
| Timezone | Use `ORTZ` (reporting timezone) or `UTC`. |
| Fields selection | Use the `fields` array to request only specific metric columns. |
