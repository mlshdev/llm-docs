## Discussion

The `CampaignUpdate` object is the request payload for modifying an existing campaign. Only the fields listed here can be changed after creation. Immutable fields such as `billingEvent`, `promotedObjectType`, and `promotedObjectId` aren’t present. Include only the fields you want to modify.

Both `dailyBudget` and `sharedBudgets` can be present on a campaign and function independently: `dailyBudget` caps daily spending. Each shared budget enforces a flight-period cap defined by its `startTime` and `endTime`.

To pause (`PAUSED`) or resume (`ENABLED`) delivery without deleting the campaign, use `status`.
