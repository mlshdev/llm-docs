## Discussion

This endpoint deletes a campaign by its ID. The campaign is soft-deleted: it’s marked with `deleted: true` and excluded from query results by default, but the record and all its fields are preserved.

After deletion, the query API will no longer include the deleted campaign by default. To retrieve deleted campaigns via the query API, pass an explicit filter with `deleted IN [true, false]`. To confirm deletion, use `GET /v1/campaigns/{id}` ([Get a Campaign](get-campaigns-_id_.md)) and verify that `Campaign.deleted` is `true`. You can also check that `systemStatus` is `NOT_RUNNING` and that `systemStatusReasons` contains `DELETED_BY_USER`.

Keep the following in mind when relying on this endpoint’s soft-delete behavior:

| Constraint | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Soft delete only | The campaign is marked `deleted: true` but not physically removed. The record is retained. |
| Deleted campaigns excluded from queries by default | `POST /v1/campaigns/query` results automatically exclude campaigns with `deleted: true` unless explicitly filtered. |
| Active ad groups are also deleted | Deleting a campaign cascades to its associated ad groups, keywords, and ads. |
