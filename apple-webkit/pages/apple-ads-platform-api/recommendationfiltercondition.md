# FilterCondition

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** Apple Ads Platform API  
**Kind:** Object  
**Availability:** Apple Ads Platform API 1.0+

A single filter condition used in a recommendation query request to narrow results.

## Declaration

```
object RecommendationFilterCondition
```

## Properties

- `field` — `string` (required): The name of the field to filter on. Must match a field name on the recommendation object being queried, for example `state`, `promotedObjectId`, `campaignId`.
- `operator` — `RecommendationFilterOperator` (required): The comparison operator to apply. See [FilterOperator](recommendationfilteroperator.md).
- `value` — `[string]` (required): An array of one or more filter values. Always supplied as an array, even when filtering with a single value, for example `value: [AVAILABLE]`.
- `ignoreCase` — `boolean`: When `true`, string matching is case-insensitive. Defaults to `false`.
  **Default:** `false`

## Discussion

The `FilterCondition` object is the building block of query filters in the Recommendations API. The API combines multiple conditions in the `filters` array with AND logic. All conditions must match for a recommendation to appear in results.

Every query request requires two filters:

| Field | Operator | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `promotedObjectId` | `EQUALS` | The ID of the promoted object. Interpreted in combination with `promotedObjectType`. |
| `promotedObjectType` | `EQUALS` | The type of promoted object, for example `APPSTORE_APP`. |

Which operators are valid for a given `field` depends on that field’s underlying type.

| Field Type | Supported Operators |
| --- | --- |
| String | `EQUALS`, `NOT_EQUALS`, `IN`, `STARTS_WITH`, `ENDS_WITH`, `LIKE` |
| Numeric | `EQUALS`, `NOT_EQUALS`, `IN`, `GREATER_THAN`, `GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL_TO`, `LESS_THAN`, `LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL_TO`, `BETWEEN` |
| Date | `EQUALS`, `NOT_EQUALS`, `GREATER_THAN`, `GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL_TO`, `LESS_THAN`, `LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL_TO` |
| Enum | `EQUALS`, `NOT_EQUALS`, `IN` |
| List | `CONTAINS_ANY`, `CONTAINS_ALL` |

Always pass `value` as an array.
