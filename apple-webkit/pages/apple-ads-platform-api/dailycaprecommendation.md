## Discussion

When a campaign frequently exhausts its daily budget, `DailyCapRecommendation` provides a system-calculated `suggestedDailyBudgetAmount` to unlock constrained growth. The `expectedInstalls`, `expectedSpend`, and `expectedCpa` fields provide projected seven-day performance estimates. Recommendations expire (`expirationTime`) and transition to `APPLIED` or `DISMISSED` once actioned.
