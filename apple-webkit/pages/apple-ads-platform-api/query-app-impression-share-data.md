## Discussion

This endpoint measures impression share: what fraction of available impressions your app captures for a given search term and country. To identify competitive gaps, use this data. A low impression share on a high-volume term indicates that either budget, bid, or eligibility constraints are limiting your reach.

See [Filter](filter.md) for the full set of supported comparison operators.

### Output Types

Configure the output type via `options.impressionShareReportType`:

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `FIRST_SLOT` | Measures impression share for the first ad position only. |
| `ALL_SLOTS` | Measures impression share across all ad positions. |

Each row in the response carries the following fields.

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `day` | Date (`YYYY-MM-DD`). Present when granularity is `DAILY`. |
| `week` | Week start date, Sunday (`YYYY-MM-DD`). Present when granularity is `WEEKLY_SUN_SAT`. |
| `appName` | Display name of the promoted app. |
| `promotedObjectId` | Adam ID of the promoted app. |
| `countryOrRegion` | ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country or region code. |
| `searchTerm` | The search term. Terms with fewer than 10 impressions in the period are suppressed. |
| `lowImpressionShare` | Lower bound of impression share. See Impression Share Encoding below. |
| `highImpressionShare` | Upper bound of impression share. See Impression Share Encoding below. |
| `rank` | App’s impression share rank for this search term and country. `1` = highest share. |
| `searchPopularity1to5` | Relative search volume on a 1–5 scale. `5` = most popular. |

<a id="Impression-Share-Encoding"></a>

### Impression Share Encoding

The `lowImpressionShare` and `highImpressionShare` fields use a tiered encoding, not a continuous range:

| Impression Share | `lowImpressionShare` | `highImpressionShare` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0% | `0` | `0` |
| 1% – 90% | `x` (for example, `0.23`) | `x` (same value) |
| 91% – 100% | `0.91` | `1` |

For single-digit values (1–90%), both fields are equal. When `highImpressionShare` equals `1`, the app has \>90% impression share. The encoding preserves the range at that level to avoid false precision near market saturation.

The following limits and defaults apply to this endpoint’s requests and responses.

| Constraint | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Timezone | Fixed to `UTC`. |
| Granularity | Supports `DAILY` and `WEEKLY_SUN_SAT` only. |
| `DAILY` max range | 30 days (inclusive). |
| `WEEKLY_SUN_SAT` max range | 4 weeks. |
| Weekly start date | When `granularity` is `WEEKLY_SUN_SAT`, `timeRange.start` must be a Sunday. The endpoint rejects requests with a non-Sunday start date. |
| Default `pageSize` | 100. |
| Maximum `pageSize` | 10000. |
| Sort fields | Maximum 2 sort fields per request. |
| High-saturation bucket | `lowImpressionShare: 0.91, highImpressionShare: 1.0` indicates \>90% impression share. Marginal bid increases at this level yield diminishing returns. |
| Privacy filter | The privacy filter suppresses `searchTerm` for terms with fewer than 10 impressions in the aggregation period. |

<a id="Estimate-Market-Size"></a>

### Estimate Market Size

To estimate total eligible inventory for a search term, use impression share alongside confirmed impressions:

`estimated_market_impressions ≈ confirmed_impressions / lowImpressionShare`

**Example:** 10,000 confirmed impressions at `lowImpressionShare: 0.04` (4%) → ≈ 250,000 total eligible impressions. The same app at `lowImpressionShare: 0.91` (\>90% bucket) has captured nearly all available inventory. Single-digit precision makes this estimate meaningful across the 1–90% range covered by `lowImpressionShare`. Only within the 91–100% bucket, where `lowImpressionShare` and `highImpressionShare` diverge to `0.91` and `1.0`, does the estimate lose that precision.
