## Discussion

The `CreativeRejectionReason` object represents a record returned by the rejection reasons endpoint, describing why a specific ad creative was rejected. Each record includes the scope of rejection (by `adamId`, `productPageId`, or `assetId`) and the policy categories that were violated. To diagnose and remediate rejected ad creatives, use these records alongside `systemStatusReasons` on the [Creative](creative.md).

The endpoints that query and fetch `CreativeRejectionReason` records, `POST /v1/rejection-reasons/apps/query` ([Query Rejection Reasons](find-rejection-reasons.md)) and `GET /v1/rejection-reasons/apps/{rejectionReasonId}` ([Get Rejection Reasons](gets-rejection-reasons-by-id.md)), are documented under Apps \> App Eligibility. See [Query Rejection Reasons](find-rejection-reasons.md) and [Get Rejection Reasons](gets-rejection-reasons-by-id.md).
