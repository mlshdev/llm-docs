## Discussion

Use these operators in the `operator` field of a [FilterCondition](recommendationfiltercondition.md). Not all operators are valid for all field types. Applying an incompatible operator returns a 400 error with a validation detail identifying the invalid condition.

For example, here’s a `BETWEEN` filter on a campaign ID range:

```json
{
  "field": "campaignId",
  "operator": "BETWEEN",
  "value": [
    "10000",
    "20000"
  ]
}
```

Endpoints that accept a `RecommendationFilterCondition` are [Query Daily Budget Recommendations](query-daily-budget-recommendations.md), [Query Target CPA Recommendations](query-target-cpa-recommendations.md), [Query Target CPA Suggestion](query-target-cpa-suggestion.md), [Query Category Suggestions](query-category-suggestions.md), [Query Keyword Suggestions](query-keyword-suggestions.md), and [Query Phrase Suggestions](query-phrase-suggestions.md).
