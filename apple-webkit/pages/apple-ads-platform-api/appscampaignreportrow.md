# AppsCampaignReportRow

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** Apple Ads Platform API  
**Kind:** Object  
**Availability:** Apple Ads Platform API 1.0+

A single row in an apps campaign report, containing campaign metadata, total metrics, and optional granular time-series metrics.

## Declaration

```
object AppsCampaignReportRow
```

## Properties

- `totalMetrics` — `AppsCampaignMetrics`: See [AppsCampaignMetrics](appscampaignmetrics.md) for details.
- `granularMetrics` — `[AppsCampaignMetrics]`: Time-series metrics broken down by the requested granularity (for example, `DAILY`, `WEEKLY`). Present only when a `granularity` is specified in the request. When it isn’t, this field is absent and all data appears in `totalMetrics` instead.
- `metadata` — `AppsReportingCampaign`: See [AppsReportingCampaign](appsreportingcampaign.md) for details.

## Discussion

The `metadata` field captures campaign identifiers and configuration at report time. The `totalMetrics` field contains the aggregated performance figures across the full reporting period.
