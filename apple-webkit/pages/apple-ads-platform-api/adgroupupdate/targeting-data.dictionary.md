# AdGroupUpdate.Targeting

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** Apple Ads Platform API  
**Kind:** Object  
**Availability:** Apple Ads Platform API 1.0+

The targeting configuration for updating an existing ad group, specifying audience dimensions to include or exclude.

## Declaration

```
object AdGroupUpdate.Targeting
```

## Properties

- `country` — `AdGroupTargetingUpdate.Country`: Country-level geographic targeting. Include a country ID returned by the Geo Search API. See [TargetingDataUpdate](../targetingdataupdate.md).
- `adminArea` — `AdGroupTargetingUpdate.AdminArea`: Administrative area (state or province) targeting. Include admin area IDs returned by the Geo API. See [TargetingDataUpdate](../targetingdataupdate.md).
- `locality` — `AdGroupTargetingUpdate.Locality`: City or locality targeting. Include locality IDs returned by the Geo API. See [TargetingDataUpdate](../targetingdataupdate.md).
- `postalCode` — `AdGroupTargetingUpdate.PostalCode`: Postal code geographic targeting. Include postal code IDs returned by the Geo API. See [TargetingDataUpdate](../targetingdataupdate.md).
- `radius` — `AdGroupTargetingUpdate.Radius`: Radius targeting for Apple Maps campaigns. Valid values: `CLOSE`, `MEDIUM`, `FAR`. In practice, radius targeting applies only to `MAPS_SEARCH_RESULTS` campaigns. Avoid combining it with geo location targeting, though the API doesn’t enforce this constraint at the schema level. See [TargetingDataUpdate](../targetingdataupdate.md).
- `deviceClass` — `AdGroupTargetingUpdate.DeviceClass`: Device class targeting (for example, `IPHONE`, `IPAD`). See [TargetingDataUpdate](../targetingdataupdate.md).
- `minAge` — `AdGroupTargetingUpdate.MinAge`: Minimum age targeting for the audience. Minimum value is 18, maximum value is 64. See [TargetingDataUpdate](../targetingdataupdate.md).
- `maxAge` — `AdGroupTargetingUpdate.MaxAge`: Maximum age targeting for the audience. Minimum value is 18, maximum value is 64. To target users 65 and older, omit `maxAge` or send `include` as `null`. See [TargetingDataUpdate](../targetingdataupdate.md).
- `gender` — `AdGroupTargetingUpdate.Gender`: Gender targeting for the audience. Valid values: `M`, `F`. See [TargetingDataUpdate](../targetingdataupdate.md).
- `appCategory` — `AdGroupTargetingUpdate.AppCategory`: App category targeting based on App Store categories. Category ID `100` is a special value representing the same category as the promoted app. A value of `100` in `include` means you’re targeting apps in the same category as your app, and a value of `100` in `exclude` means you aren’t. See [TargetingDataUpdate](../targetingdataupdate.md).
- `appDownloader` — `AdGroupTargetingUpdate.AppDownloader`: Reach users who have downloaded specific apps. Use the `adamId` of the app you’re promoting in your campaign as an included or excluded value; API users can only pass in their own apps. To target all users, don’t include this dimension in the request payload. See [TargetingDataUpdate](../targetingdataupdate.md).
- `daypart` — `AdGroupTargetingUpdate.Daypart`: Time-of-day targeting (dayparting). Include-only. The API doesn’t support the `exclude` array for this dimension. Values are slot integers (0–167). For the full slot reference, see [AdGroupTargeting](../adgrouptargeting.md). See [TargetingDataUpdate](../targetingdataupdate.md).
- `locationGroup` — `AdGroupTargetingUpdate.LocationGroup`: Location group targeting for Apple Maps campaigns. See [TargetingDataUpdate](../targetingdataupdate.md).

## Discussion

Defines the audience dimensions, such as geography, demographics, device, and behavior, to include or exclude when updating this ad group. The `daypart` dimension is include-only and doesn’t support `exclude`.

See [AdGroupTargetingUpdate](../adgrouptargetingupdate.md) for the full field reference.
