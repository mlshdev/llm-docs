## Declaration

```
object CampaignTargetingUpdate.SupplySource
```

## Properties

- `include` — `[string]`: Supply sources to include in targeting. Don’t set on update; the campaign’s `supplySource` can’t be changed after creation.

## Discussion

The `supplySource` field is fixed at creation and can’t be changed by update. Including this field in an update request is unsupported, even when the value matches the campaign’s current `supplySource`. Valid values:

| Value | Ad channel |
| --- | --- |
| `APPSTORE` | App Store ads |
| `MAPS` | Apple Maps |

Each source has its own set of placements. See [CampaignTargetingUpdate.SupplyPlacement](supplyplacement-data.dictionary.md) for the full placement list, and [TargetingDataUpdate](../targetingdataupdate.md) for the `include`/`exclude` shape.
