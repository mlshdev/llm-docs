## Discussion

The `supplySource` field is **include-only**; setting `exclude` has no effect. Omit to leave unchanged. Valid values:

| Value | Ad channel |
| --- | --- |
| `APPSTORE` | App Store ads |
| `MAPS` | Apple Maps |

Each source has its own set of placements. See [CampaignTargetingUpdate.SupplyPlacement](supplyplacement-data.dictionary.md) for the full placement list, and [TargetingDataUpdate](../targetingdataupdate.md) for the `include`/`exclude` shape.
