## Overview

Budget orders are available to [Apple Ads](https://ads.apple.com/) customers that are on [monthly invoicing](https://ads.apple.com/help/billing/0031-monthly-invoicing). Budget orders work in addition to your [daily budget](https://ads.apple.com/app-store/help/bids-and-budget/0016-manage-budgets) to help you control costs. With a budget order, you can cap your total spend across campaigns in a campaign group set up through Apple Ads.

To use budget orders, an ad account must have a `LOC` (Line of Credit) `paymentModel`. In the API, Line of Credit (`LOC`) invoicing details are in [InvoiceDetail](invoicedetail.md). If you don’t have a billing model set up, campaigns default to Pay as You Go (`PAYG`) and budget orders aren’t available.

To confirm your payment model, call [Get Ad Account by ID](get-ad-accounts-_id_.md) and check the [AdAccount.PaymentModel](adaccount/paymentmodel-data.typealias.md) field in the [AdAccount](adaccount.md) response object. If you don’t have a payment model set up, you can still create campaigns, but you need to select a payment model before a campaign is eligible to run.
