# PolicyAssignmentQueryRequest

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** Apple Ads Platform API  
**Kind:** Object  
**Availability:** Apple Ads Platform API 1.0+

The request body for querying policy assignment with rejection reason details.

## Declaration

```
object PolicyAssignmentQueryRequest
```

## Properties

- `filters` — `[QueryFilter]`: Filter conditions for the query. Supported filterable fields are `promotedObjectId` (operators `IN`, `EQUALS`; filters by brand or promoted object ID) and `deleted` (operator `EQUALS`; includes soft-deleted records when `true`, excludes them when `false`). See [QueryFilter](queryfilter.md).
- `sorting` — `[QuerySort]`: Sort directives. Each entry specifies a `field` (for example, `id`) and `order` (`ASC` or `DESC`). See [QuerySort](querysort.md).
- `pagination` — `QueryPagination`: Pagination parameters. Default `pageSize`: 20. Default `offset`: 0. Set `fetchTotalCount` to `true` inside the pagination object to include the total count of matching records in the response. See [QueryPagination](querypagination.md).

## Discussion

The `PolicyAssignmentQueryRequest` object extends the standard `QueryRequest` pattern. It accepts `filters`, `sorting`, and `pagination` to retrieve paginated `BrandRejectionReasonResponse` records.
