## Discussion

On campaign creation, `bidStrategyType` and `bidStrategyGoal` are both required: you must send both fields, and the goal must match the type per these pairings: `MANUAL_CPT`↔`TAP`, `MANUAL_CPM`↔`IMPRESSION`, `MAX_CONVERSIONS`↔`INSTALL`, `MAX_ENGAGEMENTS`↔`TAP`. Omitting either field, or sending a goal that doesn’t correspond to the type, returns an error.

See [BidStrategyCreate](../bidstrategycreate.md) for the full field reference.
