## Discussion

This endpoint returns the full state of a location group, including its membership definition, current `systemStatus`, `groupTotal`, and `eligibility`. To confirm a group was created correctly, or to inspect its current membership before attaching it to an ad group’s targeting configuration, use this endpoint.

The response’s `systemStatus` field can take any of the following values:

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `VALID` | The group is fully evaluated and eligible for use in targeting. `groupTotal` reflects the current matched-location count. |
| `PENDING` | The system is evaluating the group’s dynamic rules. `groupTotal` may be `0`. Check again after a short interval. |
| `INVALID` | One or more issues prevent the group from serving. Inspect `eligibility` for details. |
| `DELETED` | The group has been soft-deleted and is no longer available for targeting. |

The `PENDING` status appears immediately after a `DYNAMIC` group is created or after its `rules` are updated. The `STATIC` groups transition directly to `VALID` because membership is explicit and requires no evaluation.

Fetching a group by ID differs from a bulk query in a couple of ways:

| Constraint | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Single group only | Retrieves one group by ID. Use [Query Location Groups](query-location-groups.md) to retrieve multiple groups with filters. |
| Deleted groups | Soft-deleted groups are still retrievable by ID. They appear in the response with `systemStatus: DELETED`. |
