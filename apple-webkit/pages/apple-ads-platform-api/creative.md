# Creative

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** Apple Ads Platform API  
**Kind:** Object  
**Availability:** Apple Ads Platform API 1.0+

Ad creative containing all data for visually rendering an ad.

## Declaration

```
object Creative
```

## Properties

- `id` — `int64`: Primary identifier. Read-only.
- `adAccountId` — `int64`: Reference to the Ad Account. System-assigned. Read-only.
- `name` — `string`: Name of the ad creative. Mutable.
- `creativeType` — `Creative.CreativeType`: Type of ad creative. Possible values: `CUSTOM_PRODUCT_PAGE`, `DEFAULT_PRODUCT_PAGE`, `LOCAL_ADS_SEARCH_CREATIVE`. See [CreativeType](creativetype.md). Immutable after creation.
- `creativeSpec` — `Creative.CreativeSpec`: Pre-tap ad experience specification with customizable attributes and assets. Contains data used to render the ad before user interaction. Empty for Product Page ad creatives (`CUSTOM_PRODUCT_PAGE` or `DEFAULT_PRODUCT_PAGE`) since pre-tap isn’t customizable. For `LOCAL_ADS_SEARCH_CREATIVE` the `creativeSpec` carries the Apple Maps ad creative spec (brand ID, asset references, and localized text). Not every sub-field within `creativeSpec` is mutable. Partially mutable.
- `destination` — `Creative.Destination`: Post-tap destination entity (embedded). Defines where users go after tapping the ad (for example, App Store product page). See [Destination](destination.md). Immutable after creation.
- `systemStatus` — `Creative.SystemStatus`: System validation status. Possible values: `VALID`, `INVALID`, `PENDING`. Read-only.
- `systemStatusReasons` — `[Creative.SystemStatusReasons]`: Reasons for system status. Read-only.
- `creationTime` — `date-time`: Creation timestamp. Read-only.
- `modificationTime` — `date-time`: Last modification timestamp. Read-only.
- `deleted` — `boolean`: Whether the ad creative has been deleted. Excluded from query results by default unless explicitly filtered to `true`. Read-only.
- `eligibility` — `Creative.Eligibility`: Eligibility data. Always returned unless excluded via `fields` parameter. See [CreativeEligibility](creativeeligibility.md). Read-only.

## Discussion

A `Creative` is the unit of visual presentation for an ad, composed of a pre-tap `creativeSpec` and a post-tap `destination`.

The `creativeType` field governs which `creativeSpec` variant applies:

- The `CUSTOM_PRODUCT_PAGE` and `DEFAULT_PRODUCT_PAGE` types use App Store product pages.
- The `LOCAL_ADS_SEARCH_CREATIVE` type is for Ads on Apple Maps.

The `systemStatus` field reflects the ad creative’s validation state:

- `VALID`: the ad creative can serve on an ad, though it may still be subject to additional review.
- `INVALID`: the ad creative has failed validation. For App Ads (`CUSTOM_PRODUCT_PAGE`, `DEFAULT_PRODUCT_PAGE`), you must create a new ad creative. For Apple Maps (`LOCAL_ADS_SEARCH_CREATIVE`), the ad creative may be recoverable by editing it (for example, adding a missing asset). Inspect `systemStatusReasons` to identify the cause.
- `PENDING`: the ad creative is undergoing system validation, policy determination, or waiting for asset CDN availability.

The system always returns the `eligibility` field unless you exclude it with the `fields` parameter. It summarizes whether the ad creative meets the requirements to serve ads on each supported ad placement.

Fields you can filter and sort on when querying ad creatives are listed in [Query Ad Creatives](post-creatives-query.md).
