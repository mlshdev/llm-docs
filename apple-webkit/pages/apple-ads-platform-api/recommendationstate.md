# RecommendationState

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** Apple Ads Platform API  
**Kind:** Type  
**Availability:** Apple Ads Platform API 1.0+

The lifecycle state of a recommendation, indicating whether it’s available to act on or has already been accepted or rejected.

## Declaration

```
string RecommendationState
```

## Possible Values

- `AVAILABLE`: The recommendation is active and has not yet been acted on. New recommendations are created in this state.
- `APPLIED`: The recommendation was accepted and the suggested change was applied to the campaign or ad group. Terminal state.
- `DISMISSED`: The recommendation was explicitly rejected. No change was made to the campaign or ad group. Terminal state.
- `DELETE`: The recommendation has been archived by the system, typically because the underlying campaign entity was removed or the recommendation became irrelevant, and is no longer surfaced in active queries unless explicitly filtered. Terminal state.

## Discussion

The `RecommendationState` tracks the advertiser’s response to a recommendation. Only recommendations in `AVAILABLE` state can be acted on. Applying or dismissing a recommendation moves it to `APPLIED` or `DISMISSED`, respectively, and creates a corresponding history record.

To retrieve only actionable recommendations, use the `state` filter in query requests:

```json
{
  "field": "state",
  "operator": "EQUALS",
  "value": [
    "AVAILABLE"
  ]
}
```
