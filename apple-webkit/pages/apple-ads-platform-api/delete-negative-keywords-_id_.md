## Discussion

This endpoint soft-deletes the specified negative keyword by setting its `deleted` field to `true`. The record remains queryable by including `deleted=true` in query filters. The operation returns HTTP 200 with an empty response body on success.

Once soft-deleted, the previously blocked search terms are no longer suppressed. If the deleted negative keyword was campaign-level, ads across all ad groups in the campaign may begin appearing for those queries again. If it was ad-group-level, only that ad group is affected. To temporarily stop suppression without deleting the negative keyword, use `PUT /negative-keywords/{id}` with `status: "PAUSED"`. To have the negative keyword start suppressing search terms again, set `status: "ENABLED"` instead of deleting.

The soft delete is reflected consistently across subsequent GET and PUT requests, and reversible by re-enabling the record.

| Constraint | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Soft deletion | Deletion sets `deleted=true` on the negative keyword record instead of removing it. The record remains queryable with the appropriate filter. |
| Exclusion is lifted immediately | Previously blocked search terms are no longer suppressed after deletion. |
| GET returns the deleted negative keyword | GET requests after deletion return the negative keyword with `deleted: true`, not a 404. |
| PUT returns 404 after deletion | PUT requests to update a deleted negative keyword return 404 Not Found. |
| Use ENABLED status to resume suppression | To have the negative keyword start suppressing search terms again, set `status: "ENABLED"` rather than deleting. |
