## Discussion

This endpoint deletes an ad group by its ID, using a soft delete: the system marks it `deleted: true` and preserves the record. By default, `POST /adgroups/query` results exclude it unless you filter with `deleted EQUALS true`.

Deletion cascades to all resources nested under the ad group: it also marks ads, keywords, and negative keywords as deleted. This operation can’t be undone.

Deleting an ad group has the following effects:

| Constraint | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Soft delete only | The system marks the ad group `deleted: true` but retains the record. |
| Cascade deletion | Deletion also marks all ads, keywords, and negative keywords belonging to the ad group as deleted. |
| Excluded from query results by default | `POST /adgroups/query` results exclude deleted ad groups unless you filter with `deleted EQUALS true`. |
| Parent campaign deletion also deletes ad groups | Deleting a campaign cascades to all of its ad groups and their nested resources. |
