## Discussion

This endpoint retrieves a single keyword by its ID. The response includes all keyword fields plus `displayStatus`, which reflects the combined delivery state of the keyword, its ad group, and its campaign.

Deleted keywords remain retrievable and only the query endpoint supports listing multiple records.

| Constraint | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Deleted keywords are returned | A deleted keyword is returned with `deleted: true`. The record is not removed from GET by ID responses. |
| Deleted keywords excluded from query results | `POST /keywords/query` omits deleted keywords by default. Add a `deleted EQUALS true` filter to retrieve deleted records. |
| Use query endpoint for listing | `GET /keywords/{id}` returns a single record. Use `POST /keywords/query` to filter and list multiple keywords. |
| `adGroupId` and `campaignId` always returned | The parent hierarchy IDs are always present in the response. |
