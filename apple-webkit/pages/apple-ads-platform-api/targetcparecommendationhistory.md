## Discussion

The `TargetCpaRecommendationHistory` object is an immutable record that the system creates when you apply or dismiss a target CPA recommendation. The record preserves both `recommendedTargetCPA` and `appliedTargetCPA` (the value actually used, which may differ if the advertiser supplied a custom override).
