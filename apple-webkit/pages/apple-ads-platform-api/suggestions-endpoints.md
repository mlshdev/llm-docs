## Overview

Suggestions are read-only discovery tools for campaign setup and keyword expansion. Unlike [Recommendations Endpoints](recommendations-endpoints.md), they’re stateless. There’s no apply or dismiss step and no lifecycle to track.

## Query the Suggestions Endpoints

For bid sizing when launching a new App Store [campaign](campaigns-endpoints.md), use [Query Target CPA Suggestion](query-target-cpa-suggestion.md) to retrieve the recommended target CPA based on recent tap-install CPI data. That endpoint uses a `filters`-only request body.

The three keyword discovery endpoints use a `POST /query` pattern with a [RecommendationQueryRequest](recommendationqueryrequest.md) body. Each result includes a `popularity` score on a 0–100 scale. To prioritize the highest-impact candidates, sort by `popularity DESC`. The suggestions API exposes four endpoints, each returning a different type of suggestion:

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/v1/suggestions/keywords/query` | Returns ranked keyword strings for a given app, scoped to a promoted object and optional App Store countries or regions. See [Query Keyword Suggestions](query-keyword-suggestions.md). |
| `POST` | `/v1/suggestions/phrases/query` | Returns natural-language search phrases associated with an app or brand, or matched by text. Supports `SUGGESTION` and `SEARCH` routes. See [Query Phrase Suggestions](query-phrase-suggestions.md). |
| `POST` | `/v1/suggestions/categories/query` | Returns genre category names for apps or brands, or matched by name. Supports `SUGGESTION` and `SEARCH` routes. See [Query Category Suggestions](query-category-suggestions.md). |
| `POST` | `/v1/suggestions/target-cpas/query` | Retrieves the recommended target CPA for an App Store app based on recent tap-install CPI data. See [Query Target CPA Suggestion](query-target-cpa-suggestion.md). |

### Keywords vs. Phrases

Keyword and phrase suggestions serve different targeting needs. [Query Keyword Suggestions](query-keyword-suggestions.md) returns single ranked keyword strings meant to seed exact-match keyword targeting, and its results feed directly into [Create a Keyword](post-keywords.md). [Query Phrase Suggestions](query-phrase-suggestions.md) returns natural-language, multi-word search phrases people actually type, useful for broader phrase-level discovery or gauging phrase traffic rather than picking discrete keyword terms.

### Request Keyword Suggestions

The `promotedObjectId` and `promotedObjectType` fields are both required. Optionally scope results to specific App Store countries or regions with `countriesOrRegions`, or seed with specific `terms` to get related suggestions. Results are [KeywordSuggestion](keywordsuggestion.md) objects. To activate a suggestion, create a keyword entity via [Create a Keyword](post-keywords.md). Here’s a sample request that scopes suggestions to a single app and two countries:

```json
{
  "filters": [
    {
      "field": "promotedObjectId",
      "operator": "EQUALS",
      "value": [
        "123456"
      ]
    },
    {
      "field": "promotedObjectType",
      "operator": "EQUALS",
      "value": [
        "APPSTORE_APP"
      ]
    },
    {
      "field": "countriesOrRegions",
      "operator": "IN",
      "value": [
        "US",
        "GB"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "sorting": [
    {
      "field": "popularity",
      "order": "DESC"
    }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "offset": 0,
    "pageSize": 20
  }
}
```

### Request Phrase and Category Suggestions

Phrase and category suggestions support two distinct query routes, and you can use only one per request:

| `queryType` | Purpose | Required Filters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SUGGESTION` | Discover suggestions for a specific app or brand. | `promotedObjectId`, `promotedObjectType` |
| `SEARCH` | Look up popularity for known values, or search by partial string. | `phrase` or `category` with `IN` (exact lookup) or `LIKE` (partial match) |

Use `SUGGESTION` when building a keyword list from scratch. Use `SEARCH` to check whether a specific phrase or category name has meaningful traffic, or to enumerate options with a partial string.
