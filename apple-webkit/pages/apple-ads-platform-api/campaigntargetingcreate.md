## Discussion

The `CampaignTargetingCreate` object is the create-time counterpart to [CampaignTargeting](campaigntargeting.md). It defines the supply source, placement, and geographic markets for a new campaign using [TargetingDataCreate](targetingdatacreate.md) objects for each dimension. All three dimensions are include-only: the `exclude` array isn’t supported at the campaign level. The [TargetingDataCreate](targetingdatacreate.md) at creation time corresponds to [TargetingData](targetingdata.md) in read and update responses. Once the campaign is created, use [CampaignTargeting](campaigntargeting.md) to read or update any of the three dimensions.
