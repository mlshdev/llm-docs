## Discussion

For campaigns using a Maximize Conversions bid strategy, `TargetCpaRecommendation` provides a system-calculated `recommendedTargetCPA` derived from historical `averageCPA` and projected performance. To evaluate the suggested adjustment, compare `recommendedTargetCPA` against `averageCPA`. Once actioned, the system creates a `TargetCpaRecommendationHistory` record.
