## Discussion

> **Note**

> The `KEYWORD`/`SKEYWORD` and `BID`/`SBID` categories are defined in this enum, but this API version doesn’t expose dedicated query, apply, or dismiss endpoints for keyword or bid recommendations. Only daily budget (`DAILYCAP`) and Target CPA (`TCPA`) recommendations have corresponding endpoints. See [Recommendations Endpoints](recommendations-endpoints.md) for the available endpoints.

The `recommendationType` field appears on every recommendation read object and always holds one specific category value. For example, [TargetCpaRecommendation](targetcparecommendation.md) always carries `TCPA` and [DailyCapRecommendation](dailycaprecommendation.md) always carries `DAILYCAP`. Apply and dismiss request bodies don’t include a `recommendationType` field.

Each optimization area has a merged category and a system (`S`) category. To retrieve all recommendations for that area regardless of origin, use the merged category (no prefix) in query filters. The system prefix variant allows filtering to only algorithm-generated recommendations.

When filtering a query for recommendations, always use the merged category (no prefix) unless you specifically need to distinguish system-generated recommendations.
