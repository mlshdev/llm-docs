# AdGroup.Targeting

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** Apple Ads Platform API  
**Kind:** Object  
**Availability:** Apple Ads Platform API 1.0+

The comprehensive audience and placement configuration for an ad group.

## Declaration

```
object AdGroup.Targeting
```

## Properties

- `country` — `AdGroupTargeting.Country`: Country targeting. Include a country ID returned by the Geo Search API. **Include only.** Used with App Store campaigns. See [TargetingData](../targetingdata.md). Mutable.
- `adminArea` — `AdGroupTargeting.AdminArea`: State or province targeting. Include admin area IDs returned by the Geo API. **Include only.** Used with App Store and Apple Maps campaigns. See [TargetingData](../targetingdata.md). Mutable.
- `locality` — `AdGroupTargeting.Locality`: City targeting. Include locality IDs returned by the Geo API. **Include only.** Used with App Store and Apple Maps campaigns. See [TargetingData](../targetingdata.md). Mutable.
- `postalCode` — `AdGroupTargeting.PostalCode`: Postal code targeting. Include postal code IDs returned by the Geo API. **Include only.** Used with Apple Maps campaigns. See [TargetingData](../targetingdata.md). Mutable.
- `radius` — `AdGroupTargeting.Radius`: Radius targeting, used with Apple Maps campaigns to restrict delivery to users within a given proximity of the brand’s locations. Valid values: `CLOSE`, `MEDIUM`, `FAR`. **Include only.** In practice, radius targeting is applied on `MAPS_SEARCH_RESULTS` campaigns and shouldn’t be combined with geo location targeting in the same ad group, but the API doesn’t enforce either constraint at the schema level. See [TargetingData](../targetingdata.md). Mutable.
- `deviceClass` — `AdGroupTargeting.DeviceClass`: Device class targeting. Valid values: `IPHONE`, `IPAD`. **Include only.** Used with App Store campaigns. See [TargetingData](../targetingdata.md). Mutable.
- `minAge` — `AdGroupTargeting.MinAge`: Minimum age targeting. Sets the lower bound of the target age range. Minimum value is 18, maximum value is 64. **Include only.** Used with App Store campaigns. See [TargetingData](../targetingdata.md). Mutable.
- `maxAge` — `AdGroupTargeting.MaxAge`: Maximum age targeting. Sets the upper bound of the target age range. Minimum value is 18, maximum value is 64. To target users 65 and older, omit `maxAge` or send `include` as `null`. **Include only.** Used with App Store campaigns. See [TargetingData](../targetingdata.md). Mutable.
- `gender` — `AdGroupTargeting.Gender`: Gender targeting, used with App Store campaigns. Valid values: `M`, `F`. **Include only.** See [TargetingData](../targetingdata.md). Mutable.
- `appCategory` — `AdGroupTargeting.AppCategory`: App category targeting. Category ID `100` is a special value representing the same category as the promoted app. A value of `100` in `include` means you’re targeting apps in the same category as your app, and a value of `100` in `exclude` means you aren’t. **Include and exclude supported.** Used with App Store campaigns. See [TargetingData](../targetingdata.md). Mutable.
- `appDownloader` — `AdGroupTargeting.AppDownloader`: Reach or suppress users based on whether they’ve downloaded specific apps. Use `include` to reach users who have downloaded those apps. Use `exclude` to suppress users who already have your app (acquisition targeting). Use the `adamId` of the app you’re promoting in your campaign as an included or excluded value; API users can only pass in their own apps. To target all users, don’t include this dimension in the request payload. **Include and exclude supported.** Used with App Store campaigns. See [TargetingData](../targetingdata.md). Mutable.
- `daypart` — `AdGroupTargeting.Daypart`: Hour-of-day targeting. Include slot integers (0–167) to restrict delivery to those hours. **Include only.** Used with App Store and Apple Maps campaigns. Values represent one-hour windows in a 7-day week grid starting on Sunday. See [AdGroupTargeting.Daypart](../adgrouptargeting/daypart-data.dictionary.md) for the full slot reference. See [TargetingData](../targetingdata.md). Mutable.
- `locationGroup` — `AdGroupTargeting.LocationGroup`: Location group targeting. Include location group IDs to restrict delivery to the business locations in those groups. **Include only.** Used with Apple Maps campaigns. For creating and managing groups, see [Managing Location Groups](../location-groups-overview.md). See [TargetingData](../targetingdata.md). Mutable.
