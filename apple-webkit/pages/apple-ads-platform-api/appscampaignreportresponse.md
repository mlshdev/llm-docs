# AppsCampaignReportResponse

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** Apple Ads Platform API  
**Kind:** Object  
**Availability:** Apple Ads Platform API 1.0+

The top-level response envelope for apps campaign-level reports.

## Properties

- `result` — `AppsCampaignResultContainer`: Wraps the array of report rows, each including campaign `metadata`, `totalMetrics`, and `granularMetrics`. If no rows match the request, `result` is returned as an empty object. See [AppsCampaignResultContainer](appscampaignresultcontainer.md) for details.

- `error` — `Error`: Populated with an `ErrorResponse` describing the failure when the request fails. See [ErrorResponse](errorresponse.md) for details.

## Discussion

Each row nests campaign `metadata` alongside `totalMetrics` for the full date range and, when requested, `granularMetrics` broken down by day.
