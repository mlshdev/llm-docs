## Discussion

This endpoint retrieves the full details of a specific business location registered in Apple Ads. The response includes the location’s address, geographic coordinates, business categories, and current status.

To verify location details before adding a location to a group, or to inspect the current status of a known location, use this endpoint.

The location’s `status` field can be one of the following:

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `OPEN` | The location is open and eligible for targeting in Apple Maps campaigns. |
| `CLOSED` | The location has permanently closed. |
| `MOVED` | The location has relocated. A new location record reflects the current address. |
| `TEMPORARILY_CLOSED` | The location is temporarily unavailable. |
| `OPENING_SOON` | The location is not yet open but will open soon. |

Retrieving a location’s details is subject to brand ownership and status limitations:

| Constraint | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Brand ownership | You can only retrieve locations belonging to brands accessible to your ad account. |
| Open locations only | Only locations with `status: OPEN` can be added to location groups and targeted in campaigns. |
