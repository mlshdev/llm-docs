## Overview

You can use the Siri Event Suggestions Markup data format to provide event details in webpages and emails. Siri parses travel arrangements, shows, restaurant reservations, and social events in order to augment related activities, like suggesting driving directions or a ride share to a scheduled event and activating Do Not Disturb just before a show starts.

When Mail receives an email or Safari loads a webpage with reservation markup, Siri also adds the event to the user’s Siri Event Suggestions calendar. Mail and Safari also inform the user that the content they’re viewing includes a reservation, so the user can accept or reject the event without leaving their current activity.

Include reservation markup data when you communicate about confirmed reservations with your users. Use a consistent [reservationId](sirieventsuggestionsmarkup/reservationid.md) each time, so the system can manage duplicates between Safari and Mail and across the user’s devices.

Fill out the form at [Siri Event Suggestions Markup Information](https://developer.apple.com/contact/request/siri-events/) to request inclusion in the domain allow list for event suggestion processing. See [Checking Your Reservation Markup](sirieventsuggestionsmarkup/checking-your-reservation-markup.md) for more details about testing your implementation before you apply.

> **Tip**

>  Donate reservation information from your app as well, if you have one. For more information about providing event suggestions from your app, see [Siri Event Suggestions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/sirikit/siri-event-suggestions).

### Format Reservation Data

If you offer reservations on a website or email reservation confirmations to users, you may provide reservation information embedded in HTML documents as either JSON-LD or Microdata. For JSON-LD, specify the [@context](sirieventsuggestionsmarkup/@context.md) and `@type,` as shown in this example:

```xml
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "http://schema.org", 
  "@type": "TrainReservation",
  "reservationId": "ASDF1234"
  /* more data goes here */    
}
</script>
```

For Microdata, provide the schema.org URL for the reservation in an `itemtype` attribute like this:

```xml
<section itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/TrainReservation">
Your reservation
<span itemprop="reservationId">ASDF1234</span>
is confirmed!
/* more data goes here */
</section>
```
