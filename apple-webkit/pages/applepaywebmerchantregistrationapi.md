## Overview

The Apple Pay Web Merchant Registration API is a REST API that enables platform integrators such as payment-service providers and e-commerce platforms to register web merchants who want to offer Apple Pay on the web.

As a platform integrator, you manage Apple Pay configuration on the merchants’ behalf when you call [Register Merchant](applepaywebmerchantregistrationapi/register-merchant.md). Merchants aren’t required to set up an Apple Developer account or configure their own keys and certificates — you set up a shared set of keys and certificates for your entire merchant portfolio. Register merchants with their own website domains, or with web pages hosted by your platform.

> **Note**

>  This API is available in production and in sandbox environments. To use this API in the sandbox environment, call the endpoints using the domain `apple-pay-gateway-cert.apple.com`.  For example, the sandbox endpoint for [Register Merchant](applepaywebmerchantregistrationapi/register-merchant.md) is: `POST https://apple-pay-gateway-cert.apple.com/paymentservices/registerMerchant`.
