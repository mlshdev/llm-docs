- Fixed handling of `::first-letter` pseudo-elements to always force `inline` display unless floated.(160710650)
- Fixed the behavior of the nesting selector `&` directly inside `@scope` to correctly act like `:where(:scope)` for proper specificity handling. (160769736)

- Fixed: Renamed `position-area` keywords from `x-self-start`, `x-self-end`, `y-self-start`, and `y-self-end` to `self-x-start`, `self-x-end`, `self-y-start`, and `self-y-end` respectively to align with updated CSSWG specifications.(162214793)

- Fixed an issue where underlines using `text-underline-position: right` appeared on top of the text in horizontal writing modes instead of under the line. (163506701)
- Fixed an infinite style resolution loop when a `position-try` box was inside a `display: none` tree. (163691875)
