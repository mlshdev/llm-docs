<a id="Overview"></a>

<a id="Accessibility"></a>

### Accessibility

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed list, table, tree, and canvas content being omitted from the accessible name or description when the containing element is referenced by `aria-labelledby` or `aria-describedby`. (186015032)
- Fixed VoiceOver repeating text it had already announced when a page streams content by re-rendering an `aria-live` region instead of appending to it. (186766347)

<a id="Animations"></a>

### Animations

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed `animation-range-start` and `animation-range-end` resolving incorrectly when `zoom` is applied, including when the value is inherited from an element with a different zoom factor. (185760120)

<a id="CSS"></a>

### CSS

<a id="Deprecations"></a>

#### Deprecations

- Renamed the `flow-tolerance` property to `fit-tolerance` for `display: grid-lanes`, keeping `flow-tolerance` as a deprecated alias that Web Inspector now flags. (185816680)

<a id="Forms"></a>

### Forms

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- Added support for `safe` and `unsafe` overflow alignment with `normal`, and for `safe` alignment on fixed position boxes so they stay in view even when that means overflowing their `position-area`. Also, applied `safe` alignment to `::picker(select)`, which keeps base appearance `<select>` pickers fully in view. (186812035)

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: Updated the default styling for `appearance: base-select` to center-align items, use `lh` units for padding, and reset all font properties on ::picker-icon and ::checkmark. (184843832)

<a id="HTML"></a>

### HTML

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed the window `load` event never being dispatched when a `readystatechange` handler starts a new load. (186475302)

<a id="JavaScript"></a>

### JavaScript

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed `for await...of` over an async generator skipping the `Promise.prototype.constructor` lookup required by `PromiseResolve` when that property is replaced. (183960626)

<a id="Media"></a>

### Media

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed `AudioContext.decodeAudioData()` failing with an `EncodingError` for valid AAC and M4A files whose file brand is not `mp4`. (183474728)
- Fixed video showing a black screen while audio continued to play after the video decoder was invalidated. (184041554)
- Fixed `ManagedMediaSource` not firing the `startstreaming` event when seeking to a time that is not buffered, which could stall playback. (185166787)

<a id="Networking"></a>

### Networking

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed cookies set by a top-level navigation’s own response being capped to a seven day lifetime when the site’s hostname is CNAMEd to a different registrable domain. (183787115)

<a id="SVG"></a>

### SVG

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>
