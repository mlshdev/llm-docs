## Overview

Before making a [Register Merchant](register-merchant.md) request, prepare each domain included in the request for verification.

After you set up the payment platform integrator ID in your Apple Developer account, download and distribute its domain-verification file to each merchant before you register their domain using the Web Merchant Registration API. If merchants need to accept Apple Pay payments from pages hosted on your domain, host this file on your own domain also.

You can find the domain-verification file for each of your payment platform integrator IDs in your Apple Developer account.

## Host the domain-verification file

Host the domain-verification file at the following path for each domain you’re registering:

`https://[DOMAIN_NAME]/.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association`

Make sure the domain-verification file is in place before invoking [Register Merchant](register-merchant.md). Use the domain-verification file associated with the payment platform integrator ID and payment platform identity certificate used to secure the Register Merchant request.

Apple Pay servers don’t require domain verification in the sandbox environment.
