## Overview

An e-commerce platform that’s enrolled in the Apple Developer program as an organization can apply to use the Apple Pay Web Merchant Registration API by completing the following steps:

1. Sign in to Apple Developer and fill out the [request form](https://developer.apple.com/contact/request/apple-pay-web-merchant-registration-api) for API access.
2. Once Apple grants access, create your unique Apple Pay payment platform integrator ID.
3. Set up your payment processing certificate and platform integrator identity certificate.

After you create your payment platform integrator ID, you can access a domain-verification file. You need to host a domain-verification file on a merchant’s domain before registering the merchant. For more information about domain verification, see [Preparing merchant domains for verification](preparing-merchant-domains-for-verification.md).

### Create a payment platform integrator ID

To use the Apple Pay Web Merchant Registration API, you need an Apple Pay payment platform integrator ID. This unique ID identifies you as an entity that can register merchants who wish to accept Apple Pay payments. Create your payment platform integrator ID and register it in your Apple Developer account. Payment platform integrator IDs never expire.

To create your payment platform integrator ID, log in to your Apple Developer account with the Account Holder or Admin role:

1. In [Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list), select Identifiers from the sidebar.
2. Select App IDs in the upper-right corner, and then select Payment Platform Integrator IDs.
3. Select the Add button (+).
4. Enter the platform description and identifier name, then click Continue.
5. Review the settings, then click Register.

The identifier name you enter is your payment platform integrator ID. If you have multiple environments, such as production and sandbox, you may choose to create additional payment platform integrator IDs for other environments.

### Create payment processing and merchant identity certificates

To complete your Apple Pay setup, create the two certificates associated with your payment platform integrator ID:

- A payment processing certificate that Apple Pay servers use to encrypt payment data
- A platform integrator identity certificate that you use to authenticate communication with Apple Pay servers

To create the certificates, log in to your Apple Developer account using the Account Holder or Admin role. For the payment processing certificate, see [Create a payment processing certificate](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/configure-app-capabilities/configure-apple-pay#create-a-payment-processing-certificate). For the platform integrator certificate, see [Create a merchant identity certificate](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/configure-app-capabilities/configure-apple-pay-on-the-web#create-a-merchant-identity-certificate).
