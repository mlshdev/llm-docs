### Create a wrapper tag and configure localization

Start by creating a wrapper tag for your button. Set the `id` to “`appleid-signin`”.

```javascript
<div id="appleid-signin"></div>
```

To configure the localization of the Sign in with Apple button, embed your desired localization code within the URI below:

```javascript
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://appleid.cdn-apple.com/appleauth/static/jsapi/appleid/1/en_US/appleid.auth.js"></script>
```

Replace `en_US` in the code above with your localization code. For a list of available locales, see [Incorporating Sign in with Apple into other platforms](incorporating-sign-in-with-apple-into-other-platforms.md).

### Specify property values

The folowing example creates a black Sign in with Apple button.

```javascript
<html>
    <head>
        <meta name="appleid-signin-client-id" content="[CLIENT_ID]">
        <meta name="appleid-signin-scope" content="[SCOPES]">
        <meta name="appleid-signin-redirect-uri" content="[REDIRECT_URI]">
        <meta name="appleid-signin-state" content="[STATE]">
    </head>
    <style>
        .signin-button {
            width: 210px;
            height: 40px;
        }
    </style>
    <body>
        <div id="appleid-signin" class="signin-button" data-color="black" data-border="true" data-type="sign-in"></div>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="https://appleid.cdn-apple.com/appleauth/static/jsapi/appleid/1/en_US/appleid.auth.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```

Control the size of the button by adding a class that contains the desired CSS `width` and `height` styles. The above example creates a button that’s 210 pixels wide and 40 pixels high, and sets the properties of the Sign in with Apple button as described in the following sections.

- **`logo-only`**: A square button with a centered Apple logo and no text.

<a id="Set-the-type"></a>

To configure the width of the Sign in with Apple button, set the `data-width` property to a value in points between `130—375`, or `100%` to fit the container size. The default is `100%`.

To configure the height of the button, set the `data-height` property to a value in points between `30—64`, or `100%` to fit the container size. The default is `100%`.

<a id="Set-the-logo-size-and-position"></a>

#### Set the logo size and position

You can control the size and position of the Apple logo on the Sign in with Apple button. These settings only work if you set `data-mode` to `left-align`.

To configure the logo position on the button, set the `data-logo-position` property to a number in points. The minimum value is `0` and the maximum is the label position. The logo remains positioned to the left of the label. The system may override the value to maintain proper margins for the logo and font size.
