## Overview

You can use search and search autocomplete in sequence by passing a [SearchAutocompleteResult](searchautocompleteresult.md) object as the query parameter of a search. For example, you can present the display strings of a collection of search autocomplete results to the user while maintaining a mapping to the original [SearchAutocompleteResult](searchautocompleteresult.md) object. When the user selects a result, make a search request with the corresponding [SearchAutocompleteResult](searchautocompleteresult.md) object to retrieve more information about the place.
