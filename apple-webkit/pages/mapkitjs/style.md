## Overview

You can assign a `mapkit.Style` object to an overlay to customize its appearance, such as changing the opacity of the fill or the thickness of the stroke. Style properties are observable, so MapKit JS automatically reflects any change to a style property on the corresponding overlays.

## Topics

### Creating a style

- [Style()](style/styleconstructor.md): Creates and initializes a style object.
- [StyleConstructorOptions](styleconstructoroptions.md): Initial values of options for applying style to overlays.

### Styling fills

- [fillColor](style/fillcolor.md): The fill color of a shape.
- [fillOpacity](style/fillopacity.md): The opacity of the fill color.
- [fillRule](style/fillrule.md): A rule for determining whether a point is inside or outside a polygon.

### Styling lines

- [lineCap](style/linecap.md): The style to use when drawing line endings.
- [lineDash](style/linedash.md): An array of line and gap lengths for creating a dashed line.
- [lineDashOffset](style/linedashoffset.md): The number of CSS pixels to use as an offset when drawing a line’s dash pattern.
- [lineJoin](style/linejoin.md): The corner style to apply when joining line segments.
- [lineWidth](style/linewidth.md): The width of a line’s stroke, in CSS pixels.
- [lineGradient](style/linegradient.md): The gradient to apply along the line.
- [LineGradient](linegradient.md): A line that displays with a gradient along the length of the line.

### Styling strokes

- [strokeColor](style/strokecolor.md): The stroke color of a line.
- [strokeOpacity](style/strokeopacity.md): The opacity of the stroke color.
- [strokeStart](style/strokestart.md): The unit distance along the line where a stroke begins.
- [strokeEnd](style/strokeend.md): The unit distance along the line where a stroke ends.

### Instance Methods

- [toString()](style/tostring.md): Returns a string representation of the style object.
