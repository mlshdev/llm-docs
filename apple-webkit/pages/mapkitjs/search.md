## Overview

The search service lets you populate a map with results from a user-entered query, including information about businesses and other points of interest. MapKit JS handles this through a search object that makes network requests to the search service.

Supplying *search context* creates the most relevant results for a query. Context can include the user’s location, or a coordinate or region that you provide.

To use the search service, create an instance of a search object with the desired options. Use the search object to make search requests.

## Topics
