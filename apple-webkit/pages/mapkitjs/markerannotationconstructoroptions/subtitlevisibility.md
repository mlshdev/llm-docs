## Discussion

The subtitle visibility controls the subtitle that renders below the balloon part of the marker. The default value is [Adaptive](../featurevisibility/adaptive.md).

For adaptive visibility, the subtitle is always hidden in the normal state, by default. In the selected state, the subtitle follows the same rules as the title.
