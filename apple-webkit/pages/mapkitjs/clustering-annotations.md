# Clustering annotations

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** MapKit JS  
**Kind:** API Collection

Combine multiple annotations into a single clustered annotation.

## Overview

Annotations display coordinate-specific data on a map, typically in the form of markers or images. To declutter annotation-heavy maps, MapKit JS supports *annotation clustering*. As the user zooms out on a map that contains annotations, MapKit JS groups individual annotations into a *cluster annotation* if they collide and if they share the same [clusteringIdentifier](annotation/clusteringidentifier.md).

The cluster annotation’s [memberAnnotations](annotation/memberannotations.md) property lists the individual annotations within the cluster. By default, a cluster annotation’s marker displays its member count.

MapKit JS creates cluster annotations automatically. Although you can’t instantiate a cluster annotation, you can customize the look of cluster annotations by providing a delegate method, [annotationForCluster](map/annotationforcluster.md), to the map.

### Understand the annotations arrays

Although visible on a map, cluster annotations aren’t members of the map’s [annotations](map/annotations.md) array. The annotations that make up the cluster do belong to the [annotations](map/annotations.md) array, however, even if they’re not individually visible on the map. For example, the following figure shows a map with annotations A, B, C, D, and E:

![A map showing annotations A, B, C, D, and E with markers.](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.mapkitjs/cluster-annotations-01@2x.png)

If the user zooms out so A, B, and C overlap on the map, the annotations combine to create cluster annotation Q, as in the following figure:

![A map showing cluster annotation Q, and annotations D and E. Annotations D and E have markers. Cluster annotation Q has the letters ABC in its marker.](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.mapkitjs/cluster-annotations-02@2x.png)

The map displays annotations Q, D, and E, and the resulting annotation arrays are:

- `Q.memberAnnotations = [A, B, C];`
- `map.annotations = [A, B, C, D, E];`

### Set cluster annotation properties

Cluster annotations have the same properties as other annotations, but you can’t set some values, including [coordinate](annotation/coordinate.md), [clusteringIdentifier](annotation/clusteringidentifier.md), and [draggable](annotation/draggable.md). Other values have specific defaults as the following table shows:

| Property | Default for clustering | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [title](annotation/title.md) | The `title` of the member annotation with the highest priority. | The annotation title text. |
| [subtitle](annotation/subtitle.md) | “`+N` more”, where `N + 1` is the number of member annotations. | The annotation subtitle text. |
| [coordinate](annotation/coordinate.md) | The average of the member annotation coordinates. | The annotation’s coordinate. The system automatically sets the coordinate of a cluster annotation to the average of all of the contained member annotation coordinates. You can’t change this value; therefore, the user can’t ever drag a cluster annotation. |
| [glyphText](markerannotation/glyphtext.md) | `N + 1` (the number of member annotations). | The annotation glyph text. |
| [draggable](annotation/draggable.md) | `false` | Determines whether the user may drag the annotation. You can’t modify this property. |
| [memberAnnotations](annotation/memberannotations.md) | NA | A flat array containing all annotations within the cluster annotation. Only cluster annotations have a `memberAnnotations` property. You can’t modify this property. |
| [clusteringIdentifier](annotation/clusteringidentifier.md) | `null` | A shared identifier for all of the member annotations. An annotation needs a `clusteringIdentifier` to be part of an annotation cluster. |
