## Discussion

Pass an `AbortSignal` from an `AbortController` to allow the controller to cancel a pending search or autocomplete request. When the controller aborts, the promise it returns rejects with a `DOMException` whose `name` is `"AbortError"`.

```javascript
const controller = new AbortController();
const search = new mapkit.Search();

try {
    const data = await search.search("coffee", { signal: controller.signal });
    // Handle results.
} catch (error) {
    if (error.name === "AbortError") {
        // The request was canceled.
    }
}

// Cancel the request at any time:
controller.abort();
```
