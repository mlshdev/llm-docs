# showsScale

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** MapKit JS

## Discussion

The scale doesn’t display above a specific zoom threshold (7500 meters per point). MapKit JS handles the placement of the scale automatically as follows:

- When the map shows the zoom control, the map displays the scale indicator in the opposite top corner.
- When the user location control already occupies the opposite corner, the scale indicator shifts horizontally to prevent overlap.
- When the map has no zoom or user location control, the map positions the scale indicator in the leading corner based on the text direction (top-left for LTR and top-right for RTL).

MapKit JS ignores invalid values, but reports them to the console.
