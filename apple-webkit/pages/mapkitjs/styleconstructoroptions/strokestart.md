# strokeStart

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** MapKit JS  
**Kind:** Interface Property  
**Availability:** MapKit JS 5.45+

The unit distance along the line where a stroke begins.

## Declaration

```
strokeStart?: number;
```

## Discussion

The value of this property must be a number between `0` and `1`. A value of `0`, the default, represents the beginning of the polyline, and a value of `1` represents the end. MapKit JS interprets values between `0` and `1` linearly along the length of the polyline.

The stroke is only visible for the overlay when [strokeStart](strokestart.md) is less than [strokeEnd](strokeend.md).
