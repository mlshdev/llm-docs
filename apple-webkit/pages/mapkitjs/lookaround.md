## Discussion

> **Note**

>  The full bundle of MapKit JS doesn’t implement this class.

Use a Look Around view to create street-level imagery for a specific geographic location on the map. You can, optionally, allow someone to navigate inside this view so they can explore the place at street level or zoom the view for a larger-screen experience.

> **Note**

> Not all places support Look Around.

The following example contains the two elements needed to display a Look Around View on a web page:

![A screenshot showing the Look Around view framing Cherry Hill Fountain, with a point-of-interest Marker.](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.mapkitjs/LookAround-cl-01@2x.png)

The HTML code below implements a web page that renders a `container` which has a label that provides a description of the place the Look Around view displays.

```html
<script
  src="https://cdn.apple-mapkit.com/mk/x/mapkit.core.js"
  crossorigin async
  data-callback="initMapKit"
  data-token="YOUR TOKEN HERE"
  data-libraries="look-around,services"></script>
<style>
#container { width: 735px; height: 552px }
</style>

<div id="container"></div>
```

The JavaScript listing below implements a MapKitJS Look Around object that the web page displays inside the `<div id="container">` element of the page. The Look Around view shows a navigable view of Cherry Hill Fountain in Central Park in New York City that Look Around renders using a PlaceID. For more information on obtaining a PlaceID for a specific location. For more information on Place IDs, see [Identifying unique locations with Place IDs](https://developer.apple.com/maps/place-id-lookup/).

```javascript
async function initializeMapKitJS() {
  if (!window.mapkit || window.mapkit.loadedLibraries.length === 0) {
    await new Promise(res => window.initMapKit = res)
    delete window.initMapKit
  }
}

(async () => {
  await initializeMapKitJS();
  // Look Around view code

  const placeLookup = new mapkit.PlaceLookup();
  const place = await new Promise(
      resolve => placeLookup.getPlace(
          // The PlaceID that represents Cherry Hill Fountain, Central Park, New York, NY
          "IEA18943388D2216C",
          (error, result) => resolve(result)
      )
  );

  // Create an interactive Look Around view.
  const lookAround = new mapkit.LookAround(
      document.getElementById("container"),
      place,
      {
          // Allow users to expand the view.
          showsDialogControl: true
      }
  );

})()
```

## Handling Look Around loading states

Look Around view dispatches the following events:

- `load`: A DOM `Event`. The Look Around view loaded.
- `error`: A [LookAroundErrorEvent](lookarounderrorevent.md). The Look Around view encountered an error, for example, in an unsupported browser, or a location with no Look Around imagery.
- `readystatechange`: A DOM `Event`. The ready state changed.
- `open-dialog`:  A DOM `Event`. The Look Around view is about to expand.
- `leave-dialog`:  A DOM `Event`. The Look Around view is about to contract.
- `close`:  A DOM `Event`. Someone has interacted with the close control.

## Topics

### Creating a Look Around view

- [LookAround()](lookaround/lookaroundconstructor.md): Creates a Look Around object you embed on a webpage and initializes it with the constructor options you choose.

### Controlling the interactions with a Look Around view

- [isNavigationEnabled](abstractlookaround/isnavigationenabled.md): A Boolean value that indicates whether someone can navigate inside the Look Around view.
- [isScrollEnabled](abstractlookaround/isscrollenabled.md): A Boolean value that indicates whether someone can scroll the Look Around view.
- [isZoomEnabled](abstractlookaround/iszoomenabled.md): A Boolean value that indicates whether someone can zoom the Look Around view.

### Controlling additional information the Look Around view displays

- [showsPointsOfInterest](abstractlookaround/showspointsofinterest.md): A Boolean value that indicates whether the Look Around view shows points of interest (POIs).
- [showsRoadLabels](abstractlookaround/showsroadlabels.md): A Boolean value that indicates whether the Look Around view shows road labels.

### Controlling the Look Around dialog

- [openDialog](abstractlookaround/opendialog.md): Opens the Look Around view in a dialog.

### Controlling the display of window controls

- [showsCloseControl](lookaround/showsclosecontrol.md): A Boolean value that indicates whether the Look Around view displays a close control.
- [showsDialogControl](lookaround/showsdialogcontrol.md): A Boolean value that indicates whether the Look Around view displays shows a control that allow someone to expand the Look Around view.

### Getting information about the Look Around object and its state

- [element](abstractlookaround/element.md): A property that represents the Look Around view’s containing Document Object Model (DOM) element.
- [scene](abstractlookaround/scene.md): The Look Around scene the framework is displaying.
- [padding](abstractlookaround/padding.md): The padding options for the Look Around view.
- [readyState](abstractlookaround/readystate.md): A value that represents the loading state of the Look Around object.
- [LookAroundReadyState](lookaroundreadystate.md): Values that indicate the state of the Look Around object in the browser.

### Closing and releasing a Look Around view

- [destroy()](abstractlookaround/destroy.md): Releases the Look Around view and its resources from memory.

### Events and event properties

- [LookAroundErrorEvent](lookarounderrorevent.md): A custom event object that contains information about the error when starting a Look Around view.
- [LookAroundErrorType](lookarounderrortype.md): Values that describes errors than can occur when starting a Look Around view.

### Static properties

- [ReadyStates](lookaround/readystates.md): A static property that allows you to access the Look Around ready state.
