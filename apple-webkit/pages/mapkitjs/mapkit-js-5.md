- Added the [cameraBoundary](map/cameraboundary.md) property, which restricts panning to a specified coordinate region. A change to the map’s camera boundary can be animated with [setCameraBoundaryAnimated()](map/setcameraboundaryanimated.md).

<a id="Updates"></a>

#### Updates

- Updated the behavior of setters that cause a selection state to change. For example, setting a `selected` property or adding a selected annotation cannot be done within the callback of `select` or `deselect` event listeners. Doing so will throw an error.

- Added support for customizing the display of distances, as in the scale control. The new [distances](map/distances-data.property.md) property on the Map object can be set to [Metric](distanceunitsystem/metric.md) or [Imperial](distanceunitsystem/imperial.md) to always display metric or imperial units, respectively.

- When [displayPriority](annotation/displaypriority-data.property.md) is set, the animation for the appearance and disappearance of [MarkerAnnotation](markerannotation.md) can be triggered. Now, the animation is also triggered when an annotation is hidden by other annotations or when it reappears after a change in zoom level.
- The [DirectionsResponse](directionsresponse.md) now includes a [polyline](route/polyline.md) property. The value of this property is a [PolylineOverlay](polylineoverlay.md), and can be added directly to a map.

<a id="Deprecated-features"></a>
