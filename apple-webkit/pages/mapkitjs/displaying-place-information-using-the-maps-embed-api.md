## Overview

You can use the Maps Embed API to show information about a place within the context of a map by copying an HTML snippet onto your website. This is a minimal code approach to showcasing place information. All you need is the following:

1. The ID for your place. See [Identifying unique locations with Place IDs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkit/identifying-unique-locations-with-place-ids) for more information about Place IDs, or find one with [Place ID Lookup](https://developer.apple.com/maps/place-id-lookup).
2. Your API token. See [Creating a Maps token](creating-a-maps-token.md) for more information on how to request a token.

Once you have these items, create the HTML snippet using [Create a Map](https://developer.apple.com/maps/create-a-map/), then copy the resulting HTML snippet and paste it onto your website.

Alternatively, you can construct the snippet yourself by manually adjusting the URL parameters in the snippet’s `src` attribute.

> **Note**

>  For greater control over the presentation style of the Place Card and map, use [PlaceDetail](placedetail.md).
