## Overview

MapKit JS creates a `MapFeatureAnnotation` when you set [selectableMapFeatures](map/selectablemapfeatures.md), and when a person taps a map feature. The instance is available from the [selectedAnnotation](map/selectedannotation.md) property when a person selects a map feature and MapKit JS passes it to the [annotationForMapFeature](map/annotationformapfeature.md) delegate method.

MapKit JS removes the annotation as soon as a person deselects the map feature.
