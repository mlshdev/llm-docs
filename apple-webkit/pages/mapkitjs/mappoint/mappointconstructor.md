## Discussion

The x and y values of the point are unit values. MapKit JS expects the value to be between `0` and `1,` and represents an interpolated location on the map projection in the x and y coordinates, respectively.

The following example creates a point that’s one-tenth across the map projection along the x-axis, and half way across the y-axis:

```javascript
const mapPoint = new mapkit.MapPoint(0.1, 0.5);
const x = mapPoint.x; // 0.1
const y = mapPoint.y; // 0.5
```
