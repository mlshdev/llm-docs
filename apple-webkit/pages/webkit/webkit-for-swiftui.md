# WebKit for SwiftUI

**Framework:** WebKit  
**Kind:** API Collection

Integrate web content into your SwiftUI apps with new standard views you connect to webpages.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

Present web content in your SwiftUI app with WebKit for SwiftUI. Use WebKit features to observe content and customize the web browsing and display experience.

Create a [WebView](webview-swift.struct.md) with a [URL](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/url) to display your web content. Apply view modifiers for various customizations, like displaying a find navigator, customizing scrolling behavior, configuring gesture behavior, and more.

Connect [WebView](webview-swift.struct.md) to a [WebPage](webpage.md) to interact with and react to changes in web content, such as observing navigation progress and calling JavaScript. You can use [WebPage](webpage.md) by itself when you don’t need to display the content directly.

> **Note**

> For more information about using WebKit in your app using SwiftUI, see [Meet WebKit for SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/231) from WWDC25.

## Topics

### Essentials

- [Building a cross-platform web browser](building-a-cross-platform-web-browser.md): Implement a browser on multiple platforms that loads content, manages navigation history, and saves favorite websites, using WebKit for SwiftUI.
- [WebView](webview-swift.struct.md): A view that displays some web content.
- [WebPage](webpage.md): An object that controls and manages the behavior of interactive web content.

### Managing navigation between webpages

- [WebPage.NavigationDeciding](webpage/navigationdeciding.md): Allows providing custom behavior to handle navigation changes and to coordinate these changes for the web page’s main page.
- [WebPage.NavigationAction](webpage/navigationaction.md): An object that contains information about an action that causes navigation to occur.
- [WebPage.NavigationResponse](webpage/navigationresponse.md): An object that contains the response to a navigation request, and which you use to make navigation-related policy decisions.
- [WebPage.NavigationPreferences](webpage/navigationpreferences.md): A type that specifies the behaviors to use when loading and rendering page content.
- [WebPage.FrameInfo](webpage/frameinfo.md): A type that contains information about a frame on a webpage.
- [WebPage.NavigationPreferences.ContentMode](webpage/navigationpreferences/contentmode.md): Options to indicate how to render web view content.
- [WebPage.NavigationPreferences.UpgradeToHTTPSPolicy](webpage/navigationpreferences/upgradetohttpspolicy.md): Preference for loading a webpage with HTTPS, and how failures should be handled.
- [WebPage.NavigationPreferences.SecurityRestrictionMode](webpage/navigationpreferences/securityrestrictionmode-swift.enum.md): Security restriction modes for WebView content.
- [WebPage.FormInfo](webpage/forminfo.md): A type that contains information about a form submission from a webpage.

### Observing navigation between webpages

- [WebPage.BackForwardList](webpage/backforwardlist-swift.struct.md): An observable representation of a webpage’s previously loaded resources.
- [WebPage.NavigationEvent](webpage/navigationevent.md): A particular state that occurs during the progression of a navigation.
- [WebPage.BackForwardList.Item](webpage/backforwardlist-swift.struct/item.md): A representation of a resource that a webpage previously visited.
- [WebPage.BackForwardList.Item.ID](webpage/backforwardlist-swift.struct/item/id-swift.struct.md): An opaque type representing the identifier for an item.

### Configuring a WebPage

- [WebPage.Configuration](webpage/configuration.md): A configuration type that specifies the preferences and behaviors of a webpage.
- [WebPage.DeviceSensorAuthorization](webpage/devicesensorauthorization.md): A type that describes the authorization permissions policy for the device’s sensors a web resource may access.
- [URLScheme](urlscheme.md): A type representing a valid URL scheme.
- [URLSchemeHandler](urlschemehandler.md): A protocol for loading resources with URL schemes that WebKit doesn’t handle.
- [URLSchemeTaskResult](urlschemetaskresult.md): A value used as part of a sequence of results from a [URLSchemeHandler](urlschemehandler.md), which can either be a `Data` or a `URLResponse`.
- [WebPage.Configuration.MediaPlaybackBehavior](webpage/configuration/mediaplaybackbehavior-swift.enum.md): The behavior used when playing HTML video within a page.
- [WebPage.DeviceSensorAuthorization.Permission](webpage/devicesensorauthorization/permission.md): The kind of sensor permission a web resource may request to access.

### Immersive environments

- [WebPage.ImmersiveEnvironment](webpage/immersiveenvironment.md): An object representing a website-provided immersive environment that is ready for presentation.
- [WebViewImmersiveEnvironmentView](webviewimmersiveenvironmentview.md): A SwiftUI view that renders a specific website-provided immersive environment.
- [allowsImmersiveEnvironments](webpage/configuration/allowsimmersiveenvironments.md): Indicates whether website immersive environments are allowed.
