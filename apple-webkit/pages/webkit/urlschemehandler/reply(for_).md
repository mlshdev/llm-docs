# reply(for:)

**Framework:** WebKit  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 26.0+ · iPadOS 26.0+ · Mac Catalyst 26.0+ · macOS 26.0+ · visionOS 26.0+

Produces a sequence of intermixed responses and data to load a resource for a given request.

## Declaration

```swift

```

## Discussion

Upon receiving the request, determine the size of the resource and add a [URLSchemeTaskResult.response(\_:)](../urlschemetaskresult/response%28__%29.md) value to the async sequence. Providing a response mirrors the behavior that a web server performs when it receives a request.

After you load some portion of the resource data, add a [URLSchemeTaskResult.data(\_:)](../urlschemetaskresult/data%28__%29.md) value to the sequence. Multiple of these values may be added to the sequence to delivery data incrementally, or a single one with all of the data.

If an error occurs at any point during the load process, a value of type `Failure` can be thrown to report it.
