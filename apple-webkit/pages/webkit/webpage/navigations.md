## Discussion

A specific navigation is comprised of a sequential set of [WebPage.NavigationEvent](navigationevent.md)s; a new navigation begins when an event is [WebPage.NavigationEvent.startedProvisionalNavigation](navigationevent/startedprovisionalnavigation.md).

This property produces a new sequence each time it is called, and starts tracking events as soon as it is created. The sequence is indefinite, but may be terminated under several circumstances:

- The owning [WebPage](../webpage.md)’s lifetime ends.
- An error occurs during navigation, at which point the sequence will throw the error and terminate.
- The `Task` enclosing iteration of the sequence is cancelled.

To track a specific programmatic navigation, use the return value of one of the loading APIs.
