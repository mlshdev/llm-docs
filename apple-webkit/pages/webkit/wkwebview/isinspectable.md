Defaults to `false`.

Set to `true` at any point in the view’s lifetime to allow Safari Web Inspector access to inspect the view’s content. Then, select your view in Safari’s Develop menu for either your computer or an attached device to inspect it.

If you set this value to `false` during inspection, the system immediately closes Safari Web Inspector and does not provide any further information about the web content.
