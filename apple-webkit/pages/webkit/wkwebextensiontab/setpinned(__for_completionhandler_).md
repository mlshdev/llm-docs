## Discussion

This is equivalent to the user selecting to pin or unpin the tab through a menu item. When a tab is pinned, it should be moved to the front of the tab bar and usually reduced in size. When a tab is unpinned, it should be restored to a normal size and position in the tab bar. No action is performed if not implemented.
