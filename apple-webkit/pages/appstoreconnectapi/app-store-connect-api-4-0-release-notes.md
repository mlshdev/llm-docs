<a id="New-Features"></a>

### New Features

- Use the new `webhooks` endpoints to setup and configure notifications for events that happen with your apps, including App version state events and TestFlight feedback events. For more information about webhook notifications, see [Webhook notifications](webhook-notifications.md).
- The [Accessibility declarations](accessibility-declarations.md) resources are now available to automate creating, updating, and reading accessibility declarations for your app per device family. You can also now use [Modify an app](patch-v1-apps-_id_.md) to update the `accessibilityURL` for your app. For more information about accessibility declarations, see [Configuring accessibility declarations for your app](configuring-accessibility-declarations.md).
- Get TestFlight feedback screenshots and crash logs from beta testers for your apps. For more information about beta-tester feedback, see [Beta feedback crash submissions](beta-feedback-crash-submissions.md) and [Beta feedback screenshot submissions](beta-feedback-screenshot-submissions.md).
- You can now read the customer review summary for your apps by using [Read Customer Review Summarizations](get-v1-apps-_id_-customerreviewsummarizations.md).
- You can now manage background assets for your app that you can upload and download separately from the Apple hosted app. For more information about these assets, see [Uploading and versioning Apple hosted background assets](managing-apple-hosted-background-assets.md).
- Activities for Game Center resources are now available; for more information, see [Game Center activities](game-center-activities.md).
- You can now setup and configure Game Center challenges. For more information on these challenges, see [Game Center challenges](game-center-challenges.md).
