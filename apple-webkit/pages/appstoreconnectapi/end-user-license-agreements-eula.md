## Overview

`endUserLicenseAgreements` represents the custom End User License Agreement (EULA) that you provide. Apple provides a standard EULA that applies in all territories. If you need to provide a custom EULA, use this resource to provide your agreement text. Relate it to the app and territories for which it applies using the [Territories](territories.md) resource.

For more information, see App Store Connect Help: [Create a new version](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/update-your-app/create-a-new-version).
