**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** App Store Connect API  
**Kind:** API Collection

Read metadata for app and App Clip binaries included in a build you upload to App Store Connect.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

A `buildBundles` resource represents metadata for binaries you upload to App Store Connect as a build. It provides detailed information like capabilities an app uses, supported CPU architectures, and more. For a full list of available attributes, see [BuildBundle.Attributes](buildbundle/attributes-data.dictionary.md).

When you upload a build that contains an App Clip, use the APIs provided by the `buildBundles` resource to read:

- Cache status information for domains you associated with your App Clip
- Debug status information for domains you associated with your App Clip
- App Clip invocations you configured for testers who use the TestFlight app to launch your App Clip
- File size information for a build bundle

## Topics

### Getting Build Bundle Information

- [Read the app clip domain cache status information for a build bundle](get-v1-buildbundles-_id_-appclipdomaincachestatus.md): Get the cache status of the domain you associate with your App Clip for a specific build bundle.
- [Read app clip domain debug status information for a build bundle](get-v1-buildbundles-_id_-appclipdomaindebugstatus.md): Get the debug status of the domain you associate with your App Clip for a specific build bundle.
- [List all beta app clip invocations for a build bundle](get-v1-buildbundles-_id_-betaappclipinvocations.md): Get all App Clip invocations you configure for testing for a specific build bundle.
- [List all file sizes for a build bundle](get-v1-buildbundles-_id_-buildbundlefilesizes.md): Get all file sizes for a specific build bundle.
- [Get the App Clip domain cache status ID for a build bundle](get-v1-buildbundles-_id_-relationships-appclipdomaincachestatus.md)
- [Get the App Clip domain debug status ID for a build bundle](get-v1-buildbundles-_id_-relationships-appclipdomaindebugstatus.md)
- [List beta App Clip invocation IDs for a build bundle](get-v1-buildbundles-_id_-relationships-betaappclipinvocations.md)
- [List file size IDs for a build bundle](get-v1-buildbundles-_id_-relationships-buildbundlefilesizes.md)

### Objects

- [BuildBundle](buildbundle.md): A specific binary bundle within a build, such as an app extension, App Clip, or nested app target.
- [BuildBundleType](buildbundletype.md): A string that represents the possible components of a build bundle.
- [AppClipDomainStatus](appclipdomainstatus.md): The validation status of the associated domains configured for an App Clip, indicating whether each domain is reachable and correctly set up.
- [BuildBundleFileSize](buildbundlefilesize.md): The estimated and actual download and install sizes for a build bundle, broken down by device type.
- [AppClipDomainStatusResponse](appclipdomainstatusresponse.md): A response containing the validation status of associated domains configured for an App Clip.
- [BetaAppClipInvocationsResponse](betaappclipinvocationsresponse.md): A response containing a list of TestFlight App Clip invocations for a beta build.
- [BuildBundleFileSizesResponse](buildbundlefilesizesresponse.md): A response containing a list of download and install size estimates for a build’s bundles.
