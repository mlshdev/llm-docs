## Overview

App Store Connect API version 2.0 provides resources that enable you to automate actions you take in App Store Connect.

<a id="New-features"></a>

### New features

- Added support for creating, managing, and submitting for review your in-app purchases and auto-renewable subscriptions, using the resources now available in the [In-App Purchase](in-app-purchase.md) and [Auto-Renewable Subscriptions](auto-renewable-subscriptions.md) collections. The [Promoted Purchases](promoted-purchases.md) resources can now manage promoted in-app purchases and auto-renewable subscriptions, including their visibility and images. The resources in the [In-App Purchase and Subscription App Store Review Submissions](in-app-purchase-and-subscription-app-store-review-submissions.md) collection manage submissions for review.
- The [Customer Reviews](customer-reviews.md) and [Customer Review Responses](customer-review-responses.md) resources support retrieving customer reviews for your app that appear on the App Store, and managing your responses to the customer reviews.
- [Power and Performance Metrics and Logs](power-and-performance-metrics-and-logs.md) adds a new `HANGS` diagnostic type filter for [List all diagnostic signatures for a build](get-v1-builds-_id_-diagnosticsignatures.md), updates the schema for responses in [xcodeMetrics](xcodemetrics.md), and adds support for long-lived tokens as described in [Generating Tokens for API Requests](generating-tokens-for-api-requests.md).

<a id="Deprecations"></a>

### Deprecations

- The [List all in-app purchases for an app v1](get-v1-apps-_id_-inapppurchases.md) endpoint is now deprecated and replaced with the [List all in-app purchases for an app](get-v1-apps-_id_-inapppurchasesv2.md) endpoint.

<a id="Removals"></a>

### Removals

- App Store Connect APIs for declaring IDFA usage are now removed. In your app, APIs that offer IDFA functionality are still available but require obtaining the user’s permission using [App Tracking Transparency](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apptrackingtransparency). You may also need to provide information about IDFA usage in your app’s privacy details on the App Store. For more information, see [User Privacy and Data Use](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/) and [App Privacy Details](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/).
