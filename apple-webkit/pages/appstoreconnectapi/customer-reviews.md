## Overview

The `customerReviews` resource represents the ratings and reviews that customers write for your app that the App Store displays. Customers can provide reviews for your app in the App Store, or when your app requests a review. For more information about reviews, see [Ratings, Reviews, and Responses](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/ratings-and-reviews/).

Use this API to read the customer reviews for your app as follows:

- Call the [List all customer reviews for an app](get-v1-apps-_id_-customerreviews.md) endpoint to get all customer reviews for your app. Filter the reviews by territory and rating, and sort them by date or rating. You can also get a list of the reviews with or without published responses.
- Call the [List all customer reviews for an app store version](get-v1-appstoreversions-_id_-customerreviews.md) endpoint to get the customer reviews for a specific app version.
- Call the [Read customer review information](get-v1-customerreviews-_id_.md) endpoint using the resource ID of the review to read the details of a specific review.

To manage your responses to the customers reviews, use the endpoints in [Customer Review Responses](customer-review-responses.md). For example, call [Get a customer review response](get-v1-customerreviews-_id_-response.md) using the resource ID of the customer review to read your response to that review.
