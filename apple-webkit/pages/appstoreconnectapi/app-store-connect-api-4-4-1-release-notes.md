## Added

- Manage in-app purchase metadata as discrete versions. Use [Create an in-app purchase version](post-v1-inapppurchaseversions.md) to create a new version, [Read in-app purchase version information](get-v1-inapppurchaseversions-_id_.md) to read a version, and [List the versions of an in-app purchase](get-v2-inapppurchases-_id_-versions.md) to list all versions for an in-app purchase. Each version exposes its own localizations and review screenshot through [List localizations for an in-app purchase version](get-v1-inapppurchaseversions-_id_-localizations.md) and [Read the image for an in-app purchase version](get-v1-inapppurchaseversions-_id_-image.md).
- Manage subscription metadata as discrete versions. Use [Create a subscription version](post-v1-subscriptionversions.md) to create a new version, [Read subscription version information](get-v1-subscriptionversions-_id_.md) to read a version, and [List versions for a subscription](get-v1-subscriptions-_id_-versions.md) to list all versions for a subscription. Each version exposes its own localizations and promotional images through [List localizations for a subscription version](get-v1-subscriptionversions-_id_-localizations.md) and [List images for a subscription version](get-v1-subscriptionversions-_id_-images.md).
- Manage subscription group metadata as discrete versions. Use [Create a subscription group version](post-v1-subscriptiongroupversions.md) to create a new version, [Read subscription group version information](get-v1-subscriptiongroupversions-_id_.md) to read a version, and [List the versions of a subscription group](get-v1-subscriptiongroups-_id_-versions.md) to list all versions for a subscription group. Each version exposes its own localizations through [List the localizations of a subscription group version](get-v1-subscriptiongroupversions-_id_-localizations.md).
- Submit an in-app purchase version, subscription version, or subscription group version to App Review. Use [Create a Review Submission Item](post-v1-reviewsubmissionitems.md) with an `inAppPurchaseVersion`, `subscriptionVersion`, or `subscriptionGroupVersion` relationship to add the version to a review submission.
- Use [Create an in-app purchase localization](post-v2-inapppurchaselocalizations.md), [Modify an in-app purchase localization](patch-v2-inapppurchaselocalizations-_id_.md), and [Delete an in-app purchase localization](delete-v2-inapppurchaselocalizations-_id_.md) to manage in-app purchase localizations, and [Create an in-app purchase image](post-v2-inapppurchaseimages.md), [Modify an in-app purchase image](patch-v2-inapppurchaseimages-_id_.md), and [Delete an in-app purchase image](delete-v2-inapppurchaseimages-_id_.md) to manage review screenshots. These v2 endpoints are scoped to an [InAppPurchaseVersion](inapppurchaseversion.md).
- Use [Create a subscription localization](post-v2-subscriptionlocalizations.md), [Modify a subscription localization](patch-v2-subscriptionlocalizations-_id_.md), and [Delete a subscription localization](delete-v2-subscriptionlocalizations-_id_.md) to manage subscription localizations, and [Create a subscription image](post-v2-subscriptionimages.md), [Modify a subscription image](patch-v2-subscriptionimages-_id_.md), and [Delete a subscription image](delete-v2-subscriptionimages-_id_.md) to manage promotional images. These v2 endpoints are scoped to a [SubscriptionVersion](subscriptionversion.md).
- Use [Create a subscription group localization](post-v2-subscriptiongrouplocalizations.md), [Modify a subscription group localization](patch-v2-subscriptiongrouplocalizations-_id_.md), and [Delete a subscription group localization](delete-v2-subscriptiongrouplocalizations-_id_.md) to manage subscription group localizations, including localized custom app names. These v2 endpoints are scoped to a [SubscriptionGroupVersion](subscriptiongroupversion.md).
- Use [List adjusted equalizations for a subscription price point](get-v1-subscriptionpricepoints-_id_-adjustedequalizations.md) to read the price points that App Store Connect uses to equalize a subscription’s price across territories when the base price point changes. Filter the endpoint with `filter[upfrontPricePointId]` and `filter[planType]` to identify a specific adjusted equalization.
- Added the `socialMedia` and `socialMediaAgeRestricted` Boolean attributes to [AgeRatingDeclaration](ageratingdeclaration.md) and [AgeRatingDeclarationUpdateRequest](ageratingdeclarationupdaterequest.md), so you can declare whether your app includes social media features and whether those features are age-restricted.
