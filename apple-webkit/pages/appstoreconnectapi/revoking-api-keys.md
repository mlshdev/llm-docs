## Overview

Revoke an API key immediately if it becomes inactive, lost, or compromised. A revoked API key denies access to the App Store Connect API on your organization’s behalf.

> **Important**

>  Once you revoke an API key, you can’t reinstate it. Revoked keys are displayed for 30 days on the API Keys page under the Revoked heading.

To revoke your own key:
