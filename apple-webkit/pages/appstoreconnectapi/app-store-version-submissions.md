## Overview

An `appStoreVersionSubmissions` resource enables you to submit a version of your app to App Review. This resource is the equivalent of clicking the Submit for Review button in the App Store Connect UI.

If your version submission is incomplete due to missing required information or other issues, you receive an error when you attempt to submit to App Review.

The `appStoreVersionSubmissions` resource is available while your submission request is live. For more information, see [Submit for review](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-submissions-to-app-review/submit-for-review).
