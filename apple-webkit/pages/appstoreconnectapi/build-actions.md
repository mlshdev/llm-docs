# Build Actions

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** App Store Connect API  
**Kind:** API Collection

Read information about actions you configured for an Xcode Cloud workflow and their related data such as artifacts, issues, or test results.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

The `ciBuildActions` resource represents the actions Xcode Cloud performed when it built your project or workspace. Use it to read information about the actions Xcode Cloud performed during a build; for example:

- Type, name, and date information of the action
- Status information for an ongoing and completed action
- Artifacts created by the action
- Issues that occurred
- Detailed information about test results

To update a workflow’s actions, use the [Workflows](workflows.md) resource.

> **Note**

>  This resource supports JSON web tokens with a lifetime of up to six months. For more information, see [Determine the Appropriate Token Lifetime](generating-tokens-for-api-requests.md#Determine-the-Appropriate-Token-Lifetime).
