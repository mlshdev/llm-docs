<a id="New-Features"></a>

### New Features

- You can now submit Game Center content directly to review without including an app version by using [Review submissions](review-submissions.md). Use [Create a Review Submission Item](post-v1-reviewsubmissionitems.md) to submit achievement versions, leaderboard versions, leaderboard set versions, activity versions, and challenge versions for independent review.
- Game Center resources now support versioning for achievements, leaderboards, and leaderboard sets. To learn more, see [Game Center achievements](game-center-achievements.md), [Game Center leaderboards](game-center-leaderboards.md), and [Game Center leaderboard sets](game-center-leaderboard-sets.md).
- Added support for In-App Purchase offer codes for consumable, non-consumable, and non-renewing subscriptions. Create and manage promotional offer codes using [Create an In-App Purchase Offer Code](post-v1-inapppurchaseoffercodes.md), [Create an In-App Purchase Offer Code Custom Code](post-v1-inapppurchaseoffercodecustomcodes.md), and [Create an In-App Purchase Offer Code One-Time Use Code](post-v1-inapppurchaseoffercodeonetimeusecodes.md). To learn more, see [In-App Purchase Offer Codes](in-app-purchase-offers.md).
- The `appDevices` attribute is now available on the [BetaTester.Attributes](betatester/attributes-data.dictionary.md) resource, enabling you to view the device models used by beta testers for your app’s TestFlight testing.
- Background asset versions now include a `stateDetails` attribute that provides additional context about the asset state, including errors, warnings, and informational messages for failed imports. Access this information using [Read background asset version information](get-v1-backgroundassetversions-_id_.md).
- There is a new string `PAY_TO_PARK` available for `mapAction` when creating or modifying an App Clip advanced experience. To learn more, see [AppClipAdvancedExperience.Attributes.Place](appclipadvancedexperience/attributes-data.dictionary/place-data.dictionary.md).
- You can now map your Android apps to your iOS apps using the [Android to iOS App Mapping](android-to-ios-app-mapping.md) resource. This mapping enables data and app migration between Android and iOS devices during device setup. Use [Create an Android to iOS App Mapping Detail](post-v1-androidtoiosappmappingdetails.md) to create mappings with your Android app’s package name and signing certificate fingerprints.
- [Webhook notifications](webhook-notifications.md) now includes events for alternative app distribution. To learn more see, [Configuring and parsing App Store Connect API webhook notifications](configuring-webhook-notifications.md) and [Understanding webhook events](webhook-events.md).
- Alternative distribution packages now include a `sourceFileChecksum` attribute, allowing alternative marketplaces to verify builds with developers. Use [Read Alternative Distribution Package Information](get-v1-alternativedistributionpackages-_id_.md) to access the checksum of the developer-submitted package.

### Removals

- The attribute `challengeEnabled` is now removed from [Enable game center for an app](post-v1-gamecenterdetails.md) and [Modify a game center detail for an app](patch-v1-gamecenterdetails-_id_.md). To create a challenge on an existing Game Center detail, use [Create a Challenge](post-v1-gamecenterchallenges.md).
