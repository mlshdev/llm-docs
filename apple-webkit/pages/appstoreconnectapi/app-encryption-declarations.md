# App Encryption Declarations

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** App Store Connect API  
**Kind:** API Collection

View, and assign to builds, the declarations about types of encryption used in your app.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

To comply with regulatory requirements, you sometimes need to provide information and supporting documentation in the form of declarations about the types of encryption used by your app. The app encryption declarations resource represents this information, and enables you to:

- View information about the declaration, and
- Assign the declaration to a build.
- Create app encryption declarations in App Store Connect.
- Upload app encryption declaration documents.

> **Note**

>  Builds that have the `usesNonExemptEncryption` flag set to true in the app’s property list must link to an app encryption declaration before the app can be submitted for beta app review.

For more information, see [Overview of export compliance](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-information/overview-of-export-compliance).
