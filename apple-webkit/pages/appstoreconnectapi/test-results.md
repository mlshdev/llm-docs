## Overview

The `ciTestResult` resource represents the test results that Xcode Cloud makes available if you configure a workflow to include a test action. Use this resource to access:

- The name of the test class
- Test file information
- The name and operating system version of the simulated device that Xcode Cloud used to perform the tests
- The time it took to run the tests
- Test status information
- A unique identifier for the tests Xcode Cloud ran

> **Note**

>  This resource supports JSON web tokens with a lifetime of up to six months. For more information, see [Determine the Appropriate Token Lifetime](generating-tokens-for-api-requests.md#Determine-the-Appropriate-Token-Lifetime).
