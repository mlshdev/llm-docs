## Overview

An `appScreenshotSets` resource represents a set of screenshots that you intend to upload to App Store Connect. Create an `appScreenshotSets` resource as a container for all screenshots associated with a locale and display target, for example, screenshots for Simplified Chinese on an iPhone with a 6.5” display. Next, upload individual screenshots using the [App Screenshots](app-screenshots.md) resource.

> **Important**

>  Some screenshot sizes are required to submit your app for review. For more information, see [Screenshot specifications](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/reference/screenshot-specifications).
