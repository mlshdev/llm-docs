## Overview

App Store Connect API version 4.5 provides resources that enable you to automate actions you take in App Store Connect.

<a id="Added"></a>

## Added

- Evaluate your app’s performance before you release an update. Use [Get the performance overview for an app](get-v1-apps-_id_-performanceoverviews.md) to read the aggregated performance overview data for an app, including the metrics Xcode surfaces in its performance reports.
- Offer subscriptions to organizations. The `marketSettings` and `multiSeatStatus` attributes on [Subscription](subscription.md) indicate the markets where a subscription is available — the App Store, Apple School Manager, or Apple Business Manager — and whether the subscription supports multiple seats.
- Moderate Game Center leaderboard scores and the players who submit them. Use [List Score Moderations for a Leaderboard](get-v2-gamecenterleaderboards-_id_-gamecenterscoremoderations.md) to review the scores submitted to a leaderboard and [Modify a Game Center Score Moderation](patch-v1-gamecenterscoremoderations-_id_.md) to block a score. Read the players a game blocks with [List Blocked Players](get-v1-gamecenterdetails-_id_-blockedplayers.md), and block or unblock an individual player with [Modify a Game Center Detail Player](patch-v1-gamecenterdetailplayers-_id_.md).
- Align your app with Korea’s age-rating classifications. Use the `ALL` and `TWELVE_PLUS` values in the `koreaAgeRatingOverride` attribute of [AgeRatingDeclaration](ageratingdeclaration.md) to set the most accurate age-rating classification.

<a id="Deprecated"></a>

## Deprecated

- The `territories` relationship on app tags is now deprecated, along with the [List Territories for an App Tag](get-v1-apptags-_id_-territories.md) and [List territory IDs for an app tag](get-v1-apptags-_id_-relationships-territories.md) endpoints. On [List App Tags](get-v1-apps-_id_-apptags.md), the `include`, `fields[appTags]`, `fields[territories]`, and `limit[territories]` parameters no longer accept `territories` values.
