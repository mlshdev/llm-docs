<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

The `subscriptionPlanAvailabilities` resource lets you control which subscription plan type — monthly or up-front — is available for a subscription in specific territories.

There are two possible values for the subscription plan type: `MONTHLY` and `UPFRONT`. To learn more, see [SubscriptionPlanType](subscriptionplantype.md) and [Set availability for an auto-renewable subscription](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-subscriptions/set-availability-for-an-auto-renewable-subscription).

Use it to:

- Create a plan availability configuration for a subscription.
- Read or modify the available territories for a plan availability.
- Update available territories for a subscription plan availability.
