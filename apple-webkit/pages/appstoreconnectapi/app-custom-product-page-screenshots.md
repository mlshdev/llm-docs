- Upload new app screenshots to App Store Connect.
- Download existing screenshots.

To upload screenshots, begin by using the [Create an app screenshot set](post-v1-appscreenshotsets.md) endpoint for the locale and display target. To upload screenshots, you must create an asset reservation, then follow the upload operations specified in the response.
