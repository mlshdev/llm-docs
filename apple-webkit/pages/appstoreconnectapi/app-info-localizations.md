## Overview

`appInfoLocalizations` represent your app’s localized metadata that is displayed in the App Store. You can create, read, update, and remove the localized metadata. It includes the following attributes for each localization:

- Locale
- Name
- Subtitle
- Privacy policy URL
- Privacy policy text (for tvOS apps)

You can update localized metadata when your app is in an editable state. For more information about the metadata, see [Localize App Store information](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-information/localize-app-store-information). For a list of supported languages, see [App Store localizations](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-store-localizations).

> **Note**

>  The languages you add to an `appInfoLocalizations` resource only affect your app’s metadata. To add languages to your app’s binary, see [What is localization](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/deve2bc11fab).
