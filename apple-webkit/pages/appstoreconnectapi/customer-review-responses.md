## Overview

The `customerReviewResponses` resource represents your responses to customer reviews for apps you publish on the App Store. Each customer review can have at most one review response.

Use this API to get, create, update, and delete your responses to customer reviews for your app. First, get a list of customer reviews, including their resource IDs, by calling the [List all customer reviews for an app](get-v1-apps-_id_-customerreviews.md) or [List all customer reviews for an app store version](get-v1-appstoreversions-_id_-customerreviews.md) endpoints. Next use this API as follows:

- Respond to a customer review by calling [Create or update a response to a customer review](post-v1-customerreviewresponses.md) using the review’s resource ID. Update your existing review using the same endpoint.
- Get your existing review response by calling [Get a customer review response](get-v1-customerreviews-_id_-response.md), using the resource ID of the customer review.
- Delete your response to a customer review by calling [Delete a response to a customer review](delete-v1-customerreviewresponses-_id_.md), using the resource ID of your response.
