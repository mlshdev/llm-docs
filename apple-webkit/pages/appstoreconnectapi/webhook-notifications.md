## Overview

Webhooks enable a system to send real-time data to another system over the web. Unlike traditional APIs, where one system must make a request when receiving data, a webhook enables you to push data to the receiving system as soon as an event occurs. Webhooks are *event-driven*, meaning they are triggered by a specific action or event and immediately send the relevant data to a predefined URL, also called the “webhook URL” or “callback URL”.

A notification webhook is an endpoint you create on your server. This webhook endpoint receives `HTTP POST` requests from App Store Connect. The `POST` requests describe important events about your app. Use the webhooks notifications endpoint to configure the notifications for events happening to your apps.

To invoke your webhook, App Store Connect needs to know your server’s webhook endpoint URL. To set up your webhook endpoint the first time, provide the URL to the [Create a Webhook Configuration](post-v1-webhooks.md) endpoint.

To learn more about:

- Configuring a webhook URL using the API, see [Configuring and parsing App Store Connect API webhook notifications](configuring-webhook-notifications.md).
- Events that can trigger a webhook notification, see [Understanding webhook events](webhook-events.md) and [WebhookEventType](webhookeventtype.md).

### Testing webhook configuration

- [Test Your Webhook](post-v1-webhookpings.md): Send an event to your server to verify your server-side webhook configuration.

### Objects and types

- [WebhookDeliveryCreateRequest](webhookdeliverycreaterequest.md): The request body for retrying a failed webhook delivery.
- [WebhookDeliveryResponse](webhookdeliveryresponse.md): A response containing a single webhook delivery attempt record.
- [WebhookEvent](webhookevent.md): An event type that can trigger webhook notifications, such as build completion or review status changes.
- [WebhookPing](webhookping.md): A test payload sent to verify that a webhook endpoint is reachable and correctly configured.
- [WebhookPingCreateRequest](webhookpingcreaterequest.md): The request body for sending a test ping event to verify that a webhook endpoint is reachable.
- [WebhookPingResponse](webhookpingresponse.md): A response confirming that a test ping was sent to a webhook endpoint.
- [WebhookResponse](webhookresponse.md): The response body for endpoints that create, read, or modify a single webhook.
- [WebhookUpdateRequest](webhookupdaterequest.md): The request body you use to update a webhook update request.
