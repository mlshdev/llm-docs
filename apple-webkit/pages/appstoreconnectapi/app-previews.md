An `appPreviews` resource represents a single app preview for an app locale and display target. Use this resource to:

- Upload new app previews to App Store Connect.
- Download existing app previews.
- Set a custom timestamp for the preview’s poster frame.

To upload app previews, begin by creating an [App Preview Sets](app-preview-sets.md) resource for the locale and display target. For more information, see [App preview specifications](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-preview-specifications).
