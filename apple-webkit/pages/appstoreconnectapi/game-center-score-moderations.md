# Game Center score moderations

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** App Store Connect API  
**Kind:** API Collection

Review and moderate scores players submit to your app’s leaderboards.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Score moderations represent the scores players submit to a Game Center leaderboard, which you review and choose to block or unblock. Blocking a score removes it from the leaderboard, and unblocking reinstates it. Use this resource to:

- Read the scores players submit to a leaderboard, and filter them by whether they’re blocked.
- Block or unblock a submitted score.

For the equivalent workflow in App Store Connect, see [Manage scores and players](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/configure-game-center/manage-scores-and-players/). For more information about configuring leaderboards, see [Configure leaderboards](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/configure-game-center/configure-leaderboards/).
