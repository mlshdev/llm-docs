# Configuring multi-seat subscriptions for organizations

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** App Store Connect API  
**Kind:** Article

Control whether organizations can purchase an auto-renewable subscription for multiple people, and which markets offer it.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Organizations can buy your auto-renewable subscriptions in quantities greater than one through Apple Business Manager (Enterprise) and Apple School Manager (Education). To learn more, see [Apple School Manager and Apple Business APIs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple-school-and-business-manager-api). Use the `multiSeatStatus` and `marketSettings` attributes on the subscriptions resource to control whether a subscription supports these multi-seat purchases and which markets offer it. Both attributes apply only to auto-renewable subscriptions; updating them on any other in-app purchase type returns an error.

Before you configure multi-seat settings, create an auto-renewable subscription as described in [Managing auto-renewable subscriptions](managing-auto-renewable-subscriptions.md). To update these attributes, be sure you have one of the following user roles:

- `ACCOUNT_HOLDER`
- `ADMIN`
- `APP_MANAGER`

API keys with the `MARKETING` role have read-only access to both attributes.

### Turn multi-seat purchasing on or off

Every auto-renewable subscription defaults to `multiSeatStatus` of `ENABLED`, so you only need to set this attribute when you want to change a subscription’s current state. To update it, use [Modify an auto-renewable subscription](patch-v1-subscriptions-_id_.md) with a payload that sets the `multiSeatStatus`.

Here’s an example payload that turns multi-seat purchasing on for a subscription:

```other
{
  "data": {
    "type": "subscriptions",
    "id": "6446671421",
    "attributes": {
      "multiSeatStatus": "ENABLED"
    }
  }
}
```

The `multiSeatStatus` attribute accepts the following values:

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ENABLED` | An organization can purchase the subscription in quantities greater than one. This is the default for every auto-renewable subscription. |
| `DISABLED` | Restricts the subscription to single-seat (quantity of one) purchases. New multi-seat purchases stop, and Apple Business Manager and Apple School Manager no longer offer the SKU. Existing multi-seat subscribers keep renewing at their current seat count but can’t add seats. |

> **Note**

>  Turning on Family Sharing for a subscription automatically sets `multiSeatStatus` to `DISABLED`. If you turn multi-seat purchasing back on for a family-shareable subscription, Family Sharing only applies when the a single seat is purchased.

### Choose which markets offer multi-seat purchases

After you turn on multi-seat purchasing, use the `marketSettings` attribute to choose which markets support multi-seat purchases of the subscription. Update it with the same `PATCH /v1/subscriptions/{id}` ([Modify an auto-renewable subscription](patch-v1-subscriptions-_id_.md)) endpoint, providing an array of markets.

Here’s an example payload that makes a subscription available for multi-seat purchase on the App Store and through Apple Business Manager, but not Apple School Manager:

```other
{
  "data": {
    "type": "subscriptions",
    "id": "6446671421",
    "attributes": {
      "marketSettings": [
        "APP_STORE",
        "APPLE_BUSINESS"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

`marketSettings` accepts an array containing any of the following values:

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `APP_STORE` | The subscription is available for multi-seat purchase directly on the App Store. |
| `APPLE_BUSINESS` | The subscription is available for purchase in quantity through Apple Business Manager, for enterprise organizations. |
| `APPLE_SCHOOL` | The subscription is available for purchase in quantity through Apple School Manager, for education institutions. |

> **Important**

>  `marketSettings` only has an effect while `multiSeatStatus` is `ENABLED`. If `multiSeatStatus` is `DISABLED`, the subscription isn’t available for multi-seat purchase in any market, regardless of which values you set in `marketSettings`.

### Verify your configuration

To confirm the current settings, use `GET /v1/subscriptions/{id}` ([Read subscription information](get-v1-subscriptions-_id_.md)) and check the `multiSeatStatus` and `marketSettings` values in the response.

For example:

```other
GET /v1/subscriptions/6446671421
```

Here’s the example response, truncated for clarity:

```other
{
  "data" : {
    "type" : "subscriptions",
    "id" : "6446671421",
    "attributes" : {
      "multiSeatStatus" : "ENABLED",
      "marketSettings" : [ "APP_STORE", "APPLE_BUSINESS" ]
    }
  }
}
```
