## Discussion

The `minPlayers` and `maxPlayers` attributes constrain the range of players in the match requests. If you don’t set the `GKMatchRequest.`[minPlayers](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/gkmatchrequest/minplayers) and `GKMatchRequest.`[maxPlayers](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/gkmatchrequest/maxplayers) properties in your code, the properties default to the rule set `minPlayers` and `maxPlayers` attributes. If you set the [GKMatchRequest](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/gkmatchrequest) properties, use values that are in the rule set range.

For example, if the match request range is `[2, 4]` and the rule set range is `[2,8]`, Game Center finds players within the `[2, 4]` match request range. However, if the match request range is `[2, 8]` and the rule set range is `[3, 4]`, Game Center ignores the match request properties and finds players within the `[3, 4]` rule set range. If the match request range is `[8, 8]` and the rule set range is `[2, 4]` (outside of the rule set range), Game Center never finds players for that request.
