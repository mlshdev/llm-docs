# Game Center blocked players

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** App Store Connect API  
**Kind:** API Collection

Block and unblock the Game Center players who can play your game.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Blocked players represent the Game Center players you block from playing a game. Blocking a player prevents that player from playing the game the Game Center detail belongs to, and unblocking reinstates access. Use this resource to:

- Read the players you block for a game.
- Block or unblock a player for a game.

> **Tip**

>  These endpoints require information from GameKit, specifically [gamePlayerID](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/gkplayer/gameplayerid).

A [GameCenterDetailPlayer](gamecenterdetailplayer.md) uses the player’s game-scoped ID as its resource ID.

For the equivalent workflow in App Store Connect, see [Manage scores and players](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/configure-game-center/manage-scores-and-players/).
