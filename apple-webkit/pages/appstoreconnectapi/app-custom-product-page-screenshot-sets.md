## Overview

An `appScreenshotSets` resource represents a set of screenshots that you intend to upload to App Store Connect. Create an appScreenshotSets resource as a container for all screenshots associated with a locale and display target, for example, screenshots for Simplified Chinese on an iPhone with a 6.5-inch display. Next, upload individual screenshots using the [App Screenshots](app-screenshots.md) resource.
