<a id="New-Features"></a>

### New Features

- Win-back offers can now be configured using [Win-back offers](win-back-offers.md). These are offers to bring back churned or expired customers to a subscription.  To learn more, see [Creating and configuring win-back offers](creating-and-configuring-win-back-offers.md).
- Developers can now use [Subscription images](subscription-images.md) and [In-app purchase images](in-app-purchase-images.md) endpoints to manage images for promoting subscriptions and in-app purchases.
- Age ratings for Australia and Korea can be read using [Read app info information](get-v1-appinfos-_id_.md).
- There are two new attributes available for age rating declarations. Use [Modify an age rating declaration](patch-v1-ageratingdeclarations-_id_.md) to set the attributes `lootbox` and `koreaAgeRatingOverride`, to learn more, see [AgeRatingDeclarationUpdateRequest.Data.Attributes](ageratingdeclarationupdaterequest/data-data.dictionary/attributes-data.dictionary.md).
- The `INSTALLS` report type now has a detailed and summary monthly option for [Download sales and trends reports](get-v1-salesreports.md).
- The [TerritoryAvailability.Attributes](territoryavailability/attributes-data.dictionary.md) resource now has two additional `contentStatuses` possible values, `ICP_NUMBER_MISSING` and `ICP_NUMBER_INVALID`. To learn more, see the “Availability in China mainland” section in [App Store Connect Help](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-information).
- Developers can now upload screenshots for Apple Watch Series 10, to learn more about possible values, see [ScreenshotDisplayType](screenshotdisplaytype.md).
- Developers can now add an app encryption declaration for a given app using [Create an app encryption declaration](post-v1-appencryptiondeclarations.md).

<a id="Improvements"></a>

### Improvements

- The OpenAPI specification ([downloadable here](https://developer.apple.com/sample-code/app-store-connect/app-store-connect-openapi-specification.zip)) values has improved `operationId` names and the Apple managed [Swift OpenAPI generator](https://github.com/apple/swift-openapi-generator) now produces more readable names for the App Store Connect API operations.
- [SubscriptionStatusUrlVersion](subscriptionstatusurlversion.md) normalized to all caps values such as `V1` and `V2`.
- The [List apps](get-v1-apps.md) resources now has more optional filters, including `reviewSubmissions.state`, `reviewSubmissions.platform`. The optional field `appAvailabilityV2` is also now available.
- The [Read app store version information](get-v1-appstoreversions-_id_.md) endpoint now includes `gameCenterAppVersions` fields.
- The [List all price points for a subscription](get-v1-subscriptions-_id_-pricepoints.md) endpoint now requires a `territory` filter.
- The `purchaseRequirement` attribute for [AppEvent.Attributes](appevent/attributes-data.dictionary.md) now correctly shows as a `string` type.

### Deprecations

- The `app` relationship to [Create an app encryption declaration](post-v1-appencryptiondeclarations.md) has been deprecated.
