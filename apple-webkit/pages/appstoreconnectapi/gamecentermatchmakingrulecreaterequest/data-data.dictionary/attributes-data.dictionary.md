- `expression` — `string` (required): Code that returns a Boolean or numeric value that the matchmaking rules algorithm executes to compare or filter match requests.
- `referenceName` — `string` (required): A name for the rule that’s unique within the scope of its rule set.
- `type` — `string` (required): The type or category of the rule that determines the return value and properties available in the expression.

## Discussion

The possible values for the `type` field are:

| `COMPATIBLE` | Rules that enforce constraints on two match requests and return a Boolean value.  ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi/spacer.png) For example, a rule that requires devices to run the same version of your game, or finds players that share a common language or game settings. ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi/spacer.png) If you set the `type` field to `COMPATIBLE`, compare the two match requests in the `requests` array in your expression, as in:  ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi/spacer.png) `areCompatibleAppVersions(requests[0], requests[1])` |
| --- | --- |
| `DISTANCE` | Rules that evaluate the similarity of two match requests and return a numeric value between `0.0` and `1.0`.  ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi/spacer.png) For example, rules that compare the latency or distance between players and find players with the exact same language and region setting. ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi/spacer.png) If you set the `type` field to `DISTANCE`, evaluate the two match requests in the `requests` array in your expression, as in: ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi/spacer.png) `geoLatency(requests[0], requests[1])` |
| `MATCH` | Rules that evaluate properties across all compatible requests.  ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi/spacer.png) For example, rules that prefer match candidates with more players but allows less players after a period of time, compare the difference in skill levels of players to a desired skill level that’s a function of time, and find players that have compatible game configurations that loosen over time. ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi/spacer.png) If you set the type field to `MATCH`, use the `requests` array in the expression to get all the compatible matches. |
| `TEAM` | Rules that evaluate the assignment of players to teams and return a Boolean value. ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi/spacer.png) For example, rules that make the number of players on each team the same, balance the skill levels on each team for a fair match, and keep invited friends on the same team. ![](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi/spacer.png) If you set the `type` field to `TEAM`, use the `teams` array to get all the teams associated with the rule set. |
