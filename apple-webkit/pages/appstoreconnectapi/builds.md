**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** App Store Connect API  
**Kind:** API Collection

Manage builds for testers and submit builds for review.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

A `builds` resource represents a single build of an app. You must upload builds using Xcode, Transporter, or the [Build uploads](build-uploads.md) resource. Once App Store Connect processes the build, it appears as a build resource.

Once the build is in the system, you can use the API to perform actions like:

- Submitting builds for review.
- Individually assigning builds to testers.
- Adding the build to a beta group for testing.

## Topics
