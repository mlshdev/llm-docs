## Overview

The `ciBuildRuns` resource represents an Xcode Cloud build. Use it to get a list of builds Xcode Cloud performed and access detailed information for a specific build; for example:

- The status of ongoing and completed builds
- The number of issues Xcode Cloud encountered during the build
- The build number
- Start and completion dates
- Actions Xcode Cloud performed

Additionally, use the `ciBuildRuns` resource to tell Xcode Cloud to start a new build.

> **Note**

>  This resource supports JSON web tokens with a lifetime of up to six months. For more information, see [Determine the Appropriate Token Lifetime](generating-tokens-for-api-requests.md#Determine-the-Appropriate-Token-Lifetime).
