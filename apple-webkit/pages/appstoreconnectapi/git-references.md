## Overview

The `scmGitReferences` resource represents the canonical Git reference for the Git commit that Xcode Cloud used to perform a build. The resource includes the following information:

- The reference’s name and canonical name
- Whether the reference has been deleted
- The type of the reference

For example, if Xcode Cloud uses the `bug-fix` branch for a build, the canonical Git reference is `refs/heads/bug-fix` and the name is `bug-fix`. If Xcode Cloud starts a build for the `release-1.0` tag, the canonical name is `refs/tags/release-1.0` and the name is `release-1.0`.

> **Note**

>  This resource supports JSON web tokens with a lifetime of up to six months. For more information, see [Determine the Appropriate Token Lifetime](generating-tokens-for-api-requests.md#Determine-the-Appropriate-Token-Lifetime).
