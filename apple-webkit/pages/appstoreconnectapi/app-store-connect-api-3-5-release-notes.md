### New Features

- Developers can optionally provide a single deep-link URL for a custom project page by adding a `deepLink` attribute to [AppCustomProductPageVersionCreateRequest.Data.Attributes](appcustomproductpageversioncreaterequest/data-data.dictionary/attributes-data.dictionary.md).

- Developers can now more easily debug slow-launch issues for their app with the new `LAUNCHES diagnosticType` for [List all diagnostic signatures for a build](get-v1-builds-_id_-diagnosticsignatures.md).
- Trending insights for disk writes signatures are now available and show the impact of signature trends across app versions. [List all diagnostic signatures for a build](get-v1-builds-_id_-diagnosticsignatures.md) now includes the `DiagnosticInsightDirection`, `DiagnosticInsightType`, and an impact breakdown by app version.
- A new attribute `BetaTesterState` is available for [BetaTester.Attributes](betatester/attributes-data.dictionary.md). For more information, see [View and manage tester information](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/test-a-beta-version/view-and-manage-tester-information).
