## Overview

An `appPreviewSets` resource represents a collection of app previews for an app locale and display target; for example, a set of screenshots for the Simplified Chinese listing of your app for an iPhone with a 6.5-inch display size. Use app preview sets to:

- Begin the process of uploading app previews.
- Reorder app previews after they’re uploaded.
- To upload individual previews, uses the [App Previews](app-previews.md) resource.

For more information about app previews, see [App information](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-information).
