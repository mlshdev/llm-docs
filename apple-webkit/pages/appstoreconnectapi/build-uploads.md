## Overview

Use this resource to upload and manage build uploads for your apps. Use the `BUILD_UPLOAD_STATE_UPDATED` webhook event type to get information about build upload status changes. To learn more, see [WebhookEventType](webhookeventtype.md).

The `buildUploads` resource represents the overall concept of the upload, whereas the `buildUploadFiles` resource represents the actual files that you upload. You can also use Xcode or Transporter to upload app binaries. To learn more, see [Transporter](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/transporter/id1450874784).

To read information about your builds after a successful upload, use the [Builds](builds.md) resource.
