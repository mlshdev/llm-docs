## Overview

The `perfPowerMetricsresource` resource is a read-only resource where you get the power and performance metrics and diagnostics for App Store versions of your app. Use this information to improve your app’s performance. Customers can opt-in to share this information with you on their devices.

A *metric* is a measurement of the power and performance impact of an app running on a device. The [MetricCategory](metriccategory.md) type lists the categories of measurements the system makes; for example, the `LAUNCH` metric measures how long it takes an app to present its first frame. Use the [Get power and performance metrics for an app](get-v1-apps-_id_-perfpowermetrics.md) and [Get power and performance metrics for a build](get-v1-builds-_id_-perfpowermetrics.md) endpoints to get the metrics reports for the most recent version of your app or for a specific build.

An *insight* is an automatically generated analysis that shows a trend based on a set of metrics data. Insights compare the performance of the most recent app version with previous versions. Look for insights in the response body object, [xcodeMetrics](xcodemetrics.md).

A *diagnostic signature* is a recurring pattern of function calls your app makes that are associated with a metric. To get a diagnostic log for a signature, first call the [List all diagnostic signatures for a build](get-v1-builds-_id_-diagnosticsignatures.md) endpoint to get the resource IDs for signatures you’re interested in. Then call [Download logs for a diagnostic signature](get-v1-diagnosticsignatures-_id_-logs.md) using the signature resource IDs to download the logs.

To learn more about power and performance metrics, see [About Metrics organizer](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/devb642b28ac), and `Improving Your App's Performance`.

## Topics

### Getting Metrics and Diagnostic Logs

- [Retrieve Power and Performance Metrics and Log Insights](retrieve-power-and-performance-metrics-and-log-insights.md): Use the App Store Connect API to collect and parse diagnostic logs and metrics for your apps.
- [Get power and performance metrics for an app](get-v1-apps-_id_-perfpowermetrics.md): Get the performance and power metrics data for the most recent version of an app.
- [Get power and performance metrics for a build](get-v1-builds-_id_-perfpowermetrics.md): Get the performance and power metrics data for a specific build.
- [List all diagnostic signatures for a build](get-v1-builds-_id_-diagnosticsignatures.md): List the aggregate backtrace signatures captured for a specific build.
- [Download logs for a diagnostic signature](get-v1-diagnosticsignatures-_id_-logs.md): Get the anonymized backtrace logs associated with a specific diagnostic signature.

### Objects and types

- [xcodeMetrics](xcodemetrics.md): A response that contains power and performance measurements for your app.
- [DiagnosticInsight](diagnosticinsight.md): An AI-generated analysis of a recurring performance issue identified in your app’s diagnostic logs, with suggested fixes.
- [DiagnosticSignaturesResponse](diagnosticsignaturesresponse.md): A response containing a list of unique performance issue signatures identified in your app’s diagnostic data.
- [DiagnosticSignature](diagnosticsignature.md): A unique pattern identifying a recurring crash, hang, or disk-write exception in your app’s diagnostic logs.
- [diagnosticLogs](diagnosticlogs.md): A response containing log data for a diagnostic signature.
- [DiagnosticLog](diagnosticlog.md): A raw performance log file associated with a diagnostic signature, downloadable for detailed analysis.
