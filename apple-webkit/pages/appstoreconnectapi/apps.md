# Apps

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** App Store Connect API  
**Kind:** API Collection

Manage your apps in App Store Connect.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

An `apps` resource represents your app that’s currently in development, or available on the App Store through the App Store Connect website. Use the `apps` resource to manage and maintain your existing apps.

Don’t use this API to create new apps; instead, create new apps on the App Store Connect website. To upload builds to App Store Connect, you must use Xcode, Transporter, or the Transporter Mac app. This API doesn’t permit you to directly upload your builds, but you may use App Store Connect API Keys in conjunction with Transporter to upload. To download the Transporter app, see the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/transporter/id1450874784?mt=12).

To learn more about managing your apps, see [Add a new app](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/create-an-app-record/add-a-new-app).
