### New Features

- To get the size usage of a background asset, reference the `usedBytes` attribute on [BackgroundAsset.Attributes](backgroundasset/attributes-data.dictionary.md).
- To specify the initial `gameCenterChallengeVersion` when creating a challenge, call [Create a Challenge](post-v1-gamecenterchallenges.md) using [GameCenterChallengeVersionInlineCreate](gamecenterchallengeversioninlinecreate.md).
- To specify the initial `gameCenterActivityVersion` when creating an activity, call [Create an Activity](post-v1-gamecenteractivities.md) using [GameCenterActivityVersionInlineCreate](gamecenteractivityversioninlinecreate.md). You can also specify a `fallbackUrl` for the initial activity version during the operation.
- Use the `preReleased` attribute with [Add a Player's Score](post-v1-gamecenterplayerachievementsubmissions.md) and [Add a Score to a Leaderbaord](post-v1-gamecenterleaderboardentrysubmissions.md) to indicate whether the requested change applies to the game’s release version or its prerelease version.
