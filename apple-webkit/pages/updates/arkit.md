<a id="General"></a>

### General

- Convert coordinates between SwiftUI, RealityKit and ARKit by getting a coordinate space for any tracked anchor with the new [ARKitCoordinateSpaceProviding](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arkitcoordinatespaceproviding) protocol, adopted by anchor types across ARKit.

<a id="visionOS"></a>

### visionOS

- Track how well an app’s content covers a person’s field of view, receive device fit updates, and present coaching alerts with [VisualFidelityProvider](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/visualfidelityprovider) and [FieldOfViewAnchor](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/fieldofviewanchor).
- Update the set of accessories a running [AccessoryTrackingProvider](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/accessorytrackingprovider) tracks without restarting the session using [updateAccessories(\_:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/accessorytrackingprovider/updateaccessories%28_:%29).
- Configure reference objects for high-frame-rate tracking with [ReferenceObject.Configuration](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/referenceobject/configuration).

<a id="iOS"></a>

### iOS

- Drive AR views from a rotation angle instead of a `UIInterfaceOrientation` with doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/arkit/arsession/viewrotationangle and the new orientation-independent variants on [ARCamera](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arcamera) and [ARFrame](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arframe).
- Attach an [ARSession](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arsession) to a specific `CALayer` with [viewLayer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arsession/viewlayer).
- Receive `AVFoundation` metadata objects, such as detected faces, alongside camera frames with [metadataObjects](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arframe/metadataobjects).
- Detect and track physical objects in world-tracking sessions with [trackingObjects](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arworldtrackingconfiguration/trackingobjects).
- Generate environment textures automatically with doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/arkit/arworldtrackingconfiguration/environmenttexturingenabled.

<a id="General"></a>

### General

- Bring ARKit to Mac apps by using [ARKitSession](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arkitsession) with [WorldTrackingProvider](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/worldtrackingprovider) to query device pose and manage world anchors on macOS.
- Classify surfaces consistently across plane, mesh, and room anchors using the unified [SurfaceClassification](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/surfaceclassification) enumeration.
- Opt into higher-fidelity hand data with doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/arkit/handanchor/fidelity.

<a id="Spatial-accessories"></a>

### Spatial accessories

- Track spatial accessories, such as styli, controllers, and purpose-built devices, with [AccessoryTrackingProvider](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/accessorytrackingprovider) and [AccessoryAnchor](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/accessoryanchor).
- Prepare an accessory for tracking by following [Preparing spatial accessories for tracking in your visionOS app](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/preparing-spatial-accessories-for-tracking-in-your-visionos-app) and adopt the workflow in [Tracking accessories in volumetric windows](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/tracking-accessories-in-volumetric-windows).

<a id="Shared-experiences"></a>

### Shared experiences

- Share a world coordinate space among nearby participants with [SharedCoordinateSpaceProvider](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/sharedcoordinatespaceprovider).
- Persist world anchors across nearby devices by opting in with [isSharedWithNearbyParticipants](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/worldanchor/issharedwithnearbyparticipants), and observe availability with [worldAnchorSharingAvailability](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/worldtrackingprovider/worldanchorsharingavailability-swift.property).

<a id="Camera"></a>

### Camera

- Capture from a defined region of space in enterprise apps with [CameraRegionProvider](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/cameraregionprovider) and [CameraRegionAnchor](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/cameraregionanchor).
- Access the right-eye camera feed and choose between mono- and stereo-corrected frames using [CameraFrameProvider.CameraPosition.right](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/cameraframeprovider/cameraposition/right) and [CameraFrameProvider.CameraRectification](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/cameraframeprovider/camerarectification).

<a id="June-2024"></a>

## June 2024

- Detect physical objects and attach digital content to them with [ObjectTrackingProvider](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/objecttrackingprovider).
- Use the [RoomTrackingProvider](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/roomtrackingprovider) to understand the shape and size of the room that people are in and detect when they enter a different room.
