Use [relateWorkoutEffortSample(\_:with:activity:completion:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkhealthstore/relateworkouteffortsample%28_:with:activity:completion:%29) to associate exertion data with a workout, and [HKWorkoutEffortRelationshipQuery](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkworkouteffortrelationshipquery) to query for associated exertion data.
- Access water temperature data from swimming workouts. Any Apple Watch Ultra records [waterTemperature](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkquantitytypeidentifier/watertemperature) samples during swimming workouts.
- Read and write mental well-being samples using the [HKStateOfMind](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkstateofmind), [HKPHQ9Assessment](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkphq9assessment), and [HKGAD7Assessment](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkgad7assessment) data types.

- Create custom, interval-based workouts. You can use either distance or time for the intervals, and sync the intervals to a group, such as a workout class.
- Mirror workout sessions in your iOS app. This includes the ability to control the workout session from the iOS app, and the ability to send data between the iOS and watchOS apps during an active workout session.
- Access batches of higher-rate motion data from Apple Watch. New Core Motion APIs provide 800 Hz accelerometer data and 200 Hz device motion data. Use this data to analyze someone’s motion after performing an action, like swinging a golf club.
- Measure time spent outdoors and average light intensity with new data types.
- Track cycling with new data types for tracking someone’s power, speed, cadence, and functional threshold power.
