### Camera facing direction

- Determine the direction a capture device faces in relation to a view, and get updated each time that direction changes, using [AVCaptureDeviceDirectionCoordinator](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avkit/avcapturedevicedirectioncoordinator).
- Create a coordinator with [init(view:deviceTypes:changeHandler:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avkit/avcapturedevicedirectioncoordinator/init%28view:devicetypes:changehandler:%29), specifying the view and the device types to monitor. Read [deviceDirections](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avkit/avcapturedevicedirectioncoordinator/devicedirections) for the current state, or supply a change handler to learn about later changes.
- Read the cameras that face the same direction as a view, and those that face away from it, from an [AVCaptureDeviceDirectionMap](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avkit/avcapturedevicedirectionmap) using its [forwardFacingDeviceDescriptors](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avkit/avcapturedevicedirectionmap/forwardfacingdevicedescriptors) and [backwardFacingDeviceDescriptors](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avkit/avcapturedevicedirectionmap/backwardfacingdevicedescriptors) properties.
- Identify a capture device from its sendable [AVCaptureDeviceDescriptor](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avkit/avcapturedevicedescriptor) representation, which exposes the device’s [deviceType](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avkit/avcapturedevicedescriptor/devicetype), [mediaTypes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avkit/avcapturedevicedescriptor/mediatypes), [position](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avkit/avcapturedevicedescriptor/position), [uniqueID](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avkit/avcapturedevicedescriptor/uniqueid), and [localizedName](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avkit/avcapturedevicedescriptor/localizedname), and match the unique identifier to get the actual [AVCaptureDevice](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturedevice).
