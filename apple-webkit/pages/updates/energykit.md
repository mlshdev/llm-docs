### Electric vehicle charging behavior

- Track and explain electric vehicle charging behavior with [ElectricVehicleStatusEvent](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/energykit/electricvehiclestatusevent), which provides discrete snapshots that capture why a vehicle isn’t charging when connected, when charging will begin, and why charging started or stopped.
- Use `ElectricVehicleChargingReason` to explain charging state transitions. The framework provides `ActiveReason` for reasons why charging starts or resumes, and `IdleReason` for reasons why the vehicle remains idle when connected to a charger.
- Define charging targets with [ElectricVehicleStatusEvent.ChargingTarget](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/energykit/electricvehiclestatusevent/chargingtarget-swift.struct) to show when charging begins and when it will complete, including the target charge, scheduled start time, and estimated completion time.

<a id="Device-identification"></a>

### Device identification

- Identify electrical load devices with type safety using [ElectricalLoadDevice](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/energykit/electricalloaddevice).
- Access device names through the [deviceName](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/energykit/electricvehicleloadevent/devicename) property for electric vehicles, and the [deviceName](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/energykit/electrichvacloadevent/devicename) property for HVAC devices.

<a id="Performance-metrics"></a>

### Performance metrics

- Estimate driving range and battery temperature to give more context about a charging session using [ElectricVehicleLoadEvent.ElectricalMeasurement.PerformanceMetrics](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/energykit/electricvehicleloadevent/electricalmeasurement/performancemetrics-swift.struct).

<a id="Home-app-integration"></a>

### Home app integration

- Display your app’s energy data in the Home app by adopting the [EnergyKit LoadEvents Entitlement](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com.apple.developer.energykit.loadevents-experience). The Home app automatically shows activity logs, historical charts, trend notifications, and whole-home energy usage based on your submitted events.
