### Security

- Test whether the peer executable that communicates with your app over an XPC connection has an expected entitlement by calling [xpc_connection_set_peer_entitlement_exists_requirement(\_:\_:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xpc/xpc_connection_set_peer_entitlement_exists_requirement%28_:_:%29), and whether it has a specific value for an entitlement by calling [xpc_connection_set_peer_entitlement_matches_value_requirement(\_:\_:\_:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xpc/xpc_connection_set_peer_entitlement_matches_value_requirement%28_:_:_:%29).
- Test whether the peer executable that communicates with your app over an XPC connection is an Apple platform binary with a given signing identifier by calling [xpc_connection_set_peer_platform_identity_requirement(\_:\_:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xpc/xpc_connection_set_peer_platform_identity_requirement%28_:_:%29).
- Test whether your Apple Developer team signed the peer executable that communicates with your app over an XPC connection by calling [xpc_connection_set_peer_team_identity_requirement(\_:\_:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xpc/xpc_connection_set_peer_team_identity_requirement%28_:_:%29).
- Test whether the peer executable that communicates with your app over an XPC connection satisfies a lightweight code requirement by calling [xpc_connection_set_peer_lightweight_code_requirement(\_:\_:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xpc/xpc_connection_set_peer_lightweight_code_requirement%28_:_:%29).

- Create XPC services using native Swift syntax. Use [XPCListener](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xpc/xpclistener) to create an XPC server that listens for messages from other processes. Use [XPCSession](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xpc/xpcsession) to create clients that connect to servers and exchange messages.
- For C and Objective-C projects, use the corresponding [xpc_listener_t](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xpc/xpc_listener_t) and [xpc_session_t](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xpc/xpc_session_t-10if0) APIs.
- In Xcode, use the updated XPC services target template to choose whether you want to use the high-level [NSXPCConnection](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsxpcconnection) or the low-level `libXPC` APIs.
