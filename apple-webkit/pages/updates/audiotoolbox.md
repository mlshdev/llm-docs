### Spatial audio with AUSpatialMixer

- Adjust the spatial mixer orientation to match someone’s head pose via compatible AirPods by setting the new [kAudioUnitProperty_SpatialMixerEnableHeadTracking](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/audiotoolbox/kaudiounitproperty_spatialmixerenableheadtracking) property to `true`. The system requires your app to have the [com.apple.developer.coremotion.head-pose](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com.apple.developer.coremotion.head-pose) entitlement to observe this property.
- Tailor spatial mixing output according to a person’s personalized spatial audio profile that they configure in Settings by adding the [com.apple.developer.spatial-audio.profile-access](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com.apple.developer.spatial-audio.profile-access) entitlement to your app.
- Instruct spatial mixing to ignore the new system spatial audio toggle in Control Center by adding the [AVGameBypassSystemSpatialAudio](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information-property-list/avgamebypasssystemspatialaudio) key to your app’s `Info.plist`.
