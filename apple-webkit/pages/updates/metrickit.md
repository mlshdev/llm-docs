### Metric manager

- Adopt [MetricManager](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metrickit/metricmanager) to receive metric and diagnostic reports through asynchronous sequences. `MetricManager` replaces [MXMetricManager](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metrickit/mxmetricmanager) and its subscriber protocol. For an overview of the MetricKit reporting model, see [Monitoring app performance with MetricKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metrickit/monitoring-app-performance-with-metrickit).
- Receive daily aggregated performance data through [MetricReport](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metrickit/metricreport), which conforms to `Codable` and `Sendable` for straightforward serialization and safe cross-actor use.
- Receive event-based diagnostic data through [DiagnosticReport](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metrickit/diagnosticreport). Handle each metric type using [MetricResult](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metrickit/metricresult). For information on working with metric values and diagnostic data in MetricKit reports, see [Analyzing app performance with MetricKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metrickit/analyzing-app-performance-with-metrickit).

<a id="State-contextualized-metrics"></a>

### State-contextualized metrics

- Use the [StateReporting](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/statereporting) framework with MetricKit to segment performance data by app-defined states in addition to intervals. For information on integrating the StateReporting framework with MetricKit, see [Getting started with StateReporting](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/statereporting/getting-started-with-statereporting).
