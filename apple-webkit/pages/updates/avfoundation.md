### Assets

- Preserve HDR data when generating images with `AVAssetImageGenerator` by setting the value of its [dynamicRangePolicy](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avassetimagegenerator/dynamicrangepolicy-swift.property) property to match the source video.
- Export media asynchronously using the [export(to:as:isolation:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avassetexportsession/export%28to:as:isolation:%29) method of [AVAssetExportSession](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avassetexportsession). You can monitor the progress of an export by calling the [states(updateInterval:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avassetexportsession/states%28updateinterval:%29) method and awaiting its results.
- Determine whether an [AVURLAsset](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avurlasset) decodes its data using a Media Extension by inspecting its [mediaExtensionProperties](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avurlasset/mediaextensionproperties) property.
