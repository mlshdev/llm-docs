## June 2026

- Section your query results by creating your query with a macro that takes a `sectionBy` parameter, as listed on the [Additional query macros](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftdata/additionalquerymacros) page.
- Use types that conform to [Codable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/codable) in a model, including types you don’t control directly, by using the  [codable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftdata/schema/attribute/option/codable) option for [Schema.Attribute](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftdata/schema/attribute).
- Receive real-time updates to models that match specified fetch criteria by using the [ResultsObserver](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftdata/resultsobserver) type.
- Observe remote model changes with the [HistoryObserver](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftdata/historyobserver) type.

- Increase the flexibility of your models by adopting inheritance through the [Model()](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftdata/model%28%29) macro.
- Gain added flexibility in accessing and sorting transaction history using [sortBy](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftdata/historydescriptor/sortby) in the [HistoryDescriptor](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftdata/historydescriptor).

<a id="Macros"></a>

### Macros

- Improve performance of sorts and predicate-based fetches by using the [Index(\_:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftdata/index%28_:%29-74ia2) macro to define individual and compound indexes.
- Define a unique constraint that includes one or more model attributes using the [Unique(\_:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftdata/unique%28_:%29) macro, enabling SwiftData to regard tuples of attributes as unique.
- Specify `nil` as a relationship’s `inverse` to create a unidirectional relationship.

<a id="Persistent-history"></a>

### Persistent history

- Fetch historical changes for one or more persistent models using the model context’s [fetchHistory(\_:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftdata/modelcontext/fetchhistory%28_:%29) method.
- Delete stale model history from a persistent store by calling the context’s [deleteHistory(\_:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftdata/modelcontext/deletehistory%28_:%29) method.
- Provide an alternate change tracking strategy for your custom persistent store by adopting the [HistoryProviding](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftdata/historyproviding) protocol.

<a id="Custom-persistent-stores"></a>

### Custom persistent stores

- Adopt the [DataStore](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftdata/datastore) protocol (and related protocols) to provide custom storage for your app’s persistent models.
