### Apple Intelligence

- Integrate your app with Apple intelligence by conforming your app intents, app entities, and app enums to an app schema in one of the [App schema domains](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/app-schema-domains).
- Indicate that your app entities have identifiers that remain stable across devices by adopting [SyncableEntity](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/syncableentity), so people can continue a task on another device.
- Prompt for confirmation before destructive or sensitive actions on shared or publicly accessible entities by adopting [OwnershipProvidingEntity](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/ownershipprovidingentity) and returning an [EntityOwnership](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/entityownership) value.
- Enable Apple Intelligence to suggest media-related entities like songs or albums during workouts and similar contexts with [RelevantEntities](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/relevantentities).
- Bridge your app entities to system intent value types by using [IntentValueRepresentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/intentvaluerepresentation) in your entity’s `transferRepresentation` property.

### App intents

- Let people perform App Shortcuts, custom shortcuts, system actions, or open another app from interactive widgets with [RunSystemShortcutIntent](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/runsystemshortcutintent).
- Extend an app intent’s background runtime by adopting [LongRunningIntent](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/longrunningintent) and calling [performBackgroundTask(options:operation:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/longrunningintent/performbackgroundtask%28options:operation:%29) with a [LongRunningTaskOptions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/longrunningtaskoptions) value, reporting progress as the task runs.
- Handle cancellation cleanup gracefully by adopting [CancellableIntent](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/cancellableintent). Inspect [IntentCancellationReason](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/intentcancellationreason) to distinguish a deliberate cancellation from a timeout.
- Reverse the effect of an app intent’s action by adopting [UndoableIntent](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/undoableintent).
- Specify whether your app intent runs in the foreground, the background, or both by setting the `supportedModes` property to an [IntentModes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/intentmodes) value, then consult [currentMode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/intentsystemcontext/currentmode) inside `perform()` to adapt your code at runtime.
- Tell the system which target may perform your app intent or entity query — the main app, the App Intents extension, or a widget extension — by setting the `allowedExecutionTargets` property to an [IntentExecutionTargets](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/intentexecutiontargets) option set.

<a id="App-entities"></a>

### App entities

- Refer to a large set of entities efficiently using [EntityCollection](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/entitycollection), which stores only entity identifiers and resolves the full [AppEntity](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/appentity) instances on demand. Use the type for an app intent parameter to avoid resolving every identifier during parameter resolution.
- Define union-type Shortcuts parameters with rich picker UI and custom metadata by adopting [AppUnionValue](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/appunionvalue) on the type the `@UnionValue` macro generates, along with the [AppUnionValueCasesProviding](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/appunionvaluecasesproviding) cases enum.
- Have the system retrieve indexed entities by identifier from the Spotlight index by adopting [IndexedEntityQuery](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/indexedentityquery).

<a id="Errors"></a>

### Errors

- Provide a localized description for failures by initializing an [AppIntentError](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/appintenterror) with `init(description:)`, or wrap an existing error that conforms to [CustomLocalizedStringResourceConvertible](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/customlocalizedstringresourceconvertible).

<a id="June-2025"></a>

## June 2025

- Create app intents that conform to [SnippetIntent](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/snippetintent) to display an interactive snippet.
- Make app entities available in Spotlight that conform to [IndexedEntity](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/indexedentity) and use the `@ComputedProperty(indexingKey:)` or `@Property(indexingKey:)` Swift macros for attributes you want to add to the Spotlight index.
- Integrate your app with visual intelligence by providing app entities to the system using an [IntentValueQuery](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/intentvaluequery).
- Create an [AppEntity](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/appentity) that conforms to the [Transferable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coretransferable/transferable) protocol and associate the app entity with a [NSUserActivity](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuseractivity) using the activity’s [appEntityIdentifier](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuseractivity/appentityidentifier) property to make onscreen content available to Siri without adopting an assistant schema.

<a id="Siri-and-Apple-Intelligence"></a>

### Siri and Apple Intelligence

- Make onscreen content available to Siri and Apple Intelligence by describing it as an [AppEntity](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/appentity) and adopting an assistant schema. Additionally, adopt the [Transferable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coretransferable/transferable) protocol, and associate the app entity with a [NSUserActivity](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuseractivity) using the activity’s [appEntityIdentifier](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuseractivity/appentityidentifier) property.

<a id="June-2024"></a>

## June 2024

<a id="System-integration"></a>

### System integration

- Integrate your app with Siri and Apple Intelligence using [App schema domains](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/app-schema-domains).
- Use [ControlConfigurationIntent](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/controlconfigurationintent) and [WidgetKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/widgetkit) to allow users to put controls on the Lock Screen or in Control Center.
- Create a locked camera capture extension for your app and implement a [CameraCaptureIntent](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/cameracaptureintent) to allow people to capture photos and videos from controls or the Action button.
- Create app intents that capture audio by implementing [AudioRecordingIntent](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/audiorecordingintent).
- Allow people to find app entities in Spotlight by adopting the [IndexedEntity](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/indexedentity) protocol.

<a id="Content-sharing"></a>

### Content sharing

- Make it possible to share and transfer data you describe as [App entities](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/app-entities) by conforming to [Transferable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coretransferable/transferable).
- Receive content other apps make available with app intents by using [IntentFile](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/intentfile) for your app intent parameters.
- Describe the file that stores your app intent data using [FileEntity](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/fileentity).

<a id="General"></a>

### General

- Provide additional information about errors with [AppIntentError.PermissionRequired](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/appintenterror/permissionrequired), [AppIntentError.Unrecoverable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/appintenterror/unrecoverable), and [AppIntentError.UserActionRequired](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/appintenterror/useractionrequired).
- Pass a condition to [requestConfirmation(conditions:actionName:dialog:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/appintent/requestconfirmation%28conditions:actionname:dialog:%29) to only require user confirmation if a person’s context meets the provided condition.
- Use [URLRepresentableIntent](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/urlrepresentableintent), [URLRepresentableEntity](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/urlrepresentableentity), and [URLRepresentableEnum](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/urlrepresentableenum) to represent your app intents, app entities, and app enums as universal links that you use to provide deep links to your app’s content.
- Define a set of types for an intent parameter using the [UnionValue()](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/unionvalue%28%29) macro to create flexible app intents because a parameter can be of one of several pre-defined union types.
- Create entities that have just one singular instance with [UniqueAppEntity](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/uniqueappentity) and the corresponding [UniqueAppEntityQuery](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/uniqueappentityquery). For example, to provide an app intent for app settings that appear in your app or in System Settings, create a singleton entity that encapsulates all settings as properties. Use it in the app intent that offers actions to change your app’s settings.
