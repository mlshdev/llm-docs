- Use fields on [ValidationResult](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/lightweightcoderequirements/validationresult) to find out whether a code file has a valid signature, and whether the signature satisfies your lightweight code requirement.
- Combine multiple [EntitlementsQuery](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/lightweightcoderequirements/entitlementsquery) constraints using the `anyOf` and `allOf` operators.
- Use the [Equatable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/equatable) protocol to compare instances of [LaunchCodeRequirement](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/lightweightcoderequirements/launchcoderequirement), [ProcessCodeRequirement](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/lightweightcoderequirements/processcoderequirement), and [OnDiskCodeRequirement](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/lightweightcoderequirements/ondiskcoderequirement).
- Use [SecCodeCheckValidityWithOnDiskRequirement(code:flags:requirement:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/lightweightcoderequirements/seccodecheckvaliditywithondiskrequirement%28code:flags:requirement:%29) to test a [SecCode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/seccode) instance using an on-disk code requirement.
- Use [SecCodeCheckValidityWithProcessRequirement(code:flags:requirement:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/lightweightcoderequirements/seccodecheckvaliditywithprocessrequirement%28code:flags:requirement:%29) to test a [SecCode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/seccode) instance using a process code requirement.
