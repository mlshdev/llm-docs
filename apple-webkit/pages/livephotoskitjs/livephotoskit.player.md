## Overview

This class provides a default native control allowing users to play Live Photos.

On a desktop browser, when the user moves the pointer over the native control badge, the video starts playing until the user moves the pointer away from the badge or the video ends. If the user moves the pointer before the video ends, the video stops.

On a mobile device, when the user presses the Live Photo, the video starts playing until the user stops pressing or the video ends.

### Player Events

During the life cycle of a player, several events are generated.  Adding an event listener to the player allows reaction to these events.

<a id="videoload"></a>

#### videoload

The player emits a `videoload` event after the video component of the Live Photo has finished loading but before the minimum number of frames necessary for smooth playback are decoded. Under normal circumstances, the `canplay` event is emitted after the `videoload` event. The event handler is then passed an `Event` object. The `Player` reference is accessible from the event’s target member.

```javascript
player.addEventListener('videoload', (ev) => {
    // Handle event.
})
```

<a id="photoload"></a>

#### photoload

The player emits a `photoload` event when the photo component of the Live Photo has finished loading. The event handler is then passed an `Event` object. The Player reference is accessible from the event’s target member.

```javascript
player.addEventListener('photoload', (ev) => {
    // Handle event.
})
```

<a id="canplay"></a>

#### canplay

The player emits a `canplay` event when the `Player` has obtained just enough video frames and is obtaining them quickly enough for smooth playback. The event handler is then passed an `Event` object. The Player reference is accessible from the event’s target member.

```javascript
player. addEventListener('canplay', (ev) => {
    // Handle event.
})
```

<a id="ended"></a>

#### ended

The player emits an `ended` event when playback of the Live Photo has completed. The event handler is then passed an `Event` object. The Player reference is accessible from the event’s target member.

```javascript
player.addEventListener('ended', (ev) => {
    // Handle event.
})
```

<a id="error"></a>

#### error

The player emits an `error` event when loading of either the photo or video components of the Live Photo has failed. The event handler is then passed an `Event` object, which has a detail member containing error information. If LivePhotosKit JS cannot interpret an internal exception, the `error` member of `detail` will be the exception object. The `Player` reference may be obtained from the event’s target member.

```javascript
player.addEventListener('error', (ev) => {
    if (typeof ev.detail.errorCode === 'number') {
        switch (ev.detail.errorCode) {
        case LivePhotosKit.Errors.IMAGE_FAILED_TO_LOAD:
            // Do something
            break;
        case LivePhotosKit.Errors.VIDEO_FAILED_TO_LOAD:
            // Do something
            break;
        }
    } else {
        // Extract Error object.
        console.error(ev.detail.error);
    }
})
```
