# video

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** LivePhotosKit JS  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** LivePhotosKit JS 1.3+

The playable `HTMLVideoElement` that the Player consumes to obtain video frame data to render to the screen while animating a Live Photo.

## Declaration

```
attribute HTMLVideoElement video;
```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

If this property is not populated by a playable `HTMLVideoElement`, the Player cannot play, but can still render as a photo if `photo` is populated.

You can get a value for this property in one of a few ways:

- Set [videoSrc](videosrc.md) to a string URL and wait for the resulting download and preparation to complete, at which point the property is populated with the resulting `HTMLVideoElement`.
- Set the [videoSrc](videosrc.md) to an `ArrayBuffer` and wait for the resulting preparation to complete, at which point the property is populated with the resulting `HTMLVideoElement`.
- Set the property directly to a fully playable `HTMLVideoElement` whose `canplay` event has fired.

Assigning this property directly causes [videoSrc](videosrc.md) to be cleared and set back to `null`. Moreover, if [videoSrc](videosrc.md) was recently assigned and a network request or asynchronous decoding is still happening, that activity is also canceled.
