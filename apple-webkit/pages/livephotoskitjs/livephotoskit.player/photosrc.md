# photoSrc

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** LivePhotosKit JS  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** LivePhotosKit JS 1.3+

The source of the photo component of the Live Photo.

## Declaration

```
attribute String,ArrayBuffer photoSrc;
```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

Set this property to three types of value:

- A String URL
- An `ArrayBuffer` instance that may already be available
- `null` (to clear the Player’s photo)

Changing this value causes the [photo](photo.md) property (the image consumed by the Player for rendering) to be initially set to `null`. If the new value assigned is a string URL or an `ArrayBuffer`, a round of loading and decoding activity begins, eventually resulting in the [photo](photo.md) property being populated with the newly loaded image. Only a string URL produces a network request as part of this loading process.

Changing this value while loading activity from a previous assignment is in progress causes the previous loading activity to abort.

Note: If, due to the architecture of your web app or web page, an already-loaded `Image` instance or fully painted canvas element is available, write it directly to the [photo](photo.md) property instead.

Declarative markup attribute: `data-photo-src`
