# videoRotation

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** LivePhotosKit JS  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** LivePhotosKit JS 1.3+

The angle that the video is displayed.

```
attribute Number videoRotation;
```

## Discussion

This property takes on a value of: 0, 90, 180, or 270, and is automatically determined as part of the video loading process.

A video might be provided in a different format, and that video is rotated in a way that the Player or the browser can’t compensate for. In this situation, you can manually assign a different value to correct the issue without having to rotate the source video.
