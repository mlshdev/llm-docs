# photoTime

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** LivePhotosKit JS  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** LivePhotosKit JS 1.0+

The nominated time, in seconds, of where the photo component should be within the Live Photo video component.

## Declaration

```
attribute Number photoTime;
```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

This is the timestamp, in seconds from the beginning of the provided video asset, at which the still photo was captured.

This value is required to properly play back the Live Photo; without it, the Player is unable to play.

The Player does its best to make getting this value populated as easy as possible. There are a few ways to provide this value:

- If you provide the video by assigning videoSrc, and you use the original QuickTime MOV captured by iPhone, this value will be discovered and populated automatically as part of the loading process.
- If you provide a URL or ArrayBuffer for the original QuickTime MOV to the metadataVideoSrc property, the asset will be loaded just far enough to provide this value automatically. Note that this is a convenience, and performance-critical uses may wish to avoid incurring the extra network request.
- Failing both of the above two options, the value for this photoTime property must be assigned manually.

Declarative markup attribute: `data-photo-time`
