## Discussion

This ensures that [wantsToPlay](wantstoplay.md) is `false`, meaning that if loading activity completes, playback will not begin spuriously.

If the Player is already not playing, then, aside from maintaining the [wantsToPlay](wantstoplay.md) value, this does nothing.

To resume playback, call the [play](play.md) or [toggle](toggle.md) method.

- [play](play.md): Starts playback if the player is ready, or resumes playback if the player is paused.
- [stop](stop.md): Stops playback and rewinds to the current time of zero.
