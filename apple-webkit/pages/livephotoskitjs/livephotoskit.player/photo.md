# photo

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** LivePhotosKit JS  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** LivePhotosKit JS 1.3+

The renderable, image-bearing DOM element (either an image or a canvas) that the Player consumes to render itself to the screen.

## Declaration

```
attribute HTMLImageElement,HTMLCanvasElement photo;
```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

If this property is not populated by an image or canvas, the Player cannot play or render.

You can provide a value for this property in one of several ways:

- Set [photoSrc](photosrc.md) to a string URL and wait for the resulting download and decode to complete, at which point the property is populated with the resulting image.
- Set [photoSrc](photosrc.md) to an `ArrayBuffer` and wait for the decode to complete, at which point the property is populated with the resulting image.
- Set the property directly to a fully loaded `HTMLImageElement` (such that its `complete` property is `true`).
- Set the property directly to an `HTMLCanvasElement` you have prepared, such that its backing store depicts the photo and that the photo is scaled properly.

Assigning this property directly causes [photoSrc](photosrc.md) to be cleared and set back to `null`. Moreover, if [photoSrc](photosrc.md) was recently assigned and a network request or asynchronous decoding is still happening; that activity is also canceled.
