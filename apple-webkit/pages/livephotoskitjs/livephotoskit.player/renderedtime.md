# renderedTime

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** LivePhotosKit JS  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** LivePhotosKit JS 1.3+

The current timestamp, as a floating-point number of seconds from the beginning of the animation, that is truly displayed on the screen.

## Declaration

```
readonly attribute Number renderedTime;
```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

If [currentTime](currenttime.md) is set to a value for which the required video frames are not yet available, `renderedTime` remains at its current value until the video frames are acquired. At that point, the Player is re-rendered, and `renderedTime` is updated to once again reflect [currentTime](currenttime.md).
