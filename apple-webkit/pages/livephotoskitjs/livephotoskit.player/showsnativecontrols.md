# showsNativeControls

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** LivePhotosKit JS  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** LivePhotosKit JS 1.3+

The value of this property indicates whether the Apple-provided playback controls are enabled for the user.

## Declaration

```
attribute Boolean showsNativeControls;
```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

Assigning this property changes the visibility of the controls.

If the value of this property is `false`, playback is controllable only by directly invoking `play`, `pause`, and so on. To invoke these controls, you need to add custom event listeners.

Declarative markup attribute: `data-shows-native-controls`
