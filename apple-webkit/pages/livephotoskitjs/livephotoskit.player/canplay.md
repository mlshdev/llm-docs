# canPlay

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** LivePhotosKit JS  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** LivePhotosKit JS 1.3+

A Boolean value that indicates whether the Player is able to begin playback.

## Declaration

```
readonly attribute Boolean canPlay;
```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

Even if this property is `false`, playback can be initiated by calling [play](play.md) or (if [showsNativeControls](showsnativecontrols.md) is `true`) positioning the pointer over the LIVE badge.  When playback is attempted, if this value is `false`, every effort is made to load the rest of the required resources.  When successful, playback starts.
