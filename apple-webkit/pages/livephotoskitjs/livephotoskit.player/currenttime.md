# currentTime

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** LivePhotosKit JS  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** LivePhotosKit JS 1.0+

The current time, in seconds, of the play head.

## Declaration

```
readonly attribute Number currentTime;
```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

Setting this property moves the play head synchronously to the specified time.

Allowable values are floating points between `0` and [duration](duration.md). A value that places the play head between frames shows a weighted average of the two frames.

If the playback style is [FULL](../livephotoskit.playbackstyle/full.md) a value of `0` corresponds to the at-rest view of the full-resolution photo. As `currentTime` increases, the Live Photo animation will be played back according to the playback style.

Because the required frames might not be decoded, setting `currentTime` could fail. In this case, `currentTime` will not take on its just-assigned value. Setting `currentTime` again to the same value in the near future will most likely succeed. There is no asynchronous callback to test for when the missing requirements for a particular `currentTime` value become available.
