## Discussion

This property can take one of two values:

- `LivePhotosKit.PlaybackStyle.FULL`
- `LivePhotosKit.PlaybackStyle.HINT`

`FULL` refers to the full-featured Live Photo animation consisting of a brief animation forward from the photo. This is followed by a fade transition to the beginning of the video and a subsequent full play through before transitioning back to the photo.

`HINT` refers to a shortened animation that simply plays forward from the photo through the end of the video, before transitioning back to the photo.
