# photoMimeType

**Interface language:** Data

The MIME type of a photo asset.

## Declaration

```
attribute String photoMimeType;
```

## Discussion

The `MIME` type is either as detected from a network request for the asset (if the `MIME` type was provided as a URL on [photoSrc](photosrc.md)) or as provided by the developer prior to assigning a prepared `ArrayBuffer` to [photoSrc](photosrc.md).

This property, while writable, behaves as read-only if the photo was obtained through a network request to a string URL set on [photoSrc](photosrc.md). In this case, writes to this property are ignored.

However, if the intent is to assign an already loaded `ArrayBuffer` to [photoSrc](photosrc.md), you must set this property to the correct MIME type beforehand. This type is usually `image/jpeg`, but can vary if you provide a different image format. In that case, the property defaults to the value `image/jpeg`.
