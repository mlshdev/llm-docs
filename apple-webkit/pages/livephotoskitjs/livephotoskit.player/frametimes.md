# frameTimes

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** LivePhotosKit JS  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** LivePhotosKit JS 1.3+

An array of timestamps for each second from the beginning of a Live Photo for which the frames reside in the Live Photo.

## Declaration

```
attribute Number[],string frameTimes;
```

## Discussion

The frameTimes array allows the Player to crossfade between video frames during playback.

This value is required to properly play the Live Photo; without it, the Player cannot play.

The player does its best to make it as easy as possible to populate this value. There are a few ways to provide it:

- Assign [videoSrc](videosrc.md), and use any MPEG-4 or MOV file.  The value is read from the video and populated automatically as part of the loading process.
- Provide a URL or `ArrayBuffer` for the original QuickTime MOV to the [metadataVideoSrc](metadatavideosrc.md) property. The asset is loaded just far enough to provide the value automatically. Note that this is a convenience, and for performance-critical uses, you may wish to avoid incurring the extra network request.
- If neither of the previous options works, assign the value manually. You can assign it as either an array of floating-point numbers or as a comma-delimited string of decimal values.
