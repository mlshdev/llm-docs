# NewSubmissionRequest

**Interface language:** Data

**Framework:** Notary API  
**Kind:** Object  
**Availability:** Notary API 2.0.0+

Data that you provide when starting a submission to the notary service.

## Declaration

```
object NewSubmissionRequest
```

## Properties

- `notifications` — `[NewSubmissionRequest.Notifications]`: An optional array of notifications that you want to receive when notarization finishes. Omit this key if you don’t need a notification.
- `sha256` — `string` (required): A cryptographic hash of the software that you want to notarize, computed using Secure Hashing Algorithm 2 (SHA-2) with a 256-bit digest. Supply the hash as a string of 64 hexadecimal digits. You must compute the hash from the exact version of the software that you plan to upload to Amazon S3.
  **Allowed values:** `/[A-Fa-f0-9]{64}/`
- `submissionName` — `string` (required): The name of the file that you plan to submit. The service includes this name in its responses when you ask for the status of a submission, get a list of previous submissions, or get a log file corresponding to a submission. The file name doesn’t have to be unique among all your submissions, but making it so might help you to distinguish among submissions in service responses.
