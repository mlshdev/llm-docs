## Discussion

Use this endpoint to tell the notary service about a new software submission that you want to make. Do this when you want to notarize a new version of your software.

You provide an HTTP body that contains a name for the submission, a hash of the software that you plan to submit, and an optional webhook that the service uses to notify you when notarization completes. For the name, use the name of the file that you upload, including the `dmg` or `zip` extension. The service responds with temporary security credentials that you use to submit the software to Amazon S3 and a submission identifier that you use to track the submission’s status.

After uploading your software, you can use the identifier to ask the notary service for the status of your submission using the [Get Submission Status](get-submission-status.md) endpoint. If you lose the identifier, you can get a list of your team’s 100 most recent submissions using the [Get Previous Submissions](get-previous-submissions.md) endpoint. After notarization completes, use the [Get Submission Log](get-submission-log.md) to get details about the outcome of notarization. Do this even if notarization succeeds, because the log might contain warnings that you can fix before your next submission.
