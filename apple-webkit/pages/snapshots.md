## Overview

Use the Maps Web Snapshots service to generate static map images from a URL. You can use Snapshots any time that an interactive map isn’t required, and in any place you typically use an image URL — in web pages, and in places where JavaScript isn’t available, such as email clients.

> **Note**

>  If you need an interactive map on the web, see [MapKit JS](mapkitjs.md). To generate static map snapshots in iOS, macOS, or tvOS apps, see [MKMapSnapshotter](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkit/mkmapsnapshotter).

To learn how to construct a signed and validated snapshot URL, see [Generating a URL and Signature to Create a Maps Web Snapshot](snapshots/generating-a-url-and-signature-to-create-a-maps-web-snapshot.md). You generate the required signature using credentials obtained through your Apple Developer account. See [Creating a Maps identifier and a private key](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applemapsserverapi/creating-a-maps-identifier-and-a-private-key) to learn how to get these credentials. You can also obtain HTML to show information about a place using [Create a Map](https://developer.apple.com/maps/create-a-map/).

For more information on usage limits for Maps Web Snapshots, see the Apple Developer page, [Maps on the Web](https://developer.apple.com/maps/web/).
