## Overview

Throughout the [W3C Payment Request API specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/), properties and attributes with the type `object` contain specific data related to payment methods. When using Apple Pay, keep in mind that these properties and attributes with the type `object` have a concrete type.

To indicate that data is specific to Apple Pay, set the [supportedMethods](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/#dom-paymentmethoddata-supportedmethods) property of the W3C [PaymentMethodData](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/#paymentmethoddata-dictionary) dictionary and W3C [PaymentDetailsModifier](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/#paymentdetailsmodifier-dictionary) dictionary to the Apple Pay URL `https://apple.com/apple-pay`.

Set up the payment request by setting the [data](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/#dom-paymentmethoddata-data) property of the W3C [PaymentMethodData](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/#paymentmethoddata-dictionary) dictionary to an [ApplePayRequest](applepayrequest.md) dictionary. The following is an example of an [ApplePayRequest](applepayrequest.md) dictionary that requires Apple Pay Version 12:

```javascript
let applePayPaymentMethodData = {
    supportedMethods: "https://apple.com/apple-pay",
    data: {
        version: 12,
        // Add additional ApplePayRequest attributes here.
    },
};
```

Customize the payment request by setting the [data](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/#dom-paymentdetailsmodifier-data) property of the W3C [PaymentDetailsModifier](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/#paymentdetailsmodifier-dictionary) dictionary to an [ApplePayModifier](applepaymodifier.md) dictionary. The following is an example of an [ApplePayModifier](applepaymodifier.md) dictionary that only applies to credit cards:

```javascript
let applePayPaymentDetailsModifier = {
    supportedMethods: "https://apple.com/apple-pay",
    data: {
        paymentMethodType: "credit",
        // Add additional ApplePayModifier attributes here.
    },
};
```

Handle changes made by the user to features specific to Apple Pay by looking at the [methodDetails](paymentmethodchangeevent/methoddetails.md) attribute of the W3C [PaymentMethodChangeEvent](paymentmethodchangeevent.md):

- If the user changes the payment method type, the [methodDetails](paymentmethodchangeevent/methoddetails.md) attribute is an [ApplePayPaymentMethod](applepaypaymentmethod.md) dictionary.
- If the user changes the coupon code, the [methodDetails](paymentmethodchangeevent/methoddetails.md) attribute is an [ApplePayCouponCodeDetails](applepaycouponcodedetails.md) dictionary.

The following is an example of how to differentiate these different scenarios when handling a W3C [PaymentMethodChangeEvent](paymentmethodchangeevent.md):

```javascript
paymentRequest.addEventListener("paymentmethodchange", function(event) {
    if (event.methodName === "https://apple.com/apple-pay") {
        if (event.methodDetails.couponCode) {
            let applePayCouponCodeDetails = event.methodDetails;
            // Handle coupon code updates here.
            return;
        }

        let applePayPaymentMethodDetails = event.methodDetails;
        if (applePayPaymentMethodDetails.type === "credit") {
            // Handle credit payment method type changes here.
        } else {
            // Handle other payment method type changes here.
        }
    }
});
```

Explain issues by creating custom error messages using an array of [ApplePayError](applepayerror.md) objects:

- If the user makes any problematic changes, set the [paymentMethodErrors](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/#dom-paymentdetailsupdate-paymentmethoderrors) property of the W3C [PaymentDetailsUpdate](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/#paymentdetailsupdate-dictionary) dictionary.
- If a problem occurs during authorization, set the [paymentMethod](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/#dom-paymentvalidationerrors-paymentmethod) property of the W3C [PaymentValidationErrors](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/#dom-paymentvalidationerrors) dictionary.

The following is an example of how to show custom error messages if the user inputs an invalid coupon code or shipping postal code:

```javascript
paymentRequest.addEventListener("shippingaddresschange", function(event) {
    if (event.methodName === "https://apple.com/apple-pay") {
        if (event.methodDetails.couponCode) {
            let applePayCouponCodeDetails = event.methodDetails;
            if (!isValidCouponCode(applePayCouponCodeDetails.couponCode) {
                event.updateWith({
                    paymentMethodErrors: [
                        new ApplePayError("couponCodeInvalid", undefined, "Coupon code is invalid"),
                    ],
                });
                return;
            }

            // Handle valid coupon code updates here.
            return;
        }

        let applePayPaymentMethodDetails = event.methodDetails;
        if (applePayPaymentMethodDetails.type === "credit") {
            // Handle credit payment method type changes here.
        } else {
            // Handle other payment method type changes here.
        }
    }
});

paymentRequest.show().then(function(paymentResponse) {
    if (paymentResponse.methodName === "https://apple.com/apple-pay") {
        if (!hasValidShippingZIPCode(paymentResponse)) {
            paymentResponse.retry({
                paymentMethod: [
                    new ApplePayError("shippingContactInvalid", "postalCode", "ZIP Code is invalid"),
                ],
            });
            return;
        }

        // Handle authorization with valid details here.
    }
});

```

Get the payment information after the user authorizes the payment request by looking at the [details](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/#dom-paymentresponse-details) attribute of the W3C [PaymentResponse](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/#paymentresponse-interface), which is an [ApplePayPayment](applepaypayment.md) dictionary. The following example accesses the [postalCode](applepaypaymentcontact/postalcode.md) after authorization:

```javascript
function hasValidShippingZIPCode(paymentResponse) {
    if (paymentResponse.methodName === "https://apple.com/apple-pay") {
        let applePayPayment = paymentResponse.details;
        let shippingZIPCode = applePayPayment.shippingContact.postalCode;
        // Validate shipping ZIP code here.
    }
}
```
