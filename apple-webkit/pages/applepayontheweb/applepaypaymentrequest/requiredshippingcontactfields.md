## Discussion

Use `requiredShippingContactFields` to request the user’s address and other contact information that you require to fulfill the order.

You will receive the customer’s name when you request `postalAddress`. If you don’t need the customer’s address, you can request the `name` contact field directly.

The following listing is an example of requesting fields for a shipping contact:

```javascript
"requiredShippingContactFields": [
    "postalAddress",
    "name",
    "phoneticName",
    "phone",
    "email"
]
```

The source of the information may be the user’s “My card” in Contacts, Wallet settings, or may be entered into the payment sheet by the user, either directly or through Contacts.
