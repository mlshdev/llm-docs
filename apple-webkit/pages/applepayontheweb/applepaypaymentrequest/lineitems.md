## Discussion

See [ApplePayLineItem](../applepaylineitem.md).

Use [lineItems](lineitems.md) to explain additional charges, discounts, and pending costs. Provide the total separately, in the [total](total.md) property. Line items aren’t required in a [ApplePayPaymentRequest](../applepaypaymentrequest.md), but can’t be empty if they’re present.

The following listing shows line items that include a subtotal, free shipping, and estimated tax.

```javascript
"lineItems": [
    {
        "label": "Bag Subtotal",
        "type": "final",
        "amount": "35.00"
    },
    {
        "label": "Free Shipping",
        "amount": "0.00",
        "type": "final"
    },
    {
        "label": "Estimated Tax",
        "amount": "3.06",
        "type": "final"
    }
]
```

The resulting payment sheet looks like:
