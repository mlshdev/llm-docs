## Discussion

Set the value to `storePickup` for an in-store or other pickup to prevent the user from editing the shipping address.

Add `postalAddress` to `requiredShippingContactFields` to display the pickup address. Set the `shippingContact` to the pickup address.

```javascript
let applePayPaymentRequest = {
    // Set the shipping type.
    shippingType: "storePickup",

    // Set the required shipping contact fields to display the pickup address.
    requiredShippingContactFields: [
        "postalAddress"
    ],

    // Set the shipping contact to the pickup location.
    shippingContact: {
        addressLines: ["123 Any Street"],
        locality: "Any Town",
        administrativeArea: "CA",
        postalCode: "95014",
        countryCode: "US",
        familyName: "COMPANY, INC."
    },

    // Set the shipping contact information to read-only.
    shippingContactEditingMode: "storePickup",

    countryCode: "US",
    currencyCode: "USD",
    merchantCapabilities: ["supports3DS"],
    supportedNetworks: ["visa", "masterCard"],
    total: { label: "COMPANY, INC.", amount: "10.00" }
};
```

> **Note**

>  Determine whether to disable editing of the shipping contact field before displaying the payment sheet. Switching from a noneditable to an editable shipping contact field requires the user to start the payment process over again.
