## Overview

When specifying a range using date components, provide all elements of the [ApplePayDateComponents](applepaydatecomponents.md) down to the level of granularity that you want to expose. For example, if you specify a range of days, be sure to include values for both [months](applepaydatecomponents/months.md) and [years](applepaydatecomponents/years.md) in addition to [days](applepaydatecomponents/days.md) in the [ApplePayDateComponents](applepaydatecomponents.md).

[Apple Pay on the Web](../applepayontheweb.md) uses the Gregorian calendar when processing dates.
