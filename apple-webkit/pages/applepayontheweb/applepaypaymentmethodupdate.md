## Overview

If a user changes their payment method on the payment sheet, you respond by updating the payment request details in [ApplePayPaymentMethodUpdate](applepaypaymentmethodupdate.md).

You must provide an updated total for the transaction in the `newTotal` line item. You can optionally provide updated line items if the change to the payment method changes the line items.
