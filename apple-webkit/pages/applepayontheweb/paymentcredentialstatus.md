## Overview

The following are possible return values:

- **`paymentCredentialsAvailable`**: Confirms that the device supports Apple Pay and there’s at least one active payment credential in Wallet that qualifies for payments on the web. Show an Apple Pay button and offer Apple Pay as the primary, but not necessarily sole, payment option.
- **`paymentCredentialStatusUnknown`**: Confirms that the device supports Apple Pay, but the Wallet information is unknown. Show an Apple Pay button and offer Apple Pay as a possible payment option.
- **`paymentCredentialsUnavailable`**: Confirms that the device supports Apple Pay and that the device doesn’t have any active payment credentials in Wallet. Offer Apple Pay as a payment option, but don’t make it the sole or default payment option. This gives people the option to set up Apple Pay as part of their purchase.
