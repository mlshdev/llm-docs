## Discussion

Use this attribute to request and return a merchant session. You must set this attribute to the following function:

```javascript
session.onvalidatemerchant = function(event) {}
```

where `event` is an [ApplePayValidateMerchantEvent](../applepayvalidatemerchantevent.md) object.

The process to complete the merchant validation is as follows:

1. Your [onvalidatemerchant](onvalidatemerchant.md) function calls your server, and passes it the static hostname `apple-pay-gateway.apple.com` as the validation URL. In the China region, use `cn-apple-pay-gateway.apple.com`.
2. Your server uses the validation URL to request a session from the Apple Pay server, as described in [Requesting an Apple Pay payment session](../requesting-an-apple-pay-payment-session.md).
3. In response, your server receives an opaque merchant session object, `MerchantSession`.
4. You pass the merchant session object to the completion method, [completeMerchantValidation](completemerchantvalidation.md).

The system enables the payment sheet.

> **Note**

>  Previous merchant validation instructions stated that your [onvalidatemerchant](onvalidatemerchant.md) function must call your server and pass it the URL from the event’s [validationURL](../applepayvalidatemerchantevent/validationurl.md) attribute. Apple Pay continues to support this flow for existing implementations.
