An event handler to call when the user selects a shipping method.

```
attribute EventHandler onshippingmethodselected;
```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

This attribute must be set to a function that accepts an `events` argument; for example, `session.onshippingmethodselected = function(event) {}`.

The event parameter contains the [shippingMethod](../applepayshippingmethodselectedevent/shippingmethod.md) attribute.

The [onshippingmethodselected](onshippingmethodselected.md) function must respond by calling [completeShippingMethodSelection](completeshippingmethodselection.md) before the 30 second timeout, after which a message appears stating that the payment could not be completed.
