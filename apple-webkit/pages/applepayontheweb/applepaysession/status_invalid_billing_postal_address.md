## Discussion

Use this status code only for Apple Pay API version 1 or 2  calls. For version 3, use an [ApplePayError](../applepayerror.md) with a status of [STATUS_FAILURE](status_failure.md)  and error code instead.

Use this status code if your address validation determines that the billing address is invalid. The payment sheet remains open and shows the billing address highlighted in red.
