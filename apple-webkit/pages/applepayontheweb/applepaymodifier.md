## Overview

This dictionary contains the supported Apple Pay properties for the `PaymentDetailsModifier` `data` object in the [Payment Request API](payment-request-api.md). For more information about `PaymentDetailsModifier`, see the [W3C Payment Request API specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/#paymentdetailsmodifier-dictionary).

In the Payment Request API, modifiers contain transaction details that apply only under certain conditions. For example, you can create a modifier that adds a surcharge for paying with a credit card. Each transaction contains the modifier details, but the payment sheet only displays the surcharge if the user chooses to pay with a credit card.

In Apple Pay, define display items using an [ApplePayModifier](applepaymodifier.md) based on the user’s choice of payment method type: `"credit"`, `"debit"`, `"prepaid"`, or `"store"`. When the user selects their payment method, the transaction displays the information on the payment sheet based on the modifier corresponding to the payment method. To create a modifier that works with all payment types, don’t include the [paymentMethodType](applepaymodifier/paymentmethodtype.md) attribute.

The following example shows a modifier that applies to the `credit` payment type that changes the total to $15, adds a $5 “Surcharge” line item, and adds a shipping method with an estimated delivery of 3 to 5 days:

```javascript
let shippingStart = new Date;
shippingStart.setDate(shippingStart.getDate() + 3);

let shippingEnd = new Date;
shippingEnd.setDate(shippingEnd.getDate() + 5);

let modifiers = [
    {
        supportedMethods: "https://apple.com/apple-pay",
        data: {
            paymentMethodType: "credit",
            total: {
                label: "Total",
                amount: "15.00",
            },
            additionalLineItems: [
                {
                    label: "Surcharge",
                    amount: "5.00",
                },
            ],
            additionalShippingMethods: [
                {
                    amount: "0.00",
                    dateComponentsRange: {
                        startDateComponents: {
                            year: shippingStart.getFullYear(),
                            months: shippingStart.getMonth() + 1,
                            days: shippingStart.getDate(),
                        },
                        endDateComponents: {
                            year: shippingEnd.getFullYear(),
                            months: shippingEnd.getMonth() + 1,
                            days: shippingEnd.getDate(),
                        },
                    },
                    detail: "Tickets sent to your address",
                    identifier: "delivery",
                    label: "Delivery",
                },
            ],
        },
    },
];
```

Applying the modifier overwrites the total in the payment request when the modifier also includes a total.

> **Important**

>  The payment sheet displays data only. You’re responsible for supplying all values, including calculating new totals that result from using a modifier.

<a id="Providing-multiple-modifiers"></a>

### Providing multiple modifiers

To provide an Apple Pay modifier that applies to all payment methods, include an [ApplePayModifier](applepaymodifier.md) with no [paymentMethodType](applepaymodifier/paymentmethodtype.md) specified. However, if this modifier appears first in an array of modifiers, the payment request always uses it, and ignores the subsequent Apple Pay modifiers.

If you provide multiple Apple Pay modifiers for the same [paymentMethodType](applepaymodifier/paymentmethodtype.md), such as multiple modifiers for a `"credit"` payment method type, Apple Pay uses only the first [ApplePayModifier](applepaymodifier.md) for that payment method. Apple Pay ignores the remaining modifiers with a `"credit"` payment method type.

<a id="Requesting-optional-payment-types"></a>

### Requesting optional payment types

A typical payment request is for a one-time payment. To support different types of payment requests, include one of the following options in the [ApplePayModifier](applepaymodifier.md):

- The [recurringPaymentRequest](applepaymodifier/recurringpaymentrequest.md) property to request a recurring payment.
- The [automaticReloadPaymentRequest](applepaymodifier/automaticreloadpaymentrequest.md) property to set up automatic reload payments.
- The [multiTokenContexts](applepaymodifier/multitokencontexts.md) property to request multiple payment tokens to support multimerchant payments.

> **Note**

>  You can set only one of these optional payment type properties in the [ApplePayModifier](applepaymodifier.md).

<a id="Requesting-a-recurring-payment"></a>

### Requesting a recurring payment

Use the [recurringPaymentRequest](applepaymodifier/recurringpaymentrequest.md) property to set up a recurring payment request in the [ApplePayModifier](applepaymodifier.md). Recurring payments, such as subscriptions, can feature different payment intervals (for example, annually or monthly), and billing cycles (for example, regular or trial).

<a id="Requesting-automatic-reload-payments"></a>

### Requesting automatic reload payments

Use the [automaticReloadPaymentRequest](applepaymodifier/automaticreloadpaymentrequest.md) property to set up an automatic reload payment in the [ApplePayModifier](applepaymodifier.md). You can set up automatic reload payments, such as store card top-ups, that feature a balance threshold and a reload amount. The card automatically reloads with the reload amount when the account drops below the balance threshold.

<a id="Requesting-multitoken-or-multimerchant-payments"></a>

### Requesting multitoken or multimerchant payments

Use the [multiTokenContexts](applepaymodifier/multitokencontexts.md) property to set up payment data for multimerchant payments in the [ApplePayModifier](applepaymodifier.md). You can set up multitoken transactions to process and display payment requests with multiple merchants on one payment sheet, for example, a booking site where a user pays for a hotel, flight, and car rental from different merchants.
