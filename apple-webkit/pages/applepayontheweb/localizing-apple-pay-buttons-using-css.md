## Overview

You can set the language of Apple Pay buttons by setting the `-webkit-locale` CSS property or the `lang` HTML attribute. For example, to display the Buy with Apple Pay button with the text in French, you can use code like this:

`<button lang="fr" style="-webkit-appearance: -apple-pay-button; -apple-pay-button-type: buy;"></button>`

Localization applies to all Apple Pay buttons with text, including Set up Apple Pay, Buy with Apple Pay, and Donate with Apple Pay.

Localizing Apple Pay buttons is available starting in macOS 10.12.1 and iOS 10.1.
