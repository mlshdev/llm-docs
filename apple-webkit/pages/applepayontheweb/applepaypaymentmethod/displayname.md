## Discussion

The display name enables a user to recognize a particular card from a list of cards.

For debit and credit cards, the display name often includes the card brand and the last four digits of the credit card number when available, for example: `“Visa 1233”`, `“MasterCard 5678”`, `“AmEx 9876”`. For Apple Pay Cash cards, the display name is `“Apple Pay Cash”`. However, there is no guarantee about the display name’s content or format.

To protect the user’s privacy, Apple Pay sets the display name only after the user authorizes the purchase.
