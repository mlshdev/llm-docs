## Overview

Use an [ApplePayPaymentRequest](applepaypaymentrequest.md) dictionary to represent a merchant request for payment for goods or services. Your website creates a payment request as soon as the user taps the Apple Pay button to make a purchase.

A payment request contains information that describes the purchase, such as the merchant information, supported payment networks, and the line items, including the total, the currency code, the billing and shipping contact, and more.

A typical payment request is for a one-time payment. To support different types of payment requests, provide one of the following options in the payment request:

- A [recurringPaymentRequest](applepaypaymentrequest/recurringpaymentrequest.md) object to request a recurring payment. Recurring payments, such as subscriptions, can feature different payment intervals (for example, annually or monthly), and either regular or trial billing cycles.
- An [automaticReloadPaymentRequest](applepaypaymentrequest/automaticreloadpaymentrequest.md) object to set up automatic reload payments. Automatic reload payments, such as store card top-ups, feature a balance threshold and a reload amount. The card automatically reloads with the reload amount when the account drops below the balance threshold.
- Use the [deferredPaymentRequest](applepaypaymentrequest/deferredpaymentrequest.md) property to set up a deferred payment request using the [ApplePayDeferredPaymentRequest](applepaydeferredpaymentrequest.md) class. Deferred payments include purchases, such as hotel bookings or pre-orders, where the card renders payment at a later date upon the receipt of goods or delivery of services.
- Use the [applePayLaterAvailability](applepayrequestbase/applepaylateravailability.md) property to indicate whether this payment request is eligible for Apple Pay Later. You can indicate that Apple Pay Later is unavailable for certain kinds of transactions, including subscriptions, items that require recurring payments or prohibited items, such as gift cards.
- A [multiTokenContexts](applepaypaymentrequest/multitokencontexts.md) sequence to request multiple payment tokens to support multimerchant payments. Set up multitoken transactions to process and display payment requests with multiple merchants on one payment sheet, for example, a booking site where a user pays for a hotel, flight, and car rental from different merchants.

> **Note**

>  You can set only one of these optional payment request type properties on a payment request object.

For recurring payments and automatic reload payments, you can optionally set up merchant token life-cycle notifications for the request. For more information, see [Apple Pay Merchant Token Management API](../merchanttokennotificationservices.md).
