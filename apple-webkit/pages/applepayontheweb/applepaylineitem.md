## Overview

Line items appear in the payment sheet.

The following code is an example of a line item for a $20 charge that recurs every six months starting on 01/01/2022 and ending on 01/01/2024:

```javascript
{
    "label": "Subscription",
    "amount": "20.00",
    "type": "final",
    "paymentTiming": "recurring",
    "recurringPaymentStartDate": new Date("2022-01-01T00:00:00"),
    "recurringPaymentIntervalUnit": "month",
    "recurringPaymentIntervalCount": 6,
    "recurringPaymentEndDate": new Date("2024-01-01T00:00:00"),
}
```

The following code is an example of a line item for a deferred charge of $50 on 07/01/2023:

```javascript
{
    "label": "After Trial Period",
    "amount": "50.00",
    "type": "final",
    "paymentTiming": "deferred",
    "deferredPaymentDate": new Date("2023-07-01T00:00:00"),
}
```
