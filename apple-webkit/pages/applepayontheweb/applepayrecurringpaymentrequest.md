## Overview

> **Important**

>  You must include the [recurringPaymentRequest](applepaypaymentrequest/recurringpaymentrequest.md) property in the [ApplePayPaymentRequest](applepaypaymentrequest.md) object to specify a request for a recurring payment.

Use an [ApplePayRecurringPaymentRequest](applepayrecurringpaymentrequest.md) object to provide the user with payment details and a way to manage payment methods for a recurring payment. You can optionally display a billing agreement and set up merchant token life-cycle notifications for the request.

For more information about the merchant token life-cycle notifications, see [Apple Pay Merchant Token Management API](../merchanttokennotificationservices.md).
