**Kind:** Article

Validate your merchant identity and receive a session object for each payment request.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

As soon as the system displays the payment sheet, the Apple Pay JS API calls your session object’s [onvalidatemerchant](applepaysession/onvalidatemerchant.md) event handler to verify that the request is coming from a valid merchant. It passes the function an [ApplePayValidateMerchantEvent](applepayvalidatemerchantevent.md) object that contains the validation URL.

> **Important**

>  The URL you receive can vary, so always use the URL provided in the [validationURL](applepayvalidatemerchantevent/validationurl.md) property. Your server must provide allow-listed access to all the validation URLs, specified in [Setting Up Your Server](setting-up-your-server.md).

In your [onvalidatemerchant](applepaysession/onvalidatemerchant.md) function:

1. You call your server, passing it the URL from the event’s [validationURL](applepayvalidatemerchantevent/validationurl.md) property.
2. Your server uses the validation URL to request a session from the Apple Pay server, as described in [Requesting an Apple Pay payment session](requesting-an-apple-pay-payment-session.md). Never send the request for a merchant session from the client.
3. In response, your server receives an opaque merchant session object.
4. You pass the merchant session object to your Apple Pay session’s [completeMerchantValidation](applepaysession/completemerchantvalidation.md) method. You can use the merchant session object a single time. It expires five minutes after it is created.
