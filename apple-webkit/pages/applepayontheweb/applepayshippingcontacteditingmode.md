## Overview

The values for the contact editing mode:

- **`“available”`**: The user can edit the shipping contact on the payment sheet.
- **“`enabled`” (deprecated)**: The user can edit the shipping contact on the payment sheet.
- **`“storePickup”`**: The user can’t edit the shipping contact on the payment sheet.

> **Important**

>  Previous versions of the Apple Pay JS API accepted `enabled` rather than `available` as a parameter for the `ApplePayShippingContactEditingMode`. Developers should upgrade their code to use `available`.\`\`
