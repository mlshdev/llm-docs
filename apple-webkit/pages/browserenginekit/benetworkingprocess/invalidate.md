## Discussion

The system halts the networking process for your browser app when you call this function. In platform versions earlier than iOS 18, the system marks the networking process as no longer in use, and might stop it at a later time to free its resources. The system doesn’t call the interruption handler that you passed when you launched the extension.

After you call this method, other method calls on the networking process throw errors.
