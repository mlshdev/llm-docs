# commit() (Swift)

**Framework:** BrowserEngineKit  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 17.4+ · iPadOS 17.4+

Notifies the render server to coordinate transactions for the added views and layer hierarchies.

## Declaration

```swift
@MainActor func commit()
```

## Mentioned In

- [Hosting browser view layers in the rendering extension](../hosting-browser-view-layers-in-the-rendering-extension.md)

<a id="discussion"></a>

## Discussion

In all processes that share a transaction coordinator instance, call this method as the last interaction with the instance.

Before calling this method:

- Add the relevant views and layer hierarchies to the transaction coordinator.
- Share the coordinator between processes.
- Perform the necessary transactions.

Use the instance only once; after you call this method, discard the instance.

> **Note**

> This method synchronizes changes committed in [CATransaction](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore/catransaction) objects that affect the added views and layer hierarchies; it doesn’t commit the transactions.
>
> Call [commit()](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore/catransaction/commit%28%29) on each relevant transaction.
