# scrollView(\_:handle:completion:) (Swift)

**Framework:** BrowserEngineKit  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 17.4+ · iPadOS 17.4+ · tvOS 17.4+ · visionOS 1.1+

Handles a scroll update before the scroll view reacts to it.

## Declaration

```swift
optional func scrollView(_ scrollView: BEScrollView, handle scrollUpdate: BEScrollViewScrollUpdate, completion: @escaping (Bool) -> Void)
```

```swift
optional func scrollView(_ scrollView: BEScrollView, handle scrollUpdate: BEScrollViewScrollUpdate) async -> Bool
```

## Parameters

- `scrollView`: The [BEScrollView](../bescrollview.md) that receives the scroll update.
- `scrollUpdate`: An object that describes the scroll update. Retrieve all information from this object immediately on the main queue when the system calls your delegate method, as the values may change.
- `completion`: A block to call when you finish processing the scroll update. Pass `true` if you handled the scroll event and the scroll view doesn’t need to react to it; pass `false` otherwise.

## Discussion

Your `BEScrollViewDelegate` receives scroll updates before its delegating scroll view handles them. The system calls this method on the main queue — retrieve information from `scrollUpdate` on the main queue, then process the update asynchronously. Call the `completion` block asynchronously on the main queue when you finish processing.

> **Important**

>  Call completion blocks on the main queue in the same order in which you receive scroll updates.
