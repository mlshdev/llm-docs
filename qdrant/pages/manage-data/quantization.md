# Quantization

Quantization is an optional feature in Qdrant that enables efficient storage and search of high-dimensional vectors.
By transforming original vectors into new representations, quantization compresses data while preserving close to original relative distances between vectors.
Different quantization methods have different mechanics and tradeoffs. We will cover them in this section.

Quantization is primarily used to reduce the memory footprint and accelerate the search process in high-dimensional vector spaces.
In the context of Qdrant, quantization allows you to optimize the search engine for specific use cases, striking a balance between accuracy, storage efficiency, and search speed.

There are tradeoffs associated with quantization.
On the one hand, quantization allows for significant reductions in storage requirements and faster search times.
This can be particularly beneficial in large-scale applications where minimizing the use of resources is a top priority.
On the other hand, quantization introduces an approximation error, which can lead to a slight decrease in search quality.
The level of this tradeoff depends on the quantization method and its parameters, as well as the characteristics of the data.

Qdrant supports four quantization methods:

- **[TurboQuant](#turboquant-quantization)** supports up to 32x compression, with strong recall across most embedding models.
- **[Scalar Quantization](#scalar-quantization)** compresses each vector component from a 32-bit float to an 8-bit integer, achieving 4x compression with minimal accuracy loss.
- **[Binary Quantization](#binary-quantization)** reduces each vector component to one to two bits for up to 32x compression. Best suited for high-dimensional, centered vector distributions.
- **[Product Quantization](#product-quantization)** enables up to 64x compression when minimizing memory is the top priority.

To help you choose the right quantization method for your use case, refer to the [next section](#how-to-choose-the-right-quantization-method).

## How to Choose the Right Quantization Method

Depending on your requirements for recall, compression, and distance metrics, consult this table for guidance:

| Compression | Method                                                                                                                        |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 4           | Use **Scalar Quantization**. It is a well-established quantization method with a good balance between recall and compression. |

However, unless you need to use the Manhattan (L1) distance metric, consider using 4-bit **TurboQuant** instead of scalar quantization, as it offers comparable recall at double the compression. |
\| 8           | Use 4-bit **TurboQuant**. It offers a good balance between recall and compression.

When using the Manhattan (L1) distance metric, consider using another quantization method. |
\| 16          | **2-bit TurboQuant** and **2-bit binary quantization** offer similar results at this compression level. Binary quantization is faster, but TurboQuant provides better recall. |
\| 24          | **1.5-bit TurboQuant** and **1.5-bit binary quantization** offer similar results at this compression level. Binary quantization is faster, but TurboQuant provides better recall. |
\| 32          | **1-bit TurboQuant** and **1-bit binary quantization** offer similar results at this compression level. Binary quantization is faster, but TurboQuant provides better recall. |
\| Up to 64  | Use **Product Quantization** if the memory footprint is the top priority and accuracy and speed are not critical. |

## TurboQuant Quantization

*Available as of v1.18.0*

> **Note**
>
> Test TurboQuant on your data before committing. We encourage you to try it on new collections.

TurboQuant is [a quantization method developed by Google](https://research.google/blog/turboquant-redefining-ai-efficiency-with-extreme-compression/). It operates by applying a fast random rotation to vectors before compression, which evenly redistributes data across coordinates. This allows applying a single pre-computed, globally optimized quantization mapping across the dataset, enabling TurboQuant to work effectively with any vector distribution and overcoming a key limitation found in binary quantization.

[Qdrant's implementation of TurboQuant](https://qdrant.tech/articles/turboquant-quantization/) extends the original algorithm to close the gap between the algorithm's theoretical assumptions and real-world embeddings.

TurboQuant uses asymmetric quantization automatically: only stored vectors are compressed, while queries are scored in full precision. This improves accuracy and requires no additional configuration.

### Encoding Options

TurboQuant supports four bit depths:

| Encoding          | Bit Depth | Compression |
| ----------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| `bits4` (default) | 4 bits    | 8×          |
| `bits2`           | 2 bits    | 16×         |
| `bits1_5`         | 1.5 bits  | 24×         |
| `bits1`           | 1 bit     | 32×         |

In our benchmarks, 4-bit TurboQuant, at twice the compression ratio of scalar quantization, delivers similar recall and speed. Results vary by dataset and embedding model: it may outperform or slightly underperform scalar quantization. This makes 4-bit TurboQuant a good default choice for many use cases.

Compared to binary quantization, TurboQuant offers better recall at lower speed and equivalent storage budgets.

The default encoding is `bits4`, which offers the best accuracy.

### Distance Metric Support

TurboQuant fully supports Cosine, Dot, and Euclidean (L2) distance with SIMD-accelerated scoring.

Manhattan (L1) distance is supported but requires full vector reconstruction per comparison, making it significantly slower than the other metrics. Use Cosine, Dot, or Euclidean distance for best performance with TurboQuant.

## Scalar Quantization

*Available as of v1.1.0*

[Scalar quantization](https://qdrant.tech/articles/scalar-quantization/), in the context of vector search engines, is a compression technique that compresses vectors by reducing the number of bits used to represent each vector component.

For instance, Qdrant uses 32-bit floating numbers to represent the original vector components. Scalar quantization allows you to reduce the number of bits used to 8.
In other words, Qdrant performs `float32 -> uint8` conversion for each vector component.
Effectively, this means that the amount of memory required to store a vector is reduced by a factor of 4.

In addition to reducing the memory footprint, scalar quantization also speeds up the search process.
Qdrant uses a special SIMD CPU instruction to perform fast vector comparison.
This instruction works with 8-bit integers, so the conversion to `uint8` allows Qdrant to perform the comparison faster.

The main drawback of scalar quantization is the loss of accuracy. The `float32 -> uint8` conversion introduces an error that can lead to a slight decrease in search quality.
However, this error is usually negligible, and tends to be less significant for high-dimensional vectors.
In our experiments, we found that the error introduced by scalar quantization is usually less than 1%.

However, this value depends on the data and the quantization parameters.
Please refer to the [Quantization Tips](#quantization-tips) section for more information on how to optimize the quantization parameters for your use case.

## Binary Quantization

*Available as of v1.5.0*

[Binary quantization](https://qdrant.tech/articles/binary-quantization/) is an extreme case of scalar quantization.
This feature lets you represent each vector component as a single bit, effectively reducing the memory footprint by a factor of 32. This is the fastest quantization method, since it lets you perform a vector comparison with a few CPU instructions. Binary quantization can achieve up to a 40x speedup compared to the original vectors.

However, binary quantization is only efficient for high-dimensional vectors and requires a centered distribution of vector components.

At the moment, binary quantization shows good accuracy results with the following models:

- OpenAI `text-embedding-ada-002` - 1536d tested with [dbpedia dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/KShivendu/dbpedia-entities-openai-1M) achieving 0.98 recall\@100 with 4x oversampling
- Cohere AI `embed-english-v2.0` - 4096d tested on Wikipedia embeddings - 0.98 recall\@50 with 2x oversampling

Models with a lower dimensionality or a different distribution of vector components may require additional experiments to find the optimal quantization parameters.

We recommend using binary quantization only with rescoring enabled, as this can significantly improve search quality. However, keep in mind that if the original vectors are stored on disk, rescoring can significantly decrease search speed.

Additionally, oversampling can be used to tune the tradeoff between search speed and search quality at query time.

### Binary Quantization as Hamming Distance

The additional benefit of this method is that you can efficiently emulate Hamming distance with dot product.

Specifically, if original vectors contain `{-1, 1}` as possible values, then the dot product of two vectors is equal to the Hamming distance by simply replacing `-1` with `0` and `1` with `1`.

**<b>Sample truth table</b>**

| Vector 1 | Vector 2 | Dot product |
| -------- | -------- | ----------- |
| 1        | 1        | 1           |
| 1        | -1       | -1          |
| -1       | 1        | -1          |
| -1       | -1       | 1           |

| Vector 1 | Vector 2 | Hamming distance |
| -------- | -------- | ---------------- |
| 1        | 1        | 0                |
| 1        | 0        | 1                |
| 0        | 1        | 1                |
| 0        | 0        | 0                |

As you can see, both functions are equal up to a constant factor, which makes similarity search equivalent.
Binary quantization makes it efficient to compare vectors using this representation.

### 1.5-Bit and 2-Bit Quantization

*Available as of v1.15.0*

**Binary quantization** storage can use **2 and 1.5 bits** per dimension, improving precision for smaller vectors. One-bit compression resulted in significant data loss and precision drops for vectors smaller than a thousand dimensions, often requiring expensive rescoring. 2-bit quantization offers 16X compression compared to 32X with one bit, improving performance for smaller vector dimensions. The 1.5-bit quantization compression offers 24X compression and intermediate accuracy.

A major limitation of binary quantization is poor handling of values close to zero.
2-bit quantization addresses this by explicitly representing zeros using an efficient scoring mechanism. In the case of 1.5-bit quantization, the zero-bit is shared between two values, balancing the efficiency of binary quantization with the accuracy improvements of 2-bit quantization, especially when 2-bit BQ requires too much memory.

In order to build 2-bit representation, Qdrant computes values distribution and then assigns bit values to 3 possible buckets:

- `-1` - 00
- `0` - 01
- `1` - 11

1.5-bit quantization is similar, but it merges buckets of element pairs into binary triplets.

![2-bit quantization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qdrant/landing_page/3b58061329eedce2091c9dd380b8c47fcaa1cb64/qdrant-landing/static/docs/2-bit-quantization.png)

*Binary quantization at 1, 1.5 and 2 bits per dimension.*

See how to set up 1.5-bit and 2-bit quantization in the [following section](#set-up-bit-depth).

### Asymmetric Quantization

*Available as of v1.15.0*

The **Asymmetric Quantization** technique allows Qdrant to use different vector encoding algorithms for stored vectors and queries.
A particularly interesting combination is binary stored vectors and Scalar quantized queries.
With a binary query, every dimension contributes the same ±1 vote to the score, even where the query component is close to zero and its sign is mostly noise.
A scalar-quantized query keeps the magnitude of each component, so each dimension's contribution stays close to the exact float32 value.

![Asymmetric quantization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qdrant/landing_page/3b58061329eedce2091c9dd380b8c47fcaa1cb64/qdrant-landing/static/docs/asymmetric-quantization.png)

*Asymmetric quantization: a binary stored vector scored against a binary and a scalar-quantized query.*

This approach maintains storage size and RAM usage similar to binary quantization while offering improved precision. It is beneficial for memory-constrained deployments, or where the bottleneck is disk I/O rather than CPU.
This is particularly useful for indexing millions of vectors as it improves precision without sacrificing much because the limitation in such scenarios is disk speed, not CPU. This approach requires less rescoring for the same quality output.

See how to set up Asymmetric Quantization in the [following section](#set-up-asymmetric-quantization)

## Product Quantization

*Available as of v1.2.0*

[Product quantization](https://qdrant.tech/articles/product-quantization/) is a method of compressing vectors to minimize their memory usage by dividing them into
chunks and quantizing each segment individually.
Each chunk is approximated by a centroid index that represents the original vector component.
The positions of the centroids are determined through the utilization of a clustering algorithm such as k-means.
For now, Qdrant uses only 256 centroids, so each centroid index can be represented by a single byte.

Product quantization can compress by a more prominent factor than a scalar one.
But there are some tradeoffs. Product quantization distance calculations are not SIMD-friendly, so it is slower than scalar quantization.
Also, product quantization has a loss of accuracy, so it is recommended to use it only for high-dimensional vectors.

Please refer to the [Quantization Tips](#quantization-tips) section for more information on how to optimize the quantization parameters for your use case.

## Setting Up Quantization in Qdrant

You can configure quantization for a collection by specifying the quantization parameters in the `quantization_config` section of the collection configuration.

Quantization will be automatically applied to all vectors during the indexation process.
Quantized vectors are stored alongside the original vectors in the collection, so you will still have access to the original vectors if you need them.

*Available as of v1.1.1*

The `quantization_config` can also be set on a per vector basis by specifying it in a named vector.

### Setting Up TurboQuant

To enable TurboQuant, specify it in the `quantization_config` section of the collection configuration.

When enabling TurboQuant on an existing collection, use a PATCH request or the corresponding `update_collection` method and omit the vector configuration, as it's already defined.

	}),
	QuantizationConfig: qdrant.NewQuantizationTurbo(
		&qdrant.TurboQuantization{
			Memory: qdrant.Memory_Pinned.Enum(),
		},
	),
})
```

`bits` - the encoding bit depth. Defaults to `bits4`. Available values: `bits4`, `bits2`, `bits1_5`, and `bits1`. Lower bit depths offer higher compression at the cost of accuracy.

`memory` - the [memory tier](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/ops-configuration/memory-tiers/) for the quantized vectors. By default, depends on the placement of the original vectors. See [Default Tiers](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/ops-configuration/memory-tiers/#default-tiers). Set to `pinned` to always keep quantized vectors in RAM. If you're using a version older than 1.19, see [Legacy Settings](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/ops-configuration/memory-tiers/#legacy-settings).

### Setting Up Scalar Quantization

To enable scalar quantization, you need to specify the quantization parameters in the `quantization_config` section of the collection configuration.

When enabling scalar quantization on an existing collection, use a PATCH request or the corresponding `update_collection` method and omit the vector configuration, as it's already defined.

**Http**

```http
PUT /collections/{collection_name}
{
    "vectors": {
      "size": 768,
      "distance": "Cosine"
    },
    "quantization_config": {
        "scalar": {
            "type": "int8",
            "quantile": 0.99,
            "memory": "pinned"
        }
    }
}
```

**Python**

```python
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient, models

client.create_collection(
    collection_name="{collection_name}",
    vectors_config=models.VectorParams(size=768, distance=models.Distance.COSINE),
    quantization_config=models.ScalarQuantization(
        scalar=models.ScalarQuantizationConfig(
            type=models.ScalarType.INT8,
            quantile=0.99,
            memory=models.Memory.PINNED,
        ),
    ),
)
```

**Typescript**

```typescript
import { QdrantClient } from "@qdrant/js-client-rest";

client.createCollection("{collection_name}", {
  vectors: {
    size: 768,
    distance: "Cosine",
  },
  quantization_config: {
    scalar: {
      type: "int8",
      quantile: 0.99,
      memory: "pinned",
    },
  },
});
```

**Rust**

```rust

**Csharp**

 {
  Scalar = new ScalarQuantization
  {
   Type = QuantizationType.Int8,
   Quantile = 0.99f,
   Memory = Memory.Pinned
  }
 }
);
```

**Go**

```go
import (
	"context"

	"github.com/qdrant/go-client/qdrant"
)

client.CreateCollection(context.Background(), &qdrant.CreateCollection{
	CollectionName: "{collection_name}",
	VectorsConfig: qdrant.NewVectorsConfig(&qdrant.VectorParams{
		Size:     768,
		Distance: qdrant.Distance_Cosine,
	}),
	QuantizationConfig: qdrant.NewQuantizationScalar(
		&qdrant.ScalarQuantization{
            Type:     qdrant.QuantizationType_Int8,
			Quantile: qdrant.PtrOf(float32(0.99)),
			Memory:   qdrant.Memory_Pinned.Enum(),
		},
	),
})
```

There are 3 parameters that you can specify in the `quantization_config` section:

`type` - the type of the quantized vector components. Currently, Qdrant supports only `int8`.

`quantile` - the quantile of the quantized vector components.
The quantile is used to calculate the quantization bounds.
For instance, if you specify `0.99` as the quantile, 1% of extreme values will be excluded from the quantization bounds.

Using quantiles lower than `1.0` might be useful if there are outliers in your vector components.
This parameter only affects the resulting precision and not the memory footprint.
It might be worth tuning this parameter if you experience a significant decrease in search quality.

`memory` - the [memory tier](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/ops-configuration/memory-tiers/) for the quantized vectors. By default, depends on the placement of the original vectors. See [Default Tiers](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/ops-configuration/memory-tiers/#default-tiers).
However, in some setups you might want to keep quantized vectors in RAM to speed up the search process. If you're using a version older than 1.19, see [Legacy Settings](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/ops-configuration/memory-tiers/#legacy-settings).

In this case, you can set `memory` to `pinned` to always keep quantized vectors in RAM.

### Setting Up Binary Quantization

To enable binary quantization, you need to specify the quantization parameters in the `quantization_config` section of the collection configuration.

When enabling binary quantization on an existing collection, use a PATCH request or the corresponding `update_collection` method and omit the vector configuration, as it's already defined.

**Http**

```http
PUT /collections/{collection_name}
{
    "vectors": {
      "size": 1536,
      "distance": "Cosine"
    },
    "quantization_config": {
        "binary": {
            "memory": "pinned"
        }
    }
}
```

**Python**

```python
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient, models

client.create_collection(
    collection_name="{collection_name}",
    vectors_config=models.VectorParams(size=1536, distance=models.Distance.COSINE),
    quantization_config=models.BinaryQuantization(
        binary=models.BinaryQuantizationConfig(
            memory=models.Memory.PINNED,
        ),
    ),
)
```

**Typescript**

```typescript
import { QdrantClient } from "@qdrant/js-client-rest";

client.createCollection("{collection_name}", {
  vectors: {
    size: 1536,
    distance: "Cosine",
  },
  quantization_config: {
    binary: {
      memory: "pinned",
    },
  },
});
```

**Rust**

```rust
use qdrant_client::qdrant::{
    BinaryQuantizationBuilder, CreateCollectionBuilder, Distance, Memory, VectorParamsBuilder,
};
use qdrant_client::Qdrant;

client
    .create_collection(
        CreateCollectionBuilder::new("{collection_name}")
            .vectors_config(VectorParamsBuilder::new(1536, Distance::Cosine))
            .quantization_config(
                BinaryQuantizationBuilder::default().memory(Memory::Pinned),
            ),
    )
    .await?;
```

	}),
	QuantizationConfig: qdrant.NewQuantizationBinary(
		&qdrant.BinaryQuantization{
			Memory: qdrant.Memory_Pinned.Enum(),
		},
	),
})
```

`memory` - the [memory tier](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/ops-configuration/memory-tiers/) for the quantized vectors. By default, depends on the placement of the original vectors. See [Default Tiers](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/ops-configuration/memory-tiers/#default-tiers).

In this case, you can set `memory` to `pinned` to always keep quantized vectors in RAM.

#### Set Up Bit Depth

To enable 2bit or 1.5bit quantization, you need to specify `encoding` parameter in the `quantization_config` section of the collection configuration. Available values are `two_bits` and `one_and_half_bits`.

**Http**

```http
PUT /collections/{collection_name}
{
    "vectors": {
      "size": 1536,
      "distance": "Cosine"
    },
    "quantization_config": {
        "binary": {
            "encoding": "two_bits",
            "memory": "pinned"
        }
    }
}
```

**Python**

```python
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient, models

client.create_collection(
    collection_name="{collection_name}",
    vectors_config=models.VectorParams(size=1536, distance=models.Distance.COSINE),
    quantization_config=models.BinaryQuantization(
        binary=models.BinaryQuantizationConfig(
            encoding=models.BinaryQuantizationEncoding.TWO_BITS,
            memory=models.Memory.PINNED,
        ),
    ),
)
```

**Typescript**

```typescript
import { QdrantClient } from "@qdrant/js-client-rest";

client.createCollection("{collection_name}", {
  vectors: {
    size: 1536,
    distance: "Cosine",
  },
  quantization_config: {
    binary: {

            Memory: qdrant.Memory_Pinned.Enum(),
        },
    ),
})
```

#### Set Up Asymmetric Quantization

To enable asymmetric quantization, you need to specify `query_encoding` parameter in the `quantization_config` section of the collection configuration. Available values are:

- `default` and `binary` - use regular binary quantization for the query.
- `scalar8bits` - use 8bit quantization for the query.
- `scalar4bits` - use 4bit quantization for the query.

**Http**

```http
PUT /collections/{collection_name}
{
    "vectors": {
      "size": 1536,
      "distance": "Cosine"
    },
    "quantization_config": {
        "binary": {

### Setting Up Product Quantization

To enable product quantization, you need to specify the quantization parameters in the `quantization_config` section of the collection configuration.

When enabling product quantization on an existing collection, use a PATCH request or the corresponding `update_collection` method and omit the vector configuration, as it's already defined.

**Http**

```http
PUT /collections/{collection_name}
{
    "vectors": {
      "size": 768,
      "distance": "Cosine"
    },
    "quantization_config": {
        "product": {
            "compression": "x16",
            "memory": "pinned"
        }
    }
}
```

**Python**

```python
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient, models

    collection_name="{collection_name}",
    vectors_config=models.VectorParams(size=768, distance=models.Distance.COSINE),

            memory=models.Memory.PINNED,
        ),
    ),
)
```

**Typescript**

```typescript

**Csharp**

```csharp

using Qdrant.Client.Grpc;

await client.CreateCollectionAsync(

 quantizationConfig: new QuantizationConfig
 {
  Product = new ProductQuantization { Compression = CompressionRatio.X16, Memory = Memory.Pinned }
 }
);
```

**Go**

```go
import (
	"context"

	"github.com/qdrant/go-client/qdrant"
)

client.CreateCollection(context.Background(), &qdrant.CreateCollection{
	CollectionName: "{collection_name}",
	VectorsConfig: qdrant.NewVectorsConfig(&qdrant.VectorParams{
		Size:     768,

	}),
	QuantizationConfig: qdrant.NewQuantizationProduct(
		&qdrant.ProductQuantization{
			Compression: qdrant.CompressionRatio_x16,
			Memory:      qdrant.Memory_Pinned.Enum(),
		},
	),
})
```

There are two parameters that you can specify in the `quantization_config` section:

`compression` - compression ratio.
Compression ratio represents the size of the quantized vector in bytes divided by the size of the original vector in bytes.
In this case, the quantized vector will be 16 times smaller than the original vector.

`memory` - the [memory tier](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/ops-configuration/memory-tiers/) for the quantized vectors. By default, depends on the placement of the original vectors. See [Default Tiers](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/ops-configuration/memory-tiers/#default-tiers).
However, in some setups you might want to keep quantized vectors in RAM to speed up the search process. Then set `memory` to `pinned`. If you're using a version older than 1.19, see [Legacy Settings](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/ops-configuration/memory-tiers/#legacy-settings).

### Disabling Quantization

To disable quantization in an existing collection, you can do the following:

**Http**

```http
PATCH /collections/{collection_name}
{
    "quantization_config": "Disabled"
}
```

**Bash**

```bash
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:6333/collections/{collection_name} \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
    "quantization_config": "Disabled"
  }'
```

**Python**

```python
client.update_collection(
    collection_name="{collection_name}",
    quantization_config=models.Disabled.DISABLED,
)
```

**Typescript**

```typescript
client.updateCollection("{collection_name}", {
    quantization_config: 'Disabled'
});
```

**Rust**

```rust
use qdrant_client::qdrant::{Disabled, UpdateCollectionBuilder};

client
    .update_collection(UpdateCollectionBuilder::new("{collection_name}").quantization_config(Disabled {}))
    .await?;
```

**Java**

```java
import io.qdrant.client.grpc.Collections.Disabled;
import io.qdrant.client.grpc.Collections.QuantizationConfigDiff;
import io.qdrant.client.grpc.Collections.UpdateCollection;

client.updateCollectionAsync(
    UpdateCollection.newBuilder()
        .setCollectionName("{collection_name}")
        .setQuantizationConfig(
            QuantizationConfigDiff.newBuilder()
                .setDisabled(Disabled.getDefaultInstance())
                .build())
        .build());
```

**Csharp**

```csharp
using Qdrant.Client;
using Qdrant.Client.Grpc;

var client = new QdrantClient("localhost", 6334);

await client.UpdateCollectionAsync(
	collectionName: "{collection_name}",
	quantizationConfig: new QuantizationConfigDiff { Disabled = new Disabled() }
);
```

**Go**

```go
import (
	"context"

	"github.com/qdrant/go-client/qdrant"
)

client, err := qdrant.NewClient(&qdrant.Config{
	Host: "localhost",
	Port: 6334,
})

client.UpdateCollection(context.Background(), &qdrant.UpdateCollection{
	CollectionName:     "{collection_name}",
	QuantizationConfig: qdrant.NewQuantizationDiffDisabled(),
})
```

### Searching with Quantization

Once you have configured quantization for a collection, you don't need to do anything extra to search with quantization.
Qdrant will automatically use quantized vectors if they are available.

However, there are a few options that you can use to control the search process:

**Http**

```http
POST /collections/{collection_name}/points/query
{
    "query": [0.2, 0.1, 0.9, 0.7],
    "params": {
        "quantization": {
            "ignore": false,
            "rescore": true,
            "oversampling": 2.0
        }
    },
    "limit": 10
}
```

**Python**

```python
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient, models

client = QdrantClient(url="http://localhost:6333")

client.query_points(
    collection_name="{collection_name}",
    query=[0.2, 0.1, 0.9, 0.7],
    search_params=models.SearchParams(
        quantization=models.QuantizationSearchParams(
            ignore=False,
            rescore=True,
            oversampling=2.0,
        )
    ),
)
```

**Typescript**

```typescript
import { QdrantClient } from "@qdrant/js-client-rest";

const client = new QdrantClient({ host: "localhost", port: 6333 });

client.query("{collection_name}", {
    query: [0.2, 0.1, 0.9, 0.7],
    params: {
        quantization: {
            ignore: false,
            rescore: true,
            oversampling: 2.0,
        },
    },
    limit: 10,
});
```

**Rust**

```rust
use qdrant_client::qdrant::{
    QuantizationSearchParamsBuilder, QueryPointsBuilder, SearchParamsBuilder,
};
use qdrant_client::Qdrant;

let client = Qdrant::from_url("http://localhost:6334").build()?;

client
    .query(
        QueryPointsBuilder::new("{collection_name}")
            .query(vec![0.2, 0.1, 0.9, 0.7])
            .limit(10)
            .params(
                SearchParamsBuilder::default().quantization(
                    QuantizationSearchParamsBuilder::default()
                        .ignore(false)
                        .rescore(true)
                        .oversampling(2.0),
                ),
            ),
    )
    .await?;
```

**Java**

```java
import static io.qdrant.client.QueryFactory.nearest;

QdrantClient client =
    new QdrantClient(QdrantGrpcClient.newBuilder("localhost", 6334, false).build());

client.queryAsync(
        QueryPoints.newBuilder()
                .setCollectionName("{collection_name}")
                .setQuery(nearest(0.2f, 0.1f, 0.9f, 0.7f))
                .setParams(
                        SearchParams.newBuilder()
                                .setQuantization(
                                        QuantizationSearchParams.newBuilder()
                                                .setIgnore(false)
                                                .setRescore(true)
                                                .setOversampling(2.0)
                                                .build())
                                .build())
                .setLimit(10)
                .build())
        .get();
```

**Csharp**

```csharp
using Qdrant.Client;
using Qdrant.Client.Grpc;

var client = new QdrantClient("localhost", 6334);

await client.QueryAsync(
	collectionName: "{collection_name}",
	query: new float[] { 0.2f, 0.1f, 0.9f, 0.7f },
	searchParams: new SearchParams
	{
		Quantization = new QuantizationSearchParams
		{
			Ignore = false,
			Rescore = true,
			Oversampling = 2.0
		}
	},
	limit: 10
);
```

**Go**

```go
import (
	"context"

	"github.com/qdrant/go-client/qdrant"
)

client, err := qdrant.NewClient(&qdrant.Config{
	Host: "localhost",
	Port: 6334,
})

client.Query(context.Background(), &qdrant.QueryPoints{
	CollectionName: "{collection_name}",
	Query:          qdrant.NewQuery(0.2, 0.1, 0.9, 0.7),
	Params: &qdrant.SearchParams{
		Quantization: &qdrant.QuantizationSearchParams{
			Ignore:       qdrant.PtrOf(false),
			Rescore:      qdrant.PtrOf(true),
			Oversampling: qdrant.PtrOf(2.0),
		},
	},
})
```

`ignore` - Toggle whether to ignore quantized vectors during the search process. By default, Qdrant will use quantized vectors if they are available.

`rescore` - Qdrant can re-evaluate top-k search results using the original vectors. While this can improve search quality, it may decrease search speed, especially if the original vectors are stored on disk. In such cases, it is recommended to disable rescoring. By default, rescoring is only enabled for four quantization methods: binary quantization, TurboQuant 1 Bit, TurboQuant 1.5 Bit, and TurboQuant 2 Bit. Other quantization methods do not rescore by default.

**Available as of v1.3.0**

`oversampling` - Defines how many extra vectors should be pre-selected using quantized index, and then re-scored using original vectors.
For example, if oversampling is 2.4 and limit is 100, then 240 vectors will be pre-selected using quantized index, and then top-100 will be returned after re-scoring.
Oversampling is useful if you want to tune the tradeoff between search speed and search quality in the query time.

## Quantization Tips

### Accuracy Tuning

In this section, we will discuss how to tune the search precision.
The fastest way to understand the impact of quantization on the search quality is to compare the search results with and without quantization.

In order to disable quantization, you can set `ignore` to `true` in the search request:

**Http**

```http
POST /collections/{collection_name}/points/query
{
    "query": [0.2, 0.1, 0.9, 0.7],
    "params": {
        "quantization": {
            "ignore": true
        }
    },
    "limit": 10
}
```

**Python**

```python
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient, models

client = QdrantClient(url="http://localhost:6333")

client.query_points(
    collection_name="{collection_name}",
    query=[0.2, 0.1, 0.9, 0.7],
    search_params=models.SearchParams(
        quantization=models.QuantizationSearchParams(
            ignore=True,
        )
    ),
)
```

**Typescript**

```typescript
import { QdrantClient } from "@qdrant/js-client-rest";

const client = new QdrantClient({ host: "localhost", port: 6333 });

client.query("{collection_name}", {
    query: [0.2, 0.1, 0.9, 0.7],
    params: {
        quantization: {
            ignore: true,
        },
    },
});
```

**Rust**

```rust
use qdrant_client::qdrant::{
    QuantizationSearchParamsBuilder, QueryPointsBuilder, SearchParamsBuilder,
};
use qdrant_client::Qdrant;

let client = Qdrant::from_url("http://localhost:6334").build()?;

client
    .query(
        QueryPointsBuilder::new("{collection_name}")
            .query(vec![0.2, 0.1, 0.9, 0.7])
            .limit(3)
            .params(
                SearchParamsBuilder::default()
                    .quantization(QuantizationSearchParamsBuilder::default().ignore(true)),
            ),
    )
    .await?;

client.Query(context.Background(), &qdrant.QueryPoints{
	CollectionName: "{collection_name}",
	Query:          qdrant.NewQuery(0.2, 0.1, 0.9, 0.7),
	Params: &qdrant.SearchParams{
		Quantization: &qdrant.QuantizationSearchParams{
			Ignore: qdrant.PtrOf(true),
		},
	},
})
```

- **Adjust the quantile parameter**: The quantile parameter in scalar quantization determines the quantization bounds.
  By setting it to a value lower than 1.0, you can exclude extreme values (outliers) from the quantization bounds.
  For example, if you set the quantile to 0.99, 1% of the extreme values will be excluded.
  By adjusting the quantile, you find an optimal value that will provide the best search quality for your collection.

- **Enable rescoring**: Qdrant can re-evaluate top-k search results using the original vectors. While this can improve search quality, it may decrease search speed, especially if the original vectors are stored on disk. In such cases, it is recommended to disable rescoring. By default, rescoring is only enabled for four quantization methods: binary quantization, TurboQuant 1 Bit, TurboQuant 1.5 Bit, and TurboQuant 2 Bit. Other quantization methods do not rescore by default.

### Memory and Speed Tuning

> **Note**
>
> This section covers the <code>memory</code> parameter introduced in Qdrant v1.19. If you're using an older version, see the <a href="https://qdrant.tech/documentation/ops-configuration/memory-tiers/#legacy-settings">Legacy Settings</a> section for how to map the new parameter to the old ones.

The memory usage and speed of the search process can be tuned by choosing a [memory tier](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/ops-configuration/memory-tiers/) for the original and quantized vectors. There are three possible memory tier configurations:

- **Original cached, quantized in RAM** - the original vectors are cached and the quantized vectors are pinned in RAM. This is the fastest mode, but requires enough RAM to hold both. This is the default.

- **Original cold, quantized pinned** - a hybrid mode that provides a good balance between speed and memory usage. It is recommended if you are aiming to shrink the memory footprint while keeping the search speed.

  This mode is enabled by setting the original vectors' `memory` to `cold` and the quantized vectors' `memory` to `pinned`:\
  **Http**

```http
PUT /collections/{collection_name}
{
    "vectors": {
        "size": 768,
        "distance": "Cosine",
        "memory": "cold",
        "datatype": "turbo4"
    },
    "quantization_config": {
        "turbo": {
            "bits": "bits1",
            "memory": "pinned"
        }
    }
}
```

**Python**

client.create_collection(
    collection_name="{collection_name}",
    vectors_config=models.VectorParams(
        size=768,
        distance=models.Distance.COSINE,
        memory=models.Memory.COLD,
        datatype=models.Datatype.TURBO4,
    ),
    quantization_config=models.TurboQuantization(
        turbo=models.TurboQuantQuantizationConfig(
            bits=models.TurboQuantBitSize.BITS1,
            memory=models.Memory.PINNED,
        ),

	    Size = 768, Distance = Distance.Cosine, Memory = Memory.Cold, Datatype = Datatype.Turbo4
	},
	quantizationConfig: new QuantizationConfig
	{
		Turboquant = new TurboQuantization { Memory = Memory.Pinned, Bits = TurboQuantBitSize.Bits1 }
	}
);
```

**Go**

```go
import (
	"context"

	"github.com/qdrant/go-client/qdrant"
)

client.CreateCollection(context.Background(), &qdrant.CreateCollection{
	CollectionName: "{collection_name}",
	VectorsConfig: qdrant.NewVectorsConfig(&qdrant.VectorParams{
		Size:     768,
		Distance: qdrant.Distance_Cosine,
		Memory:   qdrant.Memory_Cold.Enum(),
		Datatype: qdrant.Datatype_Turbo4.Enum(),
	}),
	QuantizationConfig: qdrant.NewQuantizationTurbo(
		&qdrant.TurboQuantization{
			Memory: qdrant.Memory_Pinned.Enum(),
			Bits:   qdrant.TurboQuantBitSize_Bits1.Enum(),
		},
	),
})
```

**Note**: These examples also set the [`turbo4`](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/manage-data/vectors/#turbo4) datatype on the original vectors, which stores each dimension as a 4-bit value instead of a full 32-bit float. This shrinks the on-disk footprint further, but it can reduce recall and search quality. Weigh these trade-offs before you use `turbo4` in your setup. The memory tier itself is set by the `memory` parameters alone, so you can use this mode without `turbo4`.

In this scenario, the number of disk reads may play a significant role in the search speed.
In a system with high disk latency, the re-scoring step may become a bottleneck.

Consider disabling `rescore` to improve the search speed:\
**Http**

```http
POST /collections/{collection_name}/points/query
{
    "query": [0.2, 0.1, 0.9, 0.7],

- **All cold** - both the original and quantized vectors are stored on disk. This mode achieves the smallest memory footprint, but at the cost of search speed.

  It is recommended to use this mode if you have a large collection and fast storage (e.g. SSD or NVMe).

  This mode is enabled by setting both the original and quantized vectors' `memory` to `cold`:\
  **Http**

```http
PUT /collections/{collection_name}
{
    "vectors": {
      "size": 768,
      "distance": "Cosine",
      "memory": "cold"
    },
    "quantization_config": {
        "scalar": {
            "type": "int8",
            "memory": "cold"
