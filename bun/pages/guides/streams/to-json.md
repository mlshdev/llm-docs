# Convert a ReadableStream to JSON

Bun provides several conveniences for reading the contents of a [`ReadableStream`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream) into other formats. To read a stream and parse it as JSON, call its `json()` method.

```ts
const stream = new ReadableStream();
const json = await stream.json();
```
