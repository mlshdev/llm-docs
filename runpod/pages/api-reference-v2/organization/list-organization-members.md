# List Organization Members

List the members of your organization and the role each one holds.

`GET /v2/organization/users`

**List organization members**

Returns every member of the authenticated caller's organization with the role each holds. Any member can read the roster. The list is complete and takes no pagination parameters. Returns 404 when the caller does not belong to an organization, or 403 when organizations are unavailable to the caller.

**Authentication:** `bearerAuth`

**Responses**

- `200`: OK
  - Header `RateLimit` (string): Live quota state for the caller, per the IETF ratelimit-headers draft.
  - Header `RateLimit-Policy` (string): The quota policy behind `RateLimit`, per the IETF ratelimit-headers draft.
  - Media type: `application/json`
    - Schema (object)
      - `users` (required; array): Every member of the organization.
        - `items` (object): A member of the caller's organization. `id` is the member's user ID.
          - `id` (required; string): User ID.
          - `email` (required; nullable): The member's email address. Null for an account that has none.
          - `role` (required; object): An organization role, by ID and display name.
            - `id` (required; string): Role ID. A built-in role's ID is `builtin:` followed by its key; a custom role carries its own ID.
            - `type` (required; string; enum: `builtin`, `custom`): Who defines the role. `builtin` roles are Runpod's: `builtin:admin`, `builtin:dev`, `builtin:billing` and `builtin:basic`. A `custom` role is one the organization defined, under its own ID.
            - `name` (required; string): The role's display name: `Admin`, `Developer`, `Billing` or `Contributor` for a built-in role, or a custom role's own name. A custom role that has since been deleted reads as `Contributor` while `id` keeps its own ID.
          - `groups` (required; array): The groups the member belongs to, by name.
            - `items` (object): An organization group, by ID and name.
              - `id` (required; string): Group ID.
              - `name` (required; string): Group name.
    - Example `users`: `{"users":[{"id":"user_id_abc_123","email":"owner@example.com","role":{"id":"builtin:admin","type":"builtin","name":"Admin"},"groups":[]},{"id":"user_id_def_456","email":"member@example.com","role":{"id":"builtin:dev","type":"builtin","name":"Developer"},"groups":[{"id":"group_id_abc_123","name":"Engineering"}]}]}`
- `401`: Authentication failed because the bearer token is missing, malformed, expired, or invalid.
  - Media type: `application/problem+json`
    - Schema (object)
      - `title` (required; string): Short human-readable summary
      - `status` (required; integer): HTTP status code
      - `detail` (required; string): Human-readable explanation
      - `errors` (array): Individual request-validation failures.
        - `items` (string)
    - Example `missingBearerToken`: `{"title":"Unauthorized","status":401,"detail":"missing bearer token"}`
- `403`: The bearer token is valid, but it does not grant access to the requested resource or action.
  - Header `RateLimit` (string): Live quota state for the caller, per the IETF ratelimit-headers draft.
  - Header `RateLimit-Policy` (string): The quota policy behind `RateLimit`, per the IETF ratelimit-headers draft.
  - Media type: `application/problem+json`
    - Schema (object)
      - `title` (required; string): Short human-readable summary
      - `status` (required; integer): HTTP status code

        - `items` (string)
    - Example `notFound`: `{"title":"Not Found","status":404,"detail":"resource not found"}`
- `429`: The caller exceeded its per-user rate limit. The response identifies the window that was exceeded and how long to wait. The `RateLimit` and `RateLimit-Policy` headers (per the IETF ratelimit-headers draft) also accompany successful responses, so clients can track quota before a 429.
  - Header `Retry-After` (integer): Seconds to wait before retrying, per the exceeded window.
