# Get A Template

Retrieve the complete configuration of an owned or public Runpod template by ID, including settings used to create Pods and endpoints.

`GET /v2/templates/{id}`

**Get a template**

Returns the full configuration of a single template by ID. Serves
both templates you own and public catalog templates — everything you
can read. Updates and deletes remain restricted to templates you own.

**Authentication:** `bearerAuth`

**Parameters**

- `id` (path; required; string)
  - Example: `tpl_abc`

**Responses**

- `200`: OK
  - Header `RateLimit` (string)
  - Header `RateLimit-Policy` (string)
  - Media type: `application/json`
    - Schema
      - allOf:
        - `variant 1`: Reusable container configuration shared across templates, pods, and serverless endpoints. Adding a field here automatically propagates to all three resources.
          - allOf:
            - `variant 1` (object): Container configuration universal to every containerized resource. Compose ContainerConfig instead unless the resource cannot support a direct registry credential (clusters — there the registry credential arrives via a pod template, see CreateClusterRequest.templateId).
              - `args` (string): The container's command, as a single raw string. This is the field `entrypoint` and `cmd` encode into, exposed in its stored form. Two shapes are accepted. A bare shell string is treated as CMD and split into arguments, which is what the console's "Container start command" field writes. A JSON object of the form `{"entrypoint":[...],"cmd":[...]}` sets either or both explicitly. Responses always return both representations: `args` exactly as stored, plus the deconstructed `entrypoint` and `cmd`. Supplying `args` together with `entrypoint` or `cmd` is allowed only when they describe the same command, so a read-modify-write client can send back everything it received. Send `""` to clear, omit to leave unchanged.
              - `cmd` (array): Container CMD in exec form. When the image defines an ENTRYPOINT, this is the argument list passed to it. Encoded into the `args` field; supplying both is allowed only when they describe the same command. Send `[]` to clear, omit to leave unchanged.
                - `items` (string)
              - `entrypoint` (array): Container ENTRYPOINT in exec form, overriding the image's own. Encoded into `args` field; supplying both is allowed only when they describe the same command. Send `[]` to clear, omit to leave unchanged.
                - `items` (string)
              - `disk` (integer; minimum: `1`): Container disk in GB (ephemeral, wiped on restart)
              - `env` (object): Environment variables as key-value pairs
                - `additional properties` (string)
              - `image` (string): Docker image reference
              - `ports` (array): Exposed ports, formatted as port/protocol
                - `items` (string)
            - `variant 2` (object)
              - `registry` (nullable): Container registry credential ID (for private images)
        - `variant 2` (object)
          - `id` (required; string)
          - `name` (required; string)
          - `mounts` (required; object): Storage mounts attached to a template. Templates support only a single persistent mount today; any `network` property is rejected with 422 by the schema validator. PATCH semantics: omitting `mounts` or sending `{}` leaves the existing mount unchanged.
            - `persistent` (object): Host-local persistent storage. Pinned to the pod's host machine — data does not survive a host failure. Disallowed on CPU pods. Mutually exclusive with NetworkMount. Deprecated: prefer NetworkMount for any data you cannot recreate.
              - `size` (required; integer; minimum: `10`): Host-local persistent storage in GB. Upstream enforces a 10 GB floor.
              - `path` (required; string): Mount path inside the container. May be changed via PATCH.
          - `serverless` (required; boolean): Whether this template is for serverless workers (true) or pods (false)
          - `public` (required; boolean): Whether this template is visible to other Runpod users
          - `category` (required; string; enum: `CPU`, `NVIDIA`, `AMD`): Controls how the template is grouped and filtered in the Runpod console. It does not affect hardware selection, scheduling, or billing. - `CPU` — CPU-only workloads - `NVIDIA` — NVIDIA GPU workloads - `AMD` — AMD GPU workloads
          - `startSsh` (required; boolean): Whether containers created from this template get SSH access provisioned at startup (`PUBLIC_KEY` env injection).
          - `startJupyter` (required; boolean): Whether containers created from this template start JupyterLab at startup (`JUPYTER_PASSWORD` env injection).
          - `allowedCudaVersions` (required; array): Acceptable CUDA versions for containers created from this template, as `major.minor`. Empty means any version. Expanded into GPU pod and serverless endpoint creates; CPU pods ignore it.
            - `items` (string)
    - Example `template`: `{"id":"9x4m2p7v","name":"PyTorch GPU Template","image":"runpod/pytorch:1.0.2-cu1281-torch280-ubuntu2404","args":"","disk":50,"mounts":{"persistent":{"size":20,"path":"/workspace"}},"ports":["8888/http"],"env":{"JUPYTER_ENABLE_LAB":"yes"},"registry":null,"serverless":false,"public":false,"category":"NVIDIA","startSsh":true,"startJupyter":false,"allowedCudaVersions":[]}`
