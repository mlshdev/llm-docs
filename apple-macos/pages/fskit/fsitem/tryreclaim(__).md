# tryReclaim(\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** FSKit  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** macOS 27.0+

Reclaims the item by executing the given block, if conditions allow.

## Declaration

```swift
func tryReclaim(_ reclaimBlock: @escaping () -> Void) -> Bool
```

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

`true` (Swift) or YES (Obj-C)  if the reclaim block ran; otherwise, `false` (Swift) or `NO` (Obj-C). When your [reclaimItem(\_:replyHandler:)](../fsvolume/handler/reclaimitem%28__replyhandler_%29.md) implementation receives a `false`/`NO` return value, call `replyHandler(nil)`.

## Discussion

Invoke this method in your implementation of the [reclaimItem(\_:replyHandler:)](../fsvolume/handler/reclaimitem%28__replyhandler_%29.md) operation.

FSKit internally maintains a count of how many times it returns each [FSItem](../fsitem.md) to the kernel, via either a creation operation or a lookup. The kernel file system also maintains a count of how many times a create or a lookup operation returned a vnode. When the kernel reclaims the vnode associated with an FSItem, the FSItem is only eligible for reclaiming when both the kernel and user space counts agree. This mechanism addresses a potential race condition in which concurrent reclaim and lookup operations might lead to a lookup returning a deallocated [FSItem](../fsitem.md), and as a result, induce undefined behavior. File systems that don’t invoke this method during reclaim are exposed to this race condition.

> **Important**

> The caller must invoke this method within a synchronization context that ensures the [FSItem](../fsitem.md) isn’t concurrently returned by lookup operations.

Example Usage:

**Swift**

```swift
func reclaimItem(_ item: FSItem,
                 replyHandler reply: @escaping @Sendable ((any Error)?) -> Void) {
    var reclaimError: NSError? = nil // To be set during the reclaim block in case of an error.

    // *** CRITICAL SECTION BEGINS HERE ***
    // (A synchronization context that ensures the FSItem isn't concurrently returned by lookup operations)

    // Calling `tryReclaim(_:)` with the cleanup logic within the passed block
    let wasReclaimed = item.tryReclaim( {
        // Closure includes all required cleanup operations for reclaiming this item.
        // Sets `reclaimError` in case of an error during the cleanup phase.
    } )

    // *** CRITICAL SECTION ENDS HERE ***

    if (wasReclaimed) {
        // Clean up the FSItem if special teardown is needed.
        reply(reclaimError)
    } else {
        // Do nothing; the FSItem wasn't reclaimed, so it's not yet time to run cleanup.
        reply(nil)
    }
}
```

**Objective-C**

```objc
- (void)reclaimItem:(FSItem *)item
    replyHandler:(void(^)(NSError * _Nullable error))reply
{
    __block NSError *reclaimError = nil; // To be set during the reclaim block in case of an error.

    // *** CRITICAL SECTION BEGINS HERE ***
    // (A synchronization context that ensures the FSItem isn't concurrently returned by lookup operations)

    // Calling `tryReclaimWithBlock:` with the cleanup logic within the passed block
    BOOL wasReclaimed = [item tryReclaimWithBlock:^{
        // Includes all required cleanup operations for reclaiming this item.
        // Sets `reclaimError` in case of an error during the cleanup phase
    }];

    // *** CRITICAL SECTION ENDS HERE ***

    if (wasReclaimed) {
        // Clean up the FSItem if special teardown is needed.
        reply(reclaimError);
    } else {
        // Do nothing; the FSItem wasn't reclaimed, so it's not yet time to run cleanup.
        reply(nil);
    }
}
```

# tryReclaimWithBlock: (Objective-C)

**Framework:** FSKit  
**Kind:** Instance Method

Reclaims the item by executing the given block, if conditions allow.

## Return Value

`true` (Swift) or YES (Obj-C)  if the reclaim block ran; otherwise, `false` (Swift) or `NO` (Obj-C). When your [reclaimItem:replyHandler:](../fsvolume/handler/reclaimitem%28__replyhandler_%29.md) implementation receives a `false`/`NO` return value, call `replyHandler(nil)`.
