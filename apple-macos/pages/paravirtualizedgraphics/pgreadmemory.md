# PGReadMemory

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** Paravirtualized Graphics  
**Kind:** Type Alias  
**Availability:** Mac Catalyst 14.0+

The block signature for a routine that copies data from guest physical memory into host memory.

## Declaration

```objectivec
typedef _Bool (^)(unsigned long long, unsigned long long, void *) PGReadMemory;
```

## Parameters

- `physicalAddress`: The physical guest address of the data to read.
- `length`: The number of bytes to read.
- `dst`: The destination for the copied data.
