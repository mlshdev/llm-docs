# Event Types (Swift)

**Framework:** Endpoint Security  
**Kind:** API Collection

Types used by messages to deliver details specific to different kinds of Endpoint Security events.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

The types in this section contain details of each event that an Endpoint Security message can contain. While the [es_message_t](es_message_t.md) type itself is generic, the members of its [event](es_message_t/event.md) union contain specific event types.

For example, when the message’s [event_type](es_message_t/event_type.md) is [ES_EVENT_TYPE_NOTIFY_FORK](es_event_type_notify_fork.md), you access the event’s [fork](es_events_t/fork.md) member, whose type is [es_event_fork_t](es_event_fork_t.md). This type has properties specific to process-forking events, such as the [child](es_event_fork_t/child.md) process that resulted from the fork operation.
