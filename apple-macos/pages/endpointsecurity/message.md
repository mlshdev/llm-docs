# Message (Swift)

**Framework:** Endpoint Security  
**Kind:** API Collection

A type used by Endpoint Security to notify your client when a monitored action occurs.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

When Endpoint Security monitors an event of a given type, it sends a message to all clients subscribed to that event type, containing data about the event. Handlers use this information to react to the event. In the case of authorization events, handlers must actively respond to the message and authorize or deny the monitored action. The client must respond before the [deadline](es_message_t/deadline.md) specified by the message.

The following code shows a handler that reacts to events of the type [ES_EVENT_TYPE_AUTH_RENAME](es_event_type_auth_rename.md). Because the handler knows the event type, it can access the [rename](es_events_t/rename.md) member of the message’s [event](es_message_t/event.md) union. From this, it gets the [source](es_event_rename_t/source.md) of the rename event, and inspects the source file path. The handler denies authorization to the event if the filename includes the string `DONOTMOVE`, and allows it otherwise.

```c
es_handler_block_t handler = ^void  (es_client_t* _Nonnull client, const es_message_t* _Nonnull message) {
    switch (message->event_type) {
        case ES_EVENT_TYPE_AUTH_RENAME: {
            es_auth_result_t myResult = strstr(message->event.rename.source->path.data, "DONOTMOVE")
                ? ES_AUTH_RESULT_DENY : ES_AUTH_RESULT_ALLOW;
            es_respond_auth_result(client, message, myResult, false);
            break;
        }
        // Handle any other cases you have subscribed to with
        // additional case: statements.
        default:
            break;
    }
};

```
