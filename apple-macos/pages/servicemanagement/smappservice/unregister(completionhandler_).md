# unregister(completionHandler:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Service Management  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** Mac Catalyst 16.0+ · macOS 13.0+

Unregisters the service so the system no longer launches it and calls a completion handler you provide with the resulting error value.

## Declaration

```swift
func unregister(completionHandler handler: @escaping @Sendable ((any Error)?) -> Void)
```

```swift
func unregister() async throws
```

## Parameters

- `handler`: A completion handler to call with the result of the unregistration operation. Upon an unsuccessful return, the handler contains a new [NSError](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nserror) object describing the error. Upon successful return, this argument is `NULL`.
