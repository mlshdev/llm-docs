## Discussion

This enumeration defines constants for color spaces which can specify color values for a bitmap image. As a rule, these constants include a packing format, defined in [Color Packing for Color Spaces](1560270-color_packing_for_color_spaces.md). You can use these constants to set the `space` field of the `CMBitmap` type definition identifies the color space in which the colors of the bitmap image are specified, as described in [Abstract Color Space Constants](1560701-abstract_color_space_constants.md).

### Version-Notes

The constants `cmRGBASpace` and `cmGrayASpace` were moved to [Abstract Color Space Constants](1560701-abstract_color_space_constants.md) in ColorSync version 2.5.

The constants `cmGray16Space`, `cmGrayA32Space`, `cmRGB48Space`, `cmCMYK64Space`, and `cmLAB48Space` were added in ColorSync version 2.5.
