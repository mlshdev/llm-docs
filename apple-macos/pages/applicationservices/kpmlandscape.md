## Discussion

Specifies landscape (horizontal) orientation. Landscape orientation performs a 90° counterclockwise rotation on the logical page image and sets the Quartz origin to the upper-left corner of the unrotated logical page with positive y-values increasing across and to the right of the unrotated page. This has the effect of rotating the logical page image 90° clockwise. In other words, the image appears on the unrotated page as if it were rotated 90° clockwise.
