## Overview

You can call the function [NCWNewColorWorld](colorsync_manager/1805079-ncwnewcolorworld.md) to create a color world for operations such as color matching and color conversion. A color world is normally based on two profiles—source and destination. But it can include a series of profiles that describe the processing for a work-flow sequence, such as scanning, printing, and previewing an image. To create a color world that includes a series of profiles, you use the function [CWConcatColorWorld](colorsync_manager/1805087-cwconcatcolorworld.md).

The array specified in the `profileSet` field identifies a concatenated profile set your application can use to establish a color world in which the sequential relationship among the profiles exists until your application disposes of the color world. Alternatively, you can create a device link profile composed of a series of linked profiles that remains intact and available for use again after your application disposes of the concatenated color world. In either case, you use a data structure of type `CMConcatProfileSet` to define the profile set. 

A device link profile accommodates users who use a specific configuration requiring a combination of device profiles and possibly non-device profiles repeatedly over time.

To set up a color world that includes a concatenated set of profiles, your application uses the function [CWConcatColorWorld](colorsync_manager/1805087-cwconcatcolorworld.md) , passing it a structure of type `CMConcatProfileSet.` The array you pass may contain a set of profile references or it may contain only the profile reference of a device link profile. To create a device link profile, your application calls the function [CWNewLinkProfile](colorsync_manager/1804915-cwnewlinkprofile.md), passing a structure of type `CMConcatProfileSet`.

## Topics

### Instance Properties

- [count](cmconcatprofileset/1560649-count.md): Deprecated. The one-based count of profiles in the profile array. A minimum of one profile is required.
- [keyIndex](cmconcatprofileset/1560608-keyindex.md): Deprecated. A zero-based index into the array of profile references identifying the profile whose CMM is used for the entire session. The profile’s `CMMType` field identifies the CMM.
- [profileSet](cmconcatprofileset/1560151-profileset.md): Deprecated. A variable-length array of profile references. The references must be in processing order from source to destination. The rules governing the types of profiles you can specify in a profile array differ depending on whether you are creating a profile set for the function [CWConcatColorWorld](colorsync_manager/1805087-cwconcatcolorworld.md) or for the function [CWNewLinkProfile](colorsync_manager/1804915-cwnewlinkprofile.md). See the function descriptions for details.
