## Discussion

A gamut result color space for the resulting bitmap pointed to by the `resultBitMap` field of the function [CWMatchColors](colorsync_manager/1805108-cwmatchcolors.md), with 1-bit direct packing. A pixel in the returned bitmap with value 1 (displayed as black) indicates an out-of-gamut color, while a pixel value of 0 (white) indicates a color that is in gamut.
