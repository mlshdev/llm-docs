## Discussion

Set the callback function to be called whenthe Speech Synthesis Manager encounters a synchronization commandwithin an embedded speech command in text being processed on thespeech channel. The `speechInfo` parameteris a pointer to an application-defined synchronization callback function,whose syntax is described in [SpeechSyncProcPtr](speechsyncprocptr.md).Passing `NULL` in `speechInfo` disablesthe synchronization callback function.

This selector works with the `SetSpeechInfo` function.
