# CMProfileIdentifierFolderSearch

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** Application Services

Searches the ColorSync Profiles folder and returns a list of profile references, one for each profile that matches the specified profile identifier.

## Declaration

```objectivec
CMError CMProfileIdentifierFolderSearch (
   CMProfileIdentifierPtr ident,
   UInt32 *matchedCount,
   CMProfileSearchRef *searchResult
);
```

## Parameters

- `ident`: A pointer to a profile identifier structure specifying the profile to search for.
- `matchedCount`: A pointer to a value of type `unsigned long`. On return, the one-based count of profiles that match the specified profile identifier. The count is typically 0 or 1, but can be higher.
- `searchResult`: A pointer to a search result reference of type `CMProfileSearchRef`. On return, a reference to the profile search result list. Only version 2.x profiles are included in the profile search result.

## Return Value

A `CMError` value. See [Result Codes](../colorsync_manager.md#1670295). It is not an error condition if this function finds no matching profiles. It returns an error only if a File Manager or other low-level system error occurs.

## Overview

When your application or device driver processes an image, it can keep a list of profile references for each profile it encounters in the image. Each time it encounters an embedded profile identifier, your application can call the function [CMProfileIdentifierListSearch](1805376-cmprofileidentifierlistsearch.md) to see if there is already a matching profile reference in its list. If not, it can call the `CMProfileIdentifierFolderSearch` function to see if the profile is located in the ColorSync Profiles folder.

Although there should typically be at most one profile in the ColorSync Profiles folder that matches the profile identifier, two or more profiles with different filenames may qualify.
