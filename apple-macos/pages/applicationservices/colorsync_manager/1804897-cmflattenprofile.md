# CMFlattenProfile

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** Application Services

Transfers a profile stored in an independent disk file to an external profile format that can be embedded in a graphics document.

## Declaration

```objectivec
CMError CMFlattenProfile (
   CMProfileRef prof,
   UInt32 flags,
   CMFlattenUPP proc,
   void *refCon,
   Boolean *preferredCMMnotfound
);
```

## Parameters

- `prof`: A profile reference of type [CMProfileRef](../cmprofileref.md) to the profile to flatten.
- `flags`: Reserved for future use.
- `proc`: A pointer to a function that you provide to perform the low-level data transfer. For more information, see the function [CMFlattenProcPtr](../cmflattenprocptr.md).
- `refCon`: A pointer to a reference constant for application data which the color management module (CMM) passes to the `CMFlattenProcPtr` function each time it calls the function. For example, the reference constant may point to a data structure that holds information required by the `CMFlattenProcPtr` function to perform the data transfer, such as the reference number to a disk file in which the flattened profile is to be stored.

  Starting with ColorSync version 2.5, the ColorSync Manager calls your transfer function directly, without going through the preferred, or any, CMM.
- `preferredCMMnotfound`: A pointer to a flag for whether the preferred CMM was found. On return, has the value `true` if the CMM specified by the profile was not available to perform flattening or does not support this function and the default CMM was used. Has the value `false` if the profile’s preferred CMM is able to perform flattening.

  Starting with ColorSync 2.5, the ColorSync Manager calls your transfer function directly, without going through the preferred, or any, CMM. On return, the value of `preferredCMMnotfound` is guaranteed to be `false`.

## Return Value

A `CMError` value. See [Result Codes](../colorsync_manager.md#1670295).

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

The ColorSync Manager passes to the CMM the pointer to your profile-flattening function. The CMM calls your function [CMFlattenProcPtr](../cmflattenprocptr.md) to perform the actual data transfer.

To unflatten a profile embedded in a graphics document to an independent disk file, use the function “Accessing Profile Elements”.

### Version-Notes

Prior to version 2.5, the ColorSync Manager dispatches the `CMFlattenProfile` function to the CMM specified by the profile whose reference you provide. If the preferred CMM is unavailable or it does not support this function, then the default CMM is used.

Starting with ColorSync version 2.5, the ColorSync Manager calls your transfer function directly, without going through the preferred, or any, CMM. As a result, the value returned in the `preferredCMMnotfound` parameter is guaranteed to be `false`.
