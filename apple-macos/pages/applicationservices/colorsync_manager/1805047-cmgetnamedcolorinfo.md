# CMGetNamedColorInfo

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** Application Services

Obtains information about a named color space from its profile reference.

## Declaration

```objectivec
CMError CMGetNamedColorInfo (
   CMProfileRef prof,
   UInt32 *deviceChannels,
   OSType *deviceColorSpace,
   OSType *PCSColorSpace,
   UInt32 *count,
   StringPtr prefix,
   StringPtr suffix
);
```

## Parameters

- `prof`: A profile reference of type [CMProfileRef](../cmprofileref.md) to a named color space profile to obtain named color information from.
- `deviceChannels`: A pointer to a count value. On return, the number of device channels in the color space for the profile. It should agree with the “data color space” field in the profile header. For example, Pantone maps to CMYK, a four-channel color space. A value of 0 indicates no device channels were available.
- `deviceColorSpace`: A pointer to a device color space. On return, a device color space, such as CMYK.
- `PCSColorSpace`: A pointer to a profile connection space color space. On return, an interchange color space, such as Lab.
- `count`: A pointer to a count value. On return, the number of named colors in the profile.
- `prefix`: A pointer to a Pascal string. On return, the string contains a prefix, such as “Pantone”, for each color name. The prefix identifies the named color system described by the profile.
- `suffix`: A pointer to a Pascal string. On return, the string contains a suffix for each color name, such as “CVC”.
