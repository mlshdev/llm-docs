# PMPrintSettingsCopyAsDictionary(\_:\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Application Services  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** macOS 10.5+

Creates a dictionary that contains the settings in a print settings object.

## Declaration

```swift
func PMPrintSettingsCopyAsDictionary(_ printSettings: PMPrintSettings, _ settingsDictionary: UnsafeMutablePointer<Unmanaged<CFDictionary>?>) -> OSStatus
```

## Parameters

- `printSettings`: The print settings object with the desired settings.
- `settingsDictionary`: A pointer to your [CFDictionary](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corefoundation/cfdictionary) variable. On return, the variable refers to a Core Foundation dictionary that contains the settings in the specified print settings object. Some of the keys in this dictionary are currently defined in `PMTicket.h`; other keys are user-defined. You are responsible for releasing the dictionary. If an error occurs, the variable is set to `NULL`.

## Discussion

Most developers have no need to use this function. However, one way this function might be useful would be to enumerate all the entries in a print settings object for inspection.
