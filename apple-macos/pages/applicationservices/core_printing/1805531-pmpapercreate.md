# PMPaperCreate

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** Application Services

Creates a paper object.

> Use [PMPrinterGetPaperList](../1460088-pmprintergetpaperlist.md) to find the built-in papers available for a given printer or use [PMPaperCreateCustom](../1459322-pmpapercreatecustom.md) to create a custom paper.

## Declaration

```objectivec
OSStatus PMPaperCreate (
   PMPrinter printer,
   CFStringRef id,
   CFStringRef name,
   double width,
   double height,
   const PMPaperMargins *margins,
   PMPaper *paperP
);
```

## Parameters

- `printer`: A printer object for which the paper is appropriate.
- `id`: A unique identifier for this paper.
- `name`: The name to display to the user for this paper.
- `width`: The width of the paper, in points.
- `height`: The height of the paper, in points.
- `margins`: A pointer to a [PMPaperMargins](../pmpapermargins.md) structure that specifies the unprintable margins of the paper, in points. The four values in the structure specify the top, left, bottom, and right imageable area margins of the paper.
- `paperP`: A pointer to your [PMPaper](../pmpaper.md) variable. On return, the variable refers to a new paper object with the specified attributes. You are responsible for releasing the paper object with the function [PMRelease](../1461402-pmrelease.md). The variable is set to `NULL` if the object could not be created.

### Special Considerations

This function creates a paper object but does not mark it as a custom paper, so it appears to the printing system as if it were a built-in paper. This can be produce unpredictable results, so this function is deprecated.
