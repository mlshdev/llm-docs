## Discussion

Set a speech channel’s reference constantvalue. The reference constant value is passed to application-definedcallback functions and might contain any value convenient for theapplication. The `speechInfo` parameteris a long integer containing the reference constant value. In contrastwith other selectors, this selector does not require that the `speechInfo` parameter’s valuebe a pointer value. Typically, however, an application does usethis selector to pass a pointer or handle value to callback functions.

This selector works with the `SetSpeechInfo` function.
