## Discussion

Set the current voice on the current speechchannel to the specified voice. The `speechInfo` parameteris a pointer to a voice specification structure. Your applicationshould create the structure by calling [MakeVoiceSpec(\_:\_:\_:)](1461446-makevoicespec.md). `SetSpeechInfo` willreturn an `incompatibleVoice` errorif the specified voice is incompatible with the speech synthesizerassociated with the speech channel. If you have a speech channelopen using a voice from a particular synthesizer and you try toswitch to a voice that works with a different synthesizer, you receivean `incompatibleVoice` error.You need to create a new channel to use with the new voice.

This selector works with the `SetSpeechInfo` function.
