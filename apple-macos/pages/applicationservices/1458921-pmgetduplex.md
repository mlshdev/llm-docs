# PMGetDuplex(\_:\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Application Services  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** macOS 10.4+

Obtains the selected duplex mode.

## Declaration

```swift
func PMGetDuplex(_ printSettings: PMPrintSettings, _ duplexSetting: UnsafeMutablePointer<PMDuplexMode>) -> OSStatus
```

## Parameters

- `printSettings`: The print settings object whose duplex mode you want to obtain.
- `duplexSetting`: A pointer to your `PMDuplexMode` variable. On return, the variable contains the duplex mode setting in the current print job. Possible values include:

  - `kPMDuplexNone` (one-sided printing)
  - `kPMDuplexNoTumble` (two-sided printing)
  - `kPMDuplexTumble` (two-sided printing with tumbling)

  See [PMDuplexMode](pmduplexmode.md) for a full description of the duplex mode constants.
