# PMPaperCreateCustom(\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Application Services  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** macOS 10.5+

Creates a custom paper object.

## Declaration

```swift
func PMPaperCreateCustom(_ printer: PMPrinter?, _ id: CFString?, _ name: CFString?, _ width: Double, _ height: Double, _ margins: UnsafePointer<PMPaperMargins>, _ paperP: UnsafeMutablePointer<PMPaper?>) -> OSStatus
```

## Parameters

- `printer`: A printer for which the specified paper size is appropriate.
- `id`: A unique identifier for this custom paper. For example, you could create a UUID string and use it as the unique identifier.
- `name`: The name to display to the user for this custom paper.
- `width`: The width of the paper, in points.
- `height`: The height of the paper, in points.
- `margins`: A pointer to a [PMPaperMargins](pmpapermargins.md) structure that specifies the unprintable margins of the paper, in points. The four values in the structure specify the top, left, bottom, and right imageable area margins of the paper.
- `paperP`: A pointer to your [PMPaper](pmpaper.md) variable. On return, the variable refers to a new custom paper object. You are responsible for releasing the paper object with the function [PMRelease(\_:)](1461402-pmrelease.md).

## Discussion

This function creates a custom paper object appropriate for the specified printer. Custom papers are treated differently than built-in papers by the printing system. To obtain one of the available built-in papers for a given printer, you can use the function [PMPrinterGetPaperList(\_:\_:)](1460088-pmprintergetpaperlist.md).
