## Discussion

Specifies reverse landscape page orientation. Landscape orientation performs a 90° clockwise rotation on the logical page rectangle and sets the Quartz origin to the lower-right corner of the unrotated logical page, with the positive y-values increasing to across and to the left of the unrotated page. This has the effect of rotating the logical page image 90° counterclockwise. In other words, the image appears on the unrotated page as if it were rotated 90° counterclockwise.
