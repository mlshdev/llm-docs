## Discussion

Disables prosody at end of sentences. The `kNoEndingProsody` flagbit is used to control whether or not the speech synthesizer automaticallyapplies ending prosody, the speech tone and cadence that normallyoccur at the end of a statement. Under normal circumstances (forexample, when the flag bit is not set), ending prosody is appliedto the speech when the end of the `textBuf` datais reached. This default behavior can be disabled by setting the `kNoEndingProsody` flagbit.

Some synthesizers do not speak until the `kNoEndingProsody` flagbit is reset, or they encounter a period in the text, or `textBuf` isfull.
