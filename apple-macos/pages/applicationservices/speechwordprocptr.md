# SpeechWordProcPtr (Swift)

**Framework:** Application Services  
**Kind:** Type Alias  
**Availability:** macOS 10.0+

Defines a pointer to a word callback functionthat is called by the Speech Synthesis Manager before it pronouncesa word.

## Declaration

```swift
typealias SpeechWordProcPtr = (SpeechChannel, SRefCon, UInt, UInt16) -> Void
```

## Parameters

- `chan`: The speech channel that has finished processing input text.
- `refCon`: The reference constant associated with the speech channel.
- `wordPos`: The number of bytes between the beginning of the text buffer and the beginning of the word about to be pronounced.
- `wordLen`: The length in bytes of the word about to be pronounced.

## Discussion

The Speech Synthesis Manager calls a speech channel’s wordcallback function just before it pronounces a word. You might usesuch a callback function, for example, to draw the word about tobe spoken in a window. In this case, the callback function wouldset a global flag variable to indicate that the word being spokenis changing and another two global variables to `wordPos` and `wordLen`.A function called by your application’s main event loop coulddetect that the word being spoken is changing and draw the wordin a window.

You can specify a word callback function by passing the `soWordCallBack` selectorto the `SetSpeechInfo` function.
