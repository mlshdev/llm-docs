# setCachedSeparately:

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** AppKit  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** macOS 10.0+ (deprecated in 10.6)

Sets whether each image representation uses a separate offscreen window to cache its contents.

> `NSImage` no longer caches to windows. There is no replacement method

## Declaration

```objectivec
- (void) setCachedSeparately:(BOOL) flag;
```

## Parameters

- `flag`: [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true) if you want each of the receiver’s image representation objects to use a separate offscreen window for caching; otherwise, [false](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false).

## Discussion

If you specify [false](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false), a representation can be cached together with other images, though in practice it might not be. This method does not invalidate any existing caches.

If you plan to resize an `NSImage` object frequently, it is usually more efficient to cache its representations separately. In some situations, you might also want to enable separate caching if you plan to use the [compositeToPoint:fromRect:operation:](compositetopoint_fromrect_operation_.md) or [compositeToPoint:fromRect:operation:fraction:](compositetopoint_fromrect_operation_fraction_.md)methods to draw the image.
