# matchesOnMultipleResolution (Swift)

**Framework:** AppKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** macOS

A Boolean value that indicates whether image representations whose resolution is an integral multiple of the device resolution are a match.

## Declaration

```swift
var matchesOnMultipleResolution: Bool { get set }
```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

When this property is set to [false](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false), only image representations whose resolution is exactly the same as the device resolution are matches. If the property is set to [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true) and multiple image representations fit this criteria, the one whose resolution is closest to the device resolution is chosen.

The default value is [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true).
