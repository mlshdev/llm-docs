## Discussion

[NSDocument](../nsdocument.md) automatically creates [NSUserActivity](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuseractivity) objects. The system makes user activities eligible for Handoff if the document is iCloud-based and the app’s `Info.plist` property list file includes a `CFBundleDocumentTypes` key of `NSUbiquitousDocumentUserActivityType`. The value of `NSUbiquitousDocumentUserActivityType` is a string that represents the [NSUserActivity](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuseractivity) object’s activity type. The document’s URL is in the [NSUserActivity](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuseractivity) object’s [userInfo](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuseractivity/userinfo) dictionary with the [NSUserActivityDocumentURLKey](../nsuseractivitydocumenturlkey.md).

In macOS, [NSUserActivity](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuseractivity) objects that [NSDocument](../nsdocument.md) manage automatically become current when any of the document window controller’s windows become main. Otherwise, you need to invoke [becomeCurrent()](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuseractivity/becomecurrent%28%29) at appropriate times.

AppKit automatically invalidates any [NSUserActivity](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuseractivity) objects that have no associated documents or responders.

You can use this property from any thread. It’s KVO-observable in case you share the [NSDocument](../nsdocument.md) object with other objects that need to be in sync as the document moves into and out of iCloud.
