## Discussion

When the value of this property is [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true), the combo box displays a vertical scroller; when the value is [false](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false), it does not. The default value of this property is [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true). Note that the scroller is displayed even if the pop-up list contains fewer items than will fit in the area specified for display.

If you set this property to [false](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false) and the combo box cell has more list items (either in its internal item list or from its data source) than are allowed by [numberOfVisibleItems](numberofvisibleitems.md), only a subset are displayed. The [NSComboBoxCell](../nscomboboxcell.md) `scroll...` methods can be used to position this subset within the pop-up list.
