## Discussion

A view must register what types it accepts via [registerForDraggedTypes(\_:)](../nsview/registerfordraggedtypes%28__%29.md).  Use that class method to get the file promise drag types that [NSFilePromiseReceiver](../nsfilepromisereceiver.md) can accept, in order to register a view to accept promised files. [NSFilePromiseReceiver](../nsfilepromisereceiver.md) can accept file promises from both the item-based [NSFilePromiseProvider](../nsfilepromiseprovider.md) and the non-item based API. If you don’t register all these drag types, you might not be notified about some file promise drags. Register using the following code:

**Swift**

```swift
view.registerForDraggedTypes(NSFilePromiseReceiver.readableDraggedTypes())
```

**Objective-C**

```objc
[view registerForDraggedTypes:[NSFilePromiseReceiver readableDraggedTypes]];
```

# readableDraggedTypes (Objective-C)
