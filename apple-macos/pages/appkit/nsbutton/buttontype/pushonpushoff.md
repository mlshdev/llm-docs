## Discussion

When [state](../state.md) is [on](../../nscontrol/statevalue/on.md), the button appears illuminated. If the button has borders, it may also appear recessed. A second click returns the button’s [state](../state.md) to [off](../../nscontrol/statevalue/off.md).

This option corresponds to the Push On Push Off type in Interface Builder’s Attributes Inspector.
