# NSButton.ButtonType.momentaryPushIn (Swift)

**Framework:** AppKit  
**Kind:** Case  
**Availability:** macOS

A button that illuminates when the user clicks it.

## Declaration

```swift
case momentaryPushIn
```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

This button type is the default.

This type of button is best for simply triggering actions, as it doesn’t show its state; it always displays its normal image or title.

Most buttons in macOS, such as the Cancel button in many dialogs, are momentary light buttons. If a user clicks one, it highlights briefly, triggers an action, and returns to its original state.

This option corresponds to the Momentary Push In type in Interface Builder’s Attributes Inspector.
