# NSButton.ButtonType.multiLevelAccelerator (Swift)

**Framework:** AppKit  
**Kind:** Case  
**Availability:** macOS 10.10.3+

A button that allows for a configurable number of stepped pressure levels and provides tactile feedback as the user reaches each step.

## Declaration

```swift
case multiLevelAccelerator
```

## Discussion

Use [maxAcceleratorLevel](../maxacceleratorlevel.md) to configure the number of pressure levels. For other types of buttons, this property value defaults to `1`. For multilevel accelerator buttons, this property value defaults to `2`, and you can set it to a value between `1` and `5`.

Like a normal accelerator button, the button sends an action when the user first clicks it. If [isContinuous](../../nscontrol/iscontinuous.md) is [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true), while the user clicks the button, it then sends actions at repeating intervals that are based on pressure. If [isContinuous](../../nscontrol/iscontinuous.md) is [false](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false), the button sends actions as the user presses harder and reaches different levels of pressure. The button sends a final action when the user releases the button.

The value of a multilevel accelerator button is distinct from its state. The [integerValue](../../nscontrol/integervalue.md) of a multilevel button is `0` when the user doesn’t click it or `1` through `5` when the user clicks it, depending on the level of pressure. If you set the value of a multilevel accelerator button explicitly, the button doesn’t send an action until pressure reaches the level you specify.

On a system that doesn’t support pressure sensitivity, a multilevel accelerator button’s value is always `1` when the user clicks it.

This option corresponds to the Multi Level Accelerator type in Interface Builder’s Attributes inspector.
