# appearance (Swift)

**Framework:** AppKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** macOS 10.14+

The appearance associated with the app’s windows.

## Declaration

```swift
var appearance: NSAppearance? { get set }
```

## Mentioned In

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

When the value of this property is `nil` (the default), AppKit applies the current system appearance to the app’s user interface elements, including its windows, views, panels, and popovers. Assigning an [NSAppearance](../nsappearance.md) object to this property causes the app’s interface elements to adopt the specified appearance instead.

Individual windows and views may still override the app’s appearance to customize their own appearance.

### Managing the app’s appearance

- [effectiveAppearance](effectiveappearance.md): The appearance that AppKit uses to draw the app’s interface.
- [currentSystemPresentationOptions](currentsystempresentationoptions.md): The set of app presentation options that are currently in effect for the system.
- [presentationOptions](presentationoptions-swift.property.md): The presentation options that should be in effect for the system when this app is active.
- [NSApplication.PresentationOptions](presentationoptions-swift.struct.md): Constants that control the presentation of the app, typically for fullscreen apps such as games or kiosks.
- [applicationShouldSuppressHighDynamicRangeContent](applicationshouldsuppresshighdynamicrangecontent.md): A boolean value indicating whether your application should suppress HDR content based on established policy. Built-in AppKit components such as NSImageView will automatically behave correctly with HDR content. You should use this value in conjunction with notifications (`NSApplicationShouldBeginSuppressingHighDynamicRangeContentNotification` and `NSApplicationShouldEndSuppressingHighDynamicRangeContentNotification`) to suppress HDR content in your application when signaled to do so.
