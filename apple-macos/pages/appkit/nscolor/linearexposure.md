# linearExposure (Swift)

**Framework:** AppKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** macOS 26.0+

For HDR colors, the linear brightness multiplier that was applied when generating the color. Colors created with an exposure by NSColor create CGColors that are tagged with a contentHeadroom value. While CGColors created without a contentHeadroom tag will return 0 from CGColorGetHeadroom, NSColors generated in a similar fashion return a linearExposure of 1.0.

## Declaration

```swift
var linearExposure: CGFloat { get }
```

### Supporting high dynamic range (HDR) colors

- [standardDynamicRange](standarddynamicrange.md): In some cases it is useful to recover the color that was base the SDR color that was exposed to generate an HDR color. If a color’s `linearExposure` is \> 1, then this will return the base SDR color. If the color is not an HDR color, this will return `self`.
- [applyingContentHeadroom(\_:)](applyingcontentheadroom%28__%29.md): Reinterpret the color by applying a new `contentHeadroom` without changing the color components. Changing the `contentHeadroom` redefines the color relative to a different peak white, changing its behavior under tone mapping and the result of calling `standardDynamicRangeColor`. The new color will have a `contentHeadroom` \>= 1.0. If called on a color with a color space that does not support extended range, or does not have an equivalent extended range counterpart, this will return `self`.
