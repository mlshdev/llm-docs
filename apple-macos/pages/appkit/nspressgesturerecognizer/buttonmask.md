# buttonMask (Swift)

**Framework:** AppKit

```

## Discussion

Bit 0 represents the primary button, bit 1 is the secondary button, and so on. So to track clicks of the secondary button, assign the value `0x2` (which corresponds to a `1` in bit 1) to this property. The default value of this property is `0x1`, which detects clicks in the primary mouse button.

Changing the value of this property also sets the values of the [delaysPrimaryMouseButtonEvents](../nsgesturerecognizer/delaysprimarymousebuttonevents.md), [delaysSecondaryMouseButtonEvents](../nsgesturerecognizer/delayssecondarymousebuttonevents.md), and [delaysOtherMouseButtonEvents](../nsgesturerecognizer/delaysothermousebuttonevents.md) properties to [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true) for each of the buttons you specified.

- [numberOfTouchesRequired](numberoftouchesrequired.md): The number of necessary touches on a Touch Bar for the gesture recognizer to match.
