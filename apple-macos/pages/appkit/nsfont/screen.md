## Discussion

For a font object that represents a scalable PostScript font, this property contains a bitmapped screen font matching the receiver in typeface and matrix (or size), or `nil` if such a font cannot be found. For a bitmapped screen font, the value in this property is `nil`.

Screen fonts are for direct use with the window server only. Never use them with Application Kit objects, such as in `setFont:` methods. Internally, the Application Kit automatically uses the corresponding screen font for a font object as long as the view is not rotated or scaled.
