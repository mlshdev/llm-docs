# representedObject (Swift)

**Framework:** AppKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** macOS 10.5+

The object whose value is presented in the receiver’s primary view.

## Declaration

```swift
var representedObject: Any? { get set }
```

## Discussion

This property *retains* the object you provide to it; it does not *copy* it. In another words, a view controller has a *to-one* relationship with its represented object and does not own it as an attribute.

The [representedObject](representedobject.md) property is key-value coding and key-value observing compliant. When you use the represented object as the file’s owner of a nib file, you can bind controls to the file’s owner using key paths that start with the string `representedObject`.
