# updateViewConstraints() (Swift)

**Framework:** AppKit  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** macOS 10.10+

Called during Auto Layout constraint updating to enable the view controller to mediate the process.

## Declaration

```swift
func updateViewConstraints()
```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

This method gets called, for example, when the user interacts with a view in a way that causes the layout to change. When called, the default implementation of this method in turn calls the [updateConstraints()](../nsview/updateconstraints%28%29.md) method on the view controller’s view.

You can override this method to update custom view constraints, as an alternative to subclassing the view controller’s view and overriding its [updateConstraints()](../nsview/updateconstraints%28%29.md) method.

If you override this method, you must call this method on `super` at some point in your implementation or call the [updateConstraints()](../nsview/updateconstraints%28%29.md) method on the view controller’s view.

This method is called only for apps that link against macOS 10.10 or later.

This method supports automatic observation tracking. For more information, see [Updating views automatically with observation tracking in AppKit](../updating-views-automatically-with-observation-tracking-in-appkit.md).

- [viewWillLayout()](viewwilllayout%28%29.md): Called just before the [layout()](../nsview/layout%28%29.md) method of the view controller’s view is called.
- [viewDidLayout()](viewdidlayout%28%29.md): Called immediately after the [layout()](../nsview/layout%28%29.md) method of the view controller’s view is called.
