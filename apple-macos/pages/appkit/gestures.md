# Gestures

**Interface languages:** Swift, Objective-C

**Framework:** AppKit  
**Kind:** API Collection

Encapsulate your app’s event-handling logic in gesture recognizers so that you can reuse that code throughout your app.

## Topics

### Standard Gestures

- [NSClickGestureRecognizer](nsclickgesturerecognizer.md): A discrete gesture recognizer that tracks a specified number of mouse clicks.
- [NSPressGestureRecognizer](nspressgesturerecognizer.md): A discrete gesture recognizer that tracks whether the user holds down a mouse button for a minimum amount of time before releasing it.
- [NSPanGestureRecognizer](nspangesturerecognizer.md): A continuous gesture recognizer for panning gestures.
- [NSRotationGestureRecognizer](nsrotationgesturerecognizer.md): A continuous gesture recognizer that tracks two trackpad touches moving opposite each other in a circular motion.
- [NSMagnificationGestureRecognizer](nsmagnificationgesturerecognizer.md): A continuous gesture recognizer that tracks a pinch gesture that magnifies content.

### Custom Gestures

- [NSGestureRecognizer](nsgesturerecognizer.md): An object that monitors events and calls its action method when a predefined sequence of events occur.
- [NSGestureRecognizerDelegate](nsgesturerecognizerdelegate.md): A set of methods for fine-tuning a gesture recognizer’s behavior.
