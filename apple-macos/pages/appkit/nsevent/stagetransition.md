# stageTransition (Swift)

**Framework:** AppKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** macOS 10.10.3+

The transition value for the stage of a pressure gesture event.

## Declaration

```swift
var stageTransition: CGFloat { get }
```

## Discussion

This property is specifically intended to provide a value for the transition animation between the stages of a pressure gesture event.

Gesture events of type [NSEvent.EventType.pressure](eventtype/pressure.md) go through stages, and transitions occur between these stages. This property indicates a transition value between the current stage and the next or prior stage.

This value is distinct from pressure. It immediately resets to `0` as soon as a stage transition occurs. However, this value does not then immediately begin to fluctuate. The value only starts to change as a new stage begins to approach. It then continues to rise or fall throughout the transition, until that new stage is reached.

As pressure increases for the gesture and a new stage approaches, this property provides a value between `0` and `1`, indicating the approach of the next stage. When pressure is reduced for the gesture and a new stage is approached, this property provides a value between `0` and `-1`, indicating the approach of the current stage’s release.
