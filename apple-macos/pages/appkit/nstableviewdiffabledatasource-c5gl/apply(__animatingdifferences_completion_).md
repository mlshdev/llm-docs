# apply(\_:animatingDifferences:completion:)

**Framework:** AppKit  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** macOS 11.0+

Updates the UI to reflect the state of the data in the specified snapshot, optionally animating the UI changes and executing a completion handler.

## Declaration

```swift
func apply(_ snapshot: NSDiffableDataSourceSnapshot<SectionIdentifierType, ItemIdentifierType>, animatingDifferences: Bool, completion: (() -> Void)? = nil)
```

## Parameters

- `snapshot`: The snapshot that reflects the new state of the data in the table view.
- `animatingDifferences`: If `true`, the diffable data source computes the difference between the table view’s current state and the new state in the snapshot, which is an O(*n*) operation, where *n* is the number of items in the snapshot. The system animates the differences in the UI between the current state and new state. If `false`, the system sets the table view UI to the new state without any animations, with no additional overhead for computing a diff. Any ongoing row animations are interrupted and the table view’s content immediately reloads.
- `completion`: The closure the system executes when the animations are complete. This closure has no return value and takes no parameters. The system calls this closure from the main queue.
