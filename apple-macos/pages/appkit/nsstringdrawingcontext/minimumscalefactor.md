# minimumScaleFactor (Swift)

**Framework:** AppKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** macOS 10.11+

The scale factor that determines the smallest font size to use during drawing.

## Declaration

```swift
var minimumScaleFactor: CGFloat { get set }
```

## Discussion

A value of `0.0` corresponds to a scale factor of `1.0`. Any value greater than `0.0` is multiplied by the font point size to get the smallest font size that is permissible to use. For example, 0.5 indicates a font that is half the size of the actual font, 0.75 is three-quarters of the font size, and so on. Typically, you specify a value between 0.0 and 1.0 to indicate how much the font can be shrunk during drawing.

The default value of this property is `0.0`.
