# instantiateController(identifier:creator:)

**Framework:** AppKit  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** macOS 10.15+

Creates the specified view controller from the storyboard and initializes it using your custom initialization code.

## Declaration

```swift
func instantiateController<Controller>(identifier: NSStoryboard.SceneIdentifier, creator: ((NSCoder) -> Controller?)? = nil) -> Controller where Controller : NSViewController
```

## Parameters

- `identifier`: A string that uniquely identifies the view controller in the storyboard file. At design time, put this same string in the Storyboard ID attribute of your view controller in Interface Builder. This identifier is not a property of the view controller object itself. The storyboard uses it to locate the appropriate data for your controller.

  If the specified identifier does not exist in the storyboard file, this method raises an exception.
- `creator`: A block that contains your custom creation code for the view controller. Use this block to create the view controller, initialize it with the provided coder object and any custom information you require, and return the result. This block returns a new view controller object and takes the following parameter:

  - **coder**: The coder object that contains the storyboard data to use when configuring the view controller.

  If you return `nil` from your block, this method creates the view controller using the default [init(coder:)](../nsviewcontroller/init%28coder_%29.md) method.

## Return Value

The view controller that corresponds to the specified identifier string. If no view controller has the given identifier, this method throws an exception.

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

Use this method to create a view controller object programmatically. Each time you call this method, it creates a new instance of the view controller using the block you provide.

In your `creator` block, create the view controller using your custom constructor method. Your custom initialization method must accept an [NSCoder](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nscoder) object as a parameter and must call the inherited [init(coder:)](../nsresponder/init%28coder_%29.md) method during its execution. Not doing so is a programmer error. After initializing the storyboard state, initialize your view controller’s custom properties.
