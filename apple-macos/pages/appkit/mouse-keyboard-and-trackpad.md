# Mouse, Keyboard, and Trackpad (Swift)

**Framework:** AppKit  
**Kind:** API Collection

Handle events related to mouse, keyboard, and trackpad input.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

The [NSResponder](nsresponder.md) class defines the responder chain, an ordered list of objects that respond to user events. When the user clicks the mouse button, taps on the trackpad, or presses a key, an event is generated and passed up the responder chain in search of an object that can respond to it. Any object that handles events must inherit from the [NSResponder](nsresponder.md) class. The core AppKit classes, [NSApplication](nsapplication.md), [NSWindow](nswindow.md), and [NSView](nsview.md), inherit from [NSResponder](nsresponder.md).

An [NSApplication](nsapplication.md) object maintains a list of [NSWindow](nswindow.md) objects—one for each window belonging to the app—and each [NSWindow](nswindow.md) object maintains a hierarchy of [NSView](nsview.md) objects. This view hierarchy is used for both drawing the user interface and for handling events.

An [NSWindow](nswindow.md) object handles window-level events and distributes other events to its views. An [NSWindow](nswindow.md) object also has a delegate allowing you to customize its behavior.

## Topics

### Responder Objects

- [NSResponder](nsresponder.md): An abstract class that forms the basis of event and command processing in AppKit.

### Mouse, Keyboard, and Touch Events

- [NSEvent](nsevent.md): An object that contains information about an input action, such as a mouse click or a key press.
- [NSTouch](nstouch.md): A snapshot of a particular touch at an instant in time.

### Trackpad

- [NSPressureConfiguration](nspressureconfiguration.md): An encapsulation of the behavior and progression of a Force Touch trackpad as it responds to specific events.
- [NSHapticFeedbackManager](nshapticfeedbackmanager.md): An object that provides access to the haptic feedback management attributes on a system with a Force Touch trackpad.

### Constants

- [NSEvent.EventTypeMask](nsevent/eventtypemask.md): Constants that you use to filter out specific event types from the stream of incoming events.
- [NSEvent.ButtonMask](nsevent/buttonmask-swift.struct.md): Constants you use to identify the activated tablet buttons in an event.
- [NSEvent.ModifierFlags](nsevent/modifierflags-swift.struct.md): Flags that represent key states in an event object.
- [NSEvent.Phase](nsevent/phase-swift.struct.md): Constants that represent the possible phases during an event phase.
- [NSEvent.SwipeTrackingOptions](nsevent/swipetrackingoptions.md): Constants that specify swipe-tracking options.
- [init(type:)](nsevent/eventtypemask/init%28type_%29.md): Returns the event mask for the specified type.

## See Also

### User Interactions

- [Menus, Cursors, and the Dock](menus-cursors-and-the-dock.md): Implement menus and cursors to facilitate interactions with your app, and use your app’s Dock tile to convey updated information.
- [Gestures](gestures.md): Encapsulate your app’s event-handling logic in gesture recognizers so that you can reuse that code throughout your app.
- [Touch Bar](touch-bar.md): Display interactive content and controls in the Touch Bar.
- [Drag and Drop](drag-and-drop.md): Support the direct manipulation of your app’s content using drag and drop.
- [Accessibility for AppKit](accessibility-for-appkit.md): Make your AppKit apps accessible to everyone who uses macOS.
