## Discussion

The `NSWorkspace` object then gets the status of all the files and directories it is interested in and updates itself appropriately. This method is used by many objects that write or delete files.

The `NSDocument` and `NSSavePanel` objects use this method when saving a file. If you create a file directly, you should call [noteFileSystemChanged](notefilesystemchanged.md) so that the Finder can update the folder if it is open.
