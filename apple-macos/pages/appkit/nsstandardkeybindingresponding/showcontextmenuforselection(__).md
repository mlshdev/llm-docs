# showContextMenuForSelection(\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** AppKit  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** macOS 15.0+

## Declaration

```swift
optional func showContextMenuForSelection(_ sender: Any?)
```

## Parameters

- `sender`: The object that originated the display of the context menu.

## Discussion

Present a context menu at the text cursor position, selection, or wherever is appropriate for your responder.

NSView has a default implementation of this method. For any view that returns a non-nil value from `-menuForEvent:`, the default implementation will display that menu automatically. The NSView implementation uses the `selectionAnchorRect` method in the `NSViewContentSelectionInfo` protocol to determine the location of the selection and of the menu. The NSView implementation determines the menu to display by calling `menuForEvent:` with a right-mouse-down event that is centered on the anchor rect. If `selectionAnchorRect` is not implemented, then the NSView implementation calls `menuForEvent` with a right-mouse-down event that is centered on the view’s bounds, and also displays the menu at that location.

You should only override this method in a custom view if you need full control over the display of a context menu from the keyboard or Accessibility, beyond what is provided by default by NSView.

If the view does not support a context menu, then you should call `[[self nextResponder] tryToPerform:_cmd with:sender]` to pass the request up the responder chain.

> **Note**

> In some cases, this method will be called without a prior call to `contextMenuKeyDown:`. This occurs when a view receives an Accessibility ShowMenu action, or when the user has created a Cocoa Text key binding to map a different key combination to the `showContextMenuForSelection:` action.
