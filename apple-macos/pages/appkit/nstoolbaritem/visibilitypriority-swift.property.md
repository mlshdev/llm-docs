# visibilityPriority (Swift)

**Framework:** AppKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.1+ · macOS

The display priority associated with the toolbar item.

## Declaration

```swift
var visibilityPriority: NSToolbarItem.VisibilityPriority { get set }
```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

The default value of this property is [standard](visibilitypriority-swift.struct/standard.md). Assign a higher priority to give preference to the toolbar item when space is limited.

When a toolbar doesn’t have enough space to fit all of its items, it pushes lower-priority items to the overflow menu first. When two or more items have the same priority, the toolbar removes them one at a time starting from the trailing edge.

### Getting the item’s configuration

- [isVisible](isvisible.md): A Boolean value that indicates whether the item is currently visible in the toolbar, and not in the overflow menu.
- [isHidden](ishidden.md): Determines whether an item is visible in the toolbar.
- [isBordered](isbordered.md): A Boolean value that indicates whether the toolbar item has a bordered style.
- [isNavigational](isnavigational.md): A Boolean value that indicates whether the item behaves as a navigation item in the toolbar.
- [isEnabled](isenabled.md): A Boolean value that indicates whether the item is enabled.
- [badge](badge-17r3r.md): A badge that can be attached to an NSToolbarItem. This provides a way to display small visual indicators that can be used to highlight important information, such as unread notifications or status indicators.
- [NSItemBadge](../nsitembadge-swift.struct.md): `NSItemBadge` represents a badge that can be attached to an `NSToolbarItem`.
- [style](style-swift.property.md): Defines the toolbar item’s appearance. The default style is plain. Prominent style tints the background. If a background tint color is set, it uses it; otherwise, it uses the app’s or system’s accent color. If grouped with other items, it moves to its own to avoid tinting other items’ background.
- [NSToolbarItem.Style](style-swift.enum.md)
- [NSToolbarItem.VisibilityPriority](visibilitypriority-swift.struct.md): Constants that indicate which toolbar items to keep in the toolbar when space is limited.
- [tag](tag.md): An integer tag you can use to identify the toolbar item.
