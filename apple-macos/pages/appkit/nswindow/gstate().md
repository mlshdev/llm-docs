# gState() (Swift)

**Framework:** AppKit  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** macOS 10.0+ (deprecated in 10.10)

Returns the window’s graphics state object.

> This method is unused and should not be called.

## Declaration

```swift
func gState() -> Int
```

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

The graphics state object associated with the window.

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

This graphics state is used by default for all `NSView` objects in the window’s view hierarchy, but individual views can be made to use their own with the `NSView` method [allocateGState()](../nsview/allocategstate%28%29.md).

### Methods

- [canStoreColor()](canstorecolor%28%29.md): Deprecated. Indicates whether the window has a depth limit that allows it to store color values.
- [enableFlushing()](enableflushing%28%29.md): Deprecated. Reenables the [flush()](flush%28%29.md) method for the window after it was disabled through a previous [disableFlushing()](disableflushing%28%29.md) message.
- [disableFlushing()](disableflushing%28%29.md): Deprecated. Disables the [flush()](flush%28%29.md) method for the window.
- [flush()](flush%28%29.md): Deprecated. Flushes the window’s offscreen buffer to the screen if the window is buffered and flushing is enabled.
- [flushIfNeeded()](flushifneeded%28%29.md): Deprecated. Flushes the window’s offscreen buffer to the screen if flushing is enabled and if the last [flush()](flush%28%29.md) message had no effect because flushing was disabled.
- [menuChanged(\_:)](menuchanged%28__%29.md): Deprecated. This method does nothing; it is here for backward compatibility.
- [cacheImage(in:)](cacheimage%28in_%29.md): Deprecated. Stores the window’s raster image from a given rectangle expressed in the window’s base coordinate system.
- [restoreCachedImage()](restorecachedimage%28%29.md): Deprecated. Splices the window’s cached image rectangles, if any, back into its raster image (and buffer if it has one), undoing the effect of any drawing performed within those areas since they were established using [cacheImage(in:)](cacheimage%28in_%29.md).
- [discardCachedImage()](discardcachedimage%28%29.md): Deprecated. Discards all of the window’s cached image rectangles.
- [useOptimizedDrawing(\_:)](useoptimizeddrawing%28__%29.md): Deprecated. Specifies whether the window is to optimize focusing and drawing when displaying its views.
- [init(windowRef:)](init%28windowref_%29.md): Deprecated. Returns a Cocoa window created from a Carbon window.
