# isReleasedWhenClosed (Swift)

**Framework:** AppKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** macOS

A Boolean value that indicates whether the window is released when it receives the `close` message.

## Declaration

```swift
var isReleasedWhenClosed: Bool { get set }
```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

The value of this property is [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true) if the window is automatically released after being closed; [false](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false) if it’s simply removed from the screen.

The default for `NSWindow` is [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true); the default for `NSPanel` is [false](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false). Release when closed, however, is ignored for windows owned by window controllers.

> **Warning**

> Swift and Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) clients need to set this property to [false](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false) to avoid releasing the window too many times.
