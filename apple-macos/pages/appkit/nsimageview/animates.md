# animates (Swift)

**Framework:** AppKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** macOS

A Boolean value indicating whether the image view automatically plays animated images.

## Declaration

```swift
var animates: Bool { get set }
```

## Discussion

When the value of this property is [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true), the image view plays animated images automatically using the timing and looping characteristics stored in the image data. The default value of this property is [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true).

Decoding an animated GIF file is the only way to create an animated [NSImage](../nsimage.md) object. If the image view has been assigned an image that was created from animated GIF data, setting this property to [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true) enables automatic playback of the animation. If this property is set to [false](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false), only the first frame of an animated image is displayed.

Loading an animated GIF file using an [NSImage](../nsimage.md) object produces an image that uses an [NSBitmapImageRep](../nsbitmapimagerep.md) object. The [currentFrame](../nsbitmapimagerep/propertykey/currentframe.md), [currentFrameDuration](../nsbitmapimagerep/propertykey/currentframeduration.md), and [frameCount](../nsbitmapimagerep/propertykey/framecount.md) properties of the bitmap image representation determine the timing and looping characteristics of the animation. For more information, see [NSBitmapImageRep](../nsbitmapimagerep.md).

- [imageFrameStyle](imageframestyle.md): The style of frame that appears around the image.
- [imageAlignment](imagealignment.md): The alignment of the cell’s image inside the image view.
- [imageScaling](imagescaling.md): The scaling mode applied to make the cell’s image fit the frame of the image view.
- [contentTintColor](contenttintcolor.md): A tint color to be used when rendering template image content.
