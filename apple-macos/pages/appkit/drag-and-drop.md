# Drag and Drop

**Interface languages:** Swift, Objective-C

**Framework:** AppKit  
**Kind:** API Collection

Support the direct manipulation of your app’s content using drag and drop.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

With very little programming on your part, custom-view objects can be dragged and dropped anywhere. Objects become part of this dragging mechanism by conforming to dragging protocols: Draggable objects conform to the [NSDraggingSource](nsdraggingsource.md) protocol, and destination objects (that is, receivers of a drop) conform to the [NSDraggingDestination](nsdraggingdestination.md) protocol. AppKit hides all the details of tracking the cursor and displaying the dragged image.

> **Note**

>  To learn how to adopt drag and drop in your iOS app, see [Drag and drop](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/drag-and-drop).

To learn how to use drag and drop for an image view, see [Supporting Drag and Drop Through File Promises](supporting-drag-and-drop-through-file-promises.md). To use drag and drop in a table view, see [Supporting Table View Drag and Drop Through File Promises](supporting-table-view-drag-and-drop-through-file-promises.md). For an example of drag and drop in a collection view, see [Supporting Collection View Drag and Drop Through File Promises](supporting-collection-view-drag-and-drop-through-file-promises.md), and for an outline view: [Navigating Hierarchical Data Using Outline and Split Views](navigating-hierarchical-data-using-outline-and-split-views.md).

## Topics

### Drag Sources

Originate content from a drag source by creating items to represent that content.

- [NSDraggingSource](nsdraggingsource.md): A set of methods that are implemented by the source object in a dragging session.
- [NSDraggingItem](nsdraggingitem.md): A single dragged item within a dragging session.
- [NSDraggingSession](nsdraggingsession.md): An object that encapsulates a drag-and-drop action.
- [NSDraggingImageComponent](nsdraggingimagecomponent.md): A single object in a dragging item.

### Drop Targets

Receive dragged content in your app’s objects.

- [NSDraggingDestination](nsdraggingdestination.md): A set of methods that the destination object (or recipient) of a dragged image must implement.
- [NSDraggingInfo](nsdragginginfo.md): A set of methods that supply information about a dragging session.
- [NSSpringLoadingDestination](nsspringloadingdestination.md): A set of methods that the destination object (or recipient) of a dragged object can implement to support spring-loading.
