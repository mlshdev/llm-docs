# didChangeText() (Swift)

**Framework:** AppKit  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** macOS

Sends out necessary notifications when a text change completes.

## Declaration

```swift
func didChangeText()
```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

Invoked automatically at the end of a series of changes, this method posts an [didChangeNotification](../nstext/didchangenotification.md) to the default notification center, which also results in the delegate receiving an `NSText` delegate [textDidChange(\_:)](../nstextdelegate/textdidchange%28__%29.md) message.

Subclasses implementing methods that change their text should invoke this method at the end of those methods. See [Subclassing NSTextView](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/TextFonts/Conceptual/CocoaTextArchitecture/TextEditing/TextEditing.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009459-CH3-SW16) for more information.
