# commands (Swift)

**Framework:** AppKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** macOS

An array of strings defining the commands for which the speech recognizer object should listen.

## Declaration

```swift
var commands: [String]? { get set }
```

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

Setting this property when the speech recognizer is already listening means that the current command list is updated and listening continues. The items in the array should be [NSString](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsstring) objects. The command strings must match the current locale of the recognizer, which is selected in the Dictation pane of Accessibility system preferences.

- [displayedCommandsTitle](displayedcommandstitle.md): The title of the commands section in the Speech Commands window or `nil` if there is no title.
- [listensInForegroundOnly](listensinforegroundonly.md): A Boolean value that indicates whether the speech recognizer object should only enable its commands when its application is the frontmost one.
- [blocksOtherRecognizers](blocksotherrecognizers.md): A Boolean value that indicates whether the speech recognizer object should block all other recognizers (that is, other applications attempting to understand spoken commands) when listening.
