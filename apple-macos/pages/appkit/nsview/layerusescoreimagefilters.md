# layerUsesCoreImageFilters (Swift)

**Framework:** AppKit  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** macOS 10.9+

A Boolean value indicating whether the view’s layer uses Core Image filters and needs in-process rendering.

## Declaration

```swift
var layerUsesCoreImageFilters: Bool { get set }
```

## Discussion

If your view uses a custom layer and you assigned Core Image to that layer directly, you must set this property to [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true) to let AppKit know of that fact. In macOS 10.9 and later, AppKit prefers to render layer trees out-of-process but cannot do so if any layers have Core Image filters attached to them. Specifying [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true) for property lets AppKit know that it must move rendering of the layer hierarchy back into your app’s process. If the value of this property is [false](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false), adding a filter to the view’s layer triggers an exception.

You do not need to modify this property if you assigned the filters using the [backgroundFilters](backgroundfilters.md), [compositingFilter](compositingfilter.md), or [contentFilters](contentfilters.md) properties of the view. Those methods automatically let AppKit know that it needs to render the layer hierarchy in-process. Set it only if you set the filters on the layer directly.
