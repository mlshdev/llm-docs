## Discussion

In the simple case, a view is sent [viewWillStartLiveResize()](viewwillstartliveresize%28%29.md) before the first resize operation on the containing window and [viewDidEndLiveResize()](viewdidendliveresize%28%29.md) after the last resize operation. A view that is repeatedly added and removed from a window during live resize will receive only one [viewWillStartLiveResize()](viewwillstartliveresize%28%29.md) (on the first time it is added to the window) and one [viewDidEndLiveResize()](viewdidendliveresize%28%29.md) (when the window has completed the live resize operation). This allows a superview such as [NSBrowser](../nsbrowser.md) object to add and remove its [NSMatrix](../nsmatrix.md) subviews during live resize without the `NSMatrix` receiving multiple calls to these methods.

A view might allocate data structures to cache-drawing information in [viewWillStartLiveResize()](viewwillstartliveresize%28%29.md) and should clean up these data structures in [viewDidEndLiveResize()](viewdidendliveresize%28%29.md). In addition, a view that does optimized drawing during live resize might need to do full drawing after [viewDidEndLiveResize()](viewdidendliveresize%28%29.md). However, you should not assume that a view has a drawing context in [viewDidEndLiveResize()](viewdidendliveresize%28%29.md) (since it may have been removed from the window during live resize). A view that needs to redraw itself after live resize should set its [needsDisplay](needsdisplay.md) property to [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true) in [viewDidEndLiveResize()](viewdidendliveresize%28%29.md).

A view subclass should call `super` from these methods.

- [getRectsExposedDuringLiveResize(\_:count:)](getrectsexposedduringliveresize%28__count_%29.md): Returns a list of rectangles indicating the newly exposed areas of the view.
- [rectPreservedDuringLiveResize](rectpreservedduringliveresize.md): The rectangle identifying the portion of your view that did not change during a live resize operation.
- [viewWillStartLiveResize()](viewwillstartliveresize%28%29.md): Informs the view of the start of a live resize—the user has started resizing the view.
