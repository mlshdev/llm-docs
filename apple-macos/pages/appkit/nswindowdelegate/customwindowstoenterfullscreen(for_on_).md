# customWindowsToEnterFullScreen(for:on:) (Swift)

**Framework:** AppKit  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** macOS 10.9+

Called when the window is about to enter full-screen mode.

## Declaration

## Return Value

An array of windows to use for the animation to full-screen mode for `window`; otherwise `nil`.

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

This method lets a window delegate customize the animation when the window is about to enter full-screen mode by providing a custom window or windows containing layers or other effects. If you don’t want to perform custom animation, you can omit the implementation of this method, or it can return `nil`.

### Special Considerations

If this method and [customWindowsToEnterFullScreen(for:)](customwindowstoenterfullscreen%28for_%29.md) are both implemented, this method is called.
