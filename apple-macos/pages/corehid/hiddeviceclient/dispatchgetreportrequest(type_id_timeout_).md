# dispatchGetReportRequest(type:id:timeout:)

**Framework:** Core HID  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** macOS 15.0+

Send a get report request to the device over the transport.

## Declaration

```swift
func dispatchGetReportRequest(type: HIDReportType, id: HIDReportID? = nil, timeout: Duration? = nil) async throws -> Data
```

## Parameters

- `type`: The [HIDReportType](../hidreporttype.md) of the requested report.
- `id`: The ID of the requested report, determined from the report descriptor. This is unnecessary if the descriptor has only one report.
- `timeout`: The maximum amount of time to wait for the device to receive the report before the call times out and fails. Not providing a duration causes the call to wait forever.

## Return Value

The data that the device returned. Reference the device’s [descriptor](descriptor.md) to determine what data the device may respond with.

## Discussion

Many HID devices respond to get report requests to retrieve information from the device. Exactly how a device responds to a get report request is dependent on the device specific implementation, but most devices conform to the reports that they declare in their report [descriptor](descriptor.md). This function throws if the device is seized by another client.

For more details, see [Human Interface Devices (HID) Specifications and Tools](https://www.usb.org/hid).

> **Throws**

> [HIDDeviceError](../hiddeviceerror.md) if there is an issue with the request.
