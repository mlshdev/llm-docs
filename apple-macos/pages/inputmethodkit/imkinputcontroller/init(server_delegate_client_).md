# init(server:delegate:client:) (Swift)

**Framework:** InputMethodKit  
**Kind:** Initializer  
**Availability:** macOS 10.5+

Initializes the input control by setting the delegate.

## Declaration

```swift
init!(server: IMKServer!, delegate: Any!, client inputClient: Any!)
```

## Parameters

- `server`: The server object for the controller.
- `delegate`: The delegate object.
- `inputClient`: The client object that will send messages to the controller using the server object. The client object must confirm to the `IMKTextInput` protocol.

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

The initialized input controller object.

## Discussion

Methods in the [IMKStateSetting](../imkstatesetting.md) and [IMKMouseHandling](../imkmousehandling.md) protocols that are implemented by the delegate object always include a client parameter. Methods in the `IMKInputController` class do not need to take a client  because the `initWithServer:delegate:client:` method stores the client object you supply as an ivar when it initializes the `IMKInputController` object.

# initWithServer:delegate:client: (Objective-C)

**Framework:** InputMethodKit  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** macOS 10.5+

```

## Parameters

- `server`: The server object for the controller.
- `delegate`: The delegate object.
- `inputClient`: The client object that will send messages to the controller using the server object. The client object must confirm to the `IMKTextInput` protocol.
