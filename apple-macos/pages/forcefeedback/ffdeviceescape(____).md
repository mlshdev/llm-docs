# FFDeviceEscape(\_:\_:) (Swift)

**Framework:** Force Feedback  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.2+

Sends a hardware-specific command to the device.

## Declaration

```swift
func FFDeviceEscape(_ deviceReference: FFDeviceObjectReference!, _ pFFEffectEscape: UnsafeMutablePointer<FFEFFESCAPE>!) -> HRESULT
```

## Parameters

- `deviceReference`: An opaque reference handle to a device object. This is obtained from a previous call to FFCreateDevice.
- `pFFEffectEscape`: Pointer to FFEFFESCAPE structure that describes the command to be sent. On success, the cbOutBuffer member contains the number of bytes of the output buffer used.

## Return Value

If the method succeeds, the return value is FF_OK. If the method fails, the return value can be one of the following error values:

## Discussion

FFERR_INVALIDPARAM

FFERR_UNSUPPORTED

## Discussion

Because each driver implements different escapes, it is the application’s responsibility to ensure that it is sending the escape to the correct driver.

- [FFDeviceGetForceFeedbackProperty(\_:\_:\_:\_:)](ffdevicegetforcefeedbackproperty%28________%29.md): Gets properties that define the device behavior.
- [FFDeviceGetForceFeedbackState(\_:\_:)](ffdevicegetforcefeedbackstate%28____%29.md): Retrieves the state of the device’s force feedback system.
- [FFDeviceReleaseEffect(\_:\_:)](ffdevicereleaseeffect%28____%29.md): Disposes of an API effect object created with FFDeviceCreateEffect.

- [FFEffectDownload(\_:)](ffeffectdownload%28__%29.md): Places the effect on the device. If the effect is already on the device, the existing effect is updated to match the values set by the FFEffectSetParameters method.

- [FFEffectGetEffectStatus(\_:\_:)](ffeffectgeteffectstatus%28____%29.md): Sends a hardware-specific command to the driver.
- [FFEffectGetParameters(\_:\_:\_:)](ffeffectgetparameters%28______%29.md): Retrieves information about an effect.
- [FFEffectSetParameters(\_:\_:\_:)](ffeffectsetparameters%28______%29.md): Sets the characteristics of an effect.
- [FFEffectStart(\_:\_:\_:)](ffeffectstart%28______%29.md): Begins playing an effect. If the effect is already playing, it is restarted from the beginning. If the effect has not been downloaded or has been modified since its last download, it is downloaded before being started. This default behavior can be suppressed by passing the FFES_NODOWNLOAD flag.
