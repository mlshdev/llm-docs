For information on the compatibility requirements for Xcode 12.5, see [Xcode 12.5 Release Notes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-12_5-release-notes).

#### Deprecations

- Don’t use the iOS [MinimumOSVersion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information-property-list/minimumosversion) information property list key to declare the minimum release of macOS in which your app runs. Use [LSMinimumSystemVersion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information-property-list/lsminimumsystemversion) instead. (73890473)

  - Future releases of macOS ignore the `MinimumOSVersion` key in Mac apps, including apps built with Mac Catalyst.
  - Future releases of macOS use the `LSMinimumSystemVersion` key in iOS apps built with Xcode 12.5 or later. If an iOS app doesn’t include an `LSMinimumSystemVersion` key, future releases of macOS compare the app’s `MinimumOSVersion` with the version of its Mac Catalyst runtime to determine compatibility.
