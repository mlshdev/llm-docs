#### Resolved Issues

- The system now registers tickets stapled to installer packages that aren’t scanned by Gatekeeper. As a result, newly installed kernel extensions load properly when internet access is unavailable, which can occur if a user launches installation from a local folder or an enterprise uses automated tools to deploy an installer. If you’re deploying an app to macOS Mojave 10.14.5, follow the workaround listed in the *Known Issues* section of [macOS Mojave 10.14.5 Release Notes](macos-mojave-10_14_5-release-notes.md).
