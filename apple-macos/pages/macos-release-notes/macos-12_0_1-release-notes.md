# macOS Monterey 12.0.1 Release Notes

**Kind:** Article

Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

The macOS 12 SDK provides support to develop apps for Mac computers running macOS Monterey 12.0.1. The SDK comes bundled with Xcode 13.1, available from the Mac App Store. For information on the compatibility requirements for Xcode 13.1, see [Xcode 13.1 Release Notes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-13_1-release-notes).

#### Known Issues

- There might be issues with wakeup when dual monitors are connected. (79839446)

  **Workaround:** Connect the power adapter that came with the Mac.

#### Known Issues

- `NSExpression` immediately forbids certain operations that have significant side effects, like creating and destroying objects. Additionally, casting string class names into Class objects with `NSConstantValueExpression` is deprecated. (84017178)

  **Workaround:** Pass temporary objects to `NSExpression` in the context parameter of [expressionValue(with:context:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsexpression/expressionvalue%28with:context:%29), or with `NSPredicate` as the `substitutionVariables` parameter of [evaluate(with:substitutionVariables:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nspredicate/evaluate%28with:substitutionvariables:%29). You can create a derived predicate with all the substitution variables replaced (bound), using [withSubstitutionVariables(\_:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nspredicate/withsubstitutionvariables%28_:%29) on an existing `NSPredicate` so that code using the object can continue to use a simple `evaluate(with object: Any?)` invocation.

<a id="Deprecations"></a>

#### Deprecations

- Support for cleartext HTTP URL schemes for Proxy Automatic Configuration (PAC) is now deprecated. Use only HTTPS URL schemes for PAC. This affects all PAC configurations, including, but not limited to, configurations set via Settings, System Preferences, profiles, and `URLSession` APIs such as [connectionProxyDictionary](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsessionconfiguration/connectionproxydictionary) and [CFNetworkExecuteProxyAutoConfigurationURL(\_:\_:\_:\_:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/cfnetwork/cfnetworkexecuteproxyautoconfigurationurl%28_:_:_:_:%29). If you configure a cleartext HTTP PAC URL, the system may upgrade it to HTTPS during PAC file loads. Web Proxy Auto-Discovery (WPAD) Protocol via DNS isn’t affected. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Option 252 WPAD may attempt to upgrade cleartext HTTP URLs to HTTPS during PAC file loads. (61981845)

### SharePlay

<a id="Deprecations"></a>

#### Deprecations

- SharePlay development in macOS Monterey beta 6 and upcoming beta releases requires the installation of an updated [SharePlay Development Profile](https://developer.apple.com/download/). This profile enables successful creation and reception of GroupSessions via the Group Activities API in iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and tvOS 15 beta 7, as well as macOS Monterey beta 6. (81900143)

#### Known Issues

- Applications linking to RealityKit with the iOS 15 or macOS 12 SDKs will fail to launch on a previous OS. (79584511)
