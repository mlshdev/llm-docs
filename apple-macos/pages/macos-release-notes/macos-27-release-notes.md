# macOS 27 Golden Gate RC Release Notes

**Kind:** Article

Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

The macOS 27 SDK provides support to develop apps for Mac computers running macOS 27 Golden Gate RC. The SDK comes bundled with Xcode 27, available from the Mac App Store. For information on the compatibility requirements for Xcode 27, see [Xcode 27 Release Notes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Xcode-Release-Notes/xcode-27-release-notes).

<a id="General"></a>

### General

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: If you installed Xcode 27 beta on macOS Tahoe 26.5.1 and earlier, macOS virtual machine installation will fail due to a known bug. To restore virtual machine installation functionality, follow the [How to reinstall macOS guide](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102655). (179068335)

<a id="Accessory-Access"></a>

### Accessory Access

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: Accessory Access does not work inside App Sandbox. (176815987)
- Fixed: The Accessory Access framework is not supported within a macOS virtual machine. (177390971)

<a id="AirPods-Max-2"></a>

### AirPods Max 2

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: You cannot update AirPods Max 2 firmware beta in iOS 27 Beta 1 and macOS 27 Beta 1. AirPods Max 2 firmware beta updates are supported in iOS 27 Beta 2 and macOS 27 Beta 2. (178280323)

<a id="AirPort-Utility"></a>

### AirPort Utility

<a id="Deprecations"></a>

#### Deprecations

- AirPort Utility is no longer included with new clean installations of macOS. However, if you update macOS when AirPort Utility is already installed, it remains on your system but functionality is not guaranteed starting in macOS 27. (158248382)

<a id="APFS"></a>

### APFS

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: High-RAM Macs running macOS 27 Golden Gate Beta might erroneously report filesystem metadata corruption that doesn’t actually exist when running First Aid in Disk Utility or an equivalent operation. (182156751)

<a id="App-Intents"></a>

### App Intents

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- You can now pass a name parameter of type `AttributedString` to the `notes.createNote` and `notes.updateNote` schemas. (173431080)

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: Default values from schemas might not be applied for parameters that are of “Set” type. (175534195)
- Fixed: Requests that should result in an app’s `reminders.updateReminder`-conforming intent to be called might fail with “ cannot be used for this action right now.” (181212609) (FB23526663)
- Fixed: AppEntity instances have a cumulative size limit of 10MB, including all child properties and their values. Your app might crash if an entity exceeds this limit, and the exception is logged. (181763422)
- Fixed: The notes.appendText schema erroneously disappeared from the SDK. (182532125)

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- If you adopt the Audio App Schema domain, you might have trouble playing your content using Siri. (177198033)

  **Workaround:** Adopt an IntentValueQuery that takes the AudioSearch input, or index your entities in Spotlight.
- Existing entities that conformed to @AppEntity(schema: .photos.asset) in prior releases might no longer compile in the 27 SDKs because new properties were added to the schema in this release. (181800016) (FB23652582)

  **Workaround:** To continue conforming to the schema, adopt the additional properties and move the code behind an availability check.

<a id="Deprecations"></a>

#### Deprecations

- The `calendar.deleteEvents` schema has been renamed to `calendar.deleteEvent`. (176751155)

<a id="AppKit"></a>

### AppKit

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- The Recents list in the open and save panels can be accessed with the keyboard shortcut cmd-shift-f. (120442314)
- Window \> Move & Resize and Window \> Full Screen Tile menus can be used to move, resize, open and save panels that are not displayed as a sheet. (150791154)
- In macOS 27.0, AppKit adds `NSRefreshController`, providing pull-to-refresh functionality for `NSScrollView`. You can set it with `NSScrollView.refreshController`, configure a target or action to handle user-initiated refreshes, and call `endRefreshing` when the refresh completes or `beginRefreshing` to start one programmatically. (160867808)
- `NSToolbarItemGroup` adds the `role` property and the `NSToolbarItemGroupRole` enum, allowing toolbar item groups to be tagged with a semantic role. `NSSegmentedControl` similarly adds a `role` property and the `NSSegmentedControlRole` enum, including a `tabs` role for controls that represent tab-based navigation and content selection. With this role, controls are read by VoiceOver as “tabs” and have a distinct visual appearance. This distinguishes the segmented control from others that represent value selection — for example, a text alignment control in an inspector. (162577742)
- `NSTextSelectionManager` provides common text selection interactions (click, drag, shift-click, double/triple-click word/line/paragraph selection) to a `NSView` with a set of `NSGestureRecognizers` rather than overriding `NSEvent` mouse methods. `NSTextView` now uses `NSTextSelectionManager` and provides its own set of `NSGestureRecognizers` to provide additional features in addition to text selection. Existing `NSTextView` subclasses that override `mouseDown: ` continue to work through a binary-compatible fallback path. (163365571)
- In macOS 27.0, menu bar and context menus present a reduced set of menu item images, similar to the behavior prior to macOS 26.0. By default, `NSMenu` hides all menu item symbol images — non-symbol images remain visible. For menu items created from a xib file, `NSMenu` also observes the value of the “macOS 26.0 only” checkbox in the menu item inspector. If this checkbox is unchecked, the menu item image remains visible; if checked, it is hidden. These changes in menu item image visibility apply to applications linked on macOS 26.0 and later. Review the updated Human Interface Guidelines to determine which menu items in your app should still display images. Use the new `preferredImageVisibility` property on `NSMenuItem` to customize the image visibility for your menu items. As in macOS 26.0, `NSMenu` automatically provides default visible menu item images for certain common system-wide menu items, such as Settings, Share, and Print. (170477566)
- NSTextView’s `menuForEvent:` now returns a context menu in which the Layout Orientation menu item, and its submenu, are located inside the Font submenu. Because this change can cause compatibility issues with some shipping applications, it applies only to applications linked on the macOS 27 SDK. For applications linked on earlier SDKs, the Layout Orientation menu item remains at the top level of the context menu. (177605020)
- When an app is linked on macOS 27.0 or later, `NSTitlebarAccessoryViewController` is now allowed to draw outside its bounds by default, supporting effects such as shadows and interactive glass effects. During reveal animations, accessories might be clipped for the duration of the animation or when the accessory is `hidden`. (180962967) (FB23481212)

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: In apps built with the macOS 27.0 SDK, setting `allowedContentTypes` and `treatsFilePackagesAsDirectories` on `NSOpenPane` updates `canChooseFiles` and `canChooseDirectories` based on whether the requested types are file or directory types. (6938919)
- Fixed: Keyboard focus and tab order in expanded and collapsed open/save panels might not traverse all fields and controls — including the accessory view — in the expected order. (43112307)
- Fixed: The Web Safe Colors list displays incorrectly in right-to-left layout. (107870015)
- Fixed: Subclasses of `NSTextContentManager` cannot be instantiated due to internal class-cluster initialization assumptions, preventing apps from defining custom content managers. (115247760) (FB13146578)
- Fixed: An `NSTextField` configured as selectable but not editable draws its text outside the field’s bounds when text truncation is enabled. (118196071) (FB13354582)
- Fixed: `NSAlert` buttons erroneously allow `bezelColor` customization. (132024038)
- Fixed: When an allowed file type has multiple valid extensions — for example, `.htm` and `.html` — `NSSavePanel` appends additional file extensions to the saved filename. (140307283)
- Fixed: `NSScrollView` displays the system scroll edge effect when the scroll view has no visible scrollers. (159019809) (FB19853927)
- Fixed: An `NSSegmentedCell` draws incorrectly under the Liquid Glass appearance, with the control rendering at the wrong location. (168066807) (FB21616308)
- Fixed: A subclass of `NSSegmentedCell` that overrides label drawing does not take charge of drawing labels, with the system drawing the default labels instead. (169126818) (FB21791717)
- Fixed: When full keyboard navigation is off, the keyboard loop might not traverse the correct fields and controls. (169837566)
- `NSClickGestureRecognizers` with a click count greater than 1 will send an action before their multi-click timeout has elapsed. (173975472)
- Fixed: An `NSTextField` whose `textColor` is set to `nil` displays inconsistent text colors while in editing mode. (175095850) (FB22546245)
- Fixed: `-[NSFilePromiseReceiver receivePromisedFilesAtDestination:options:operationQueue:reader:]` asserts that it is called during `-prepareForDragOperation:`, `-performDragOperation:`, or `-concludeDragOperation:`. If `receivePromisedFilesAtDestination:...` is called at other times, your application will throw an exception and terminate. (176048351)
- Fixed: The base `NSGestureRecognizer` implementation of `locationInView:` previously returned the current mouse location converted into the view’s coordinate system, which is incorrect for touch-driven gestures. It now returns `NSZeroPoint` and logs an error pointing the developer at the missing override. Custom `NSGestureRecognizer` subclasses must provide their own `locationInView:` implementation. (176395420)
- Fixed: Some NSMenu APIs, such as `highlightedItem`, will not work in context menus. (178288949)
- Fixed: For applications linked on the macOS 27 SDK, both symbol and non-symbol menu item images are now automatically hidden. For applications linked on earlier SDKs, non-symbol images remain automatically visible, preserving compatibility with existing application behavior. This change allows applications to rely on system behavior for determining menu item image visibility, regardless of whether an image is a symbol image or a non-symbol image. If necessary, applications should use the `preferredImageVisibility` API to ensure that menu item images remain visible. (179374305) (FB23070183)
- Fixed: For applications linked on SDKs prior to macOS 27, NSMenu now automatically shows menu item images if the menu item title and attributed title are both empty. This preserves existing application behavior when the image is the only representation of the menu item content. When linking against the macOS 27 SDK, these images will automatically be hidden; a menu with this design should use the `preferredImageVisibility` API to ensure that the menu item images remain visible. (179936632)

<a id="Apple-Intelligence-Report"></a>

### Apple Intelligence Report

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: When you view Apple Intelligence Report entries for Home Intelligence, some data that was sent to Private Cloud Compute won’t appear in the report. (176056930)

<a id="Apple-Unified-Logging-System"></a>

### Apple Unified Logging System

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- Unified Logging System archives generated on 27.0 releases cannot be read on macOS 26.1 or earlier due to an updated archive format. macOS 26.2 or later is required to read these archives. (160567675)

<a id="Automatic-Assessment-Configuration"></a>

### Automatic Assessment Configuration

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- You can now use a more flexible and granular Automatic Assessment Configuration in macOS 27, giving you greater control over your testing environment with controls for the Dock, Menu Bar, and accessibility settings, plus built-in system pre-checks and app launch restrictions. (158132137)

<a id="AVFAudio"></a>

### AVFAudio

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: AudioDSP might crash when audio device properties change. (163978549)

<a id="Background-Assets"></a>

### Background Assets

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- You can reduce your app’s storage usage with localized asset packs. The system delivers the appropriately localized asset packs based on the user’s preferred languages. (163944365)

<a id="Communication-Safety"></a>

### Communication Safety

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: Sensitive QRCode detected as non-sensitive, preventing 3rd party developers from testing API functionality. (183962032)

<a id="Core-AI"></a>

### Core AI

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- iOS 27 includes Neural Engine improvements for Apple Intelligence capable devices. The system now restricts background access to the Neural Engine, similar to GPU usage restrictions. Large model loading (over 1 GB) performance is improved on the Neural Engine. Neural Engine memory usage is now attributed to your app process instead of the system, and appears in the Allocations instrument. (174796039)
- Access to the Neural engine when your app is in the background requires the new entitlement: “com.apple.developer.background-tasks.continued-processing.inference”. (179282606)

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: `AIModelCache` entries might not honor the cache policy you provide, causing re-specialization to occur more often than expected. (169746264)
- Fixed: When inference runs on the GPU, `InferenceFunction.encode` blocks until all compute is complete instead of returning as soon as encoding is done, unless the model is specialized with a preferred compute device of GPU. (175789258)
- Fixed: Certain weight and activation configurations may not run on the Neural Engine, such as FP8-quantized weights and activations, palettized weights with quantized (non-Float16) values, and sparse weights. Affected models may run on the CPU or GPU instead. (176210080)
- Fixed: When you run `InferenceFunction.run` on functions with both state arguments and outputs with dynamic shapes, the framework might be unable to infer the shape of the outputs and throw an error. (176807213)
- Fixed: On-device specialization fails when loading an `.aimodel` converted with `coreai-torch` v0.4.0. (177008303)
- Fixed: Inference might fail or crash for models with control flow over dynamic-shape tensors (for example, linear-attention LLMs such as Qwen3.5/3.6). (177354777)
- Fixed: Ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation might fail unexpectedly for certain models. (177729331)
- Fixed: When Metal API Validation is enabled, CoreAI models might fail to execute. (177991751)
- Fixed: Models with custom Metal kernels will fail to load. (178056451)
- Fixed: App-group support might not work as expected on certain model types. (179732320)
- Fixed: On-device specialization might fail when loading an `.aimodelc` compiled ahead of time using Xcode 27 Beta 2 or earlier. (181264112)

<a id="Core-Spotlight"></a>

### Core Spotlight

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- Creating a SpotlightSearchTool without a configuration and using it with a LanguageModelSession backed by the on-device system language model fails with an error reporting that the number of tokens provided exceeds the maximum allowed. The tool’s default configuration is sized for models with large context windows, so the tool’s description and parameter schema alone exceed the on-device model’s context window before any prompt is added. (183770678)

  **Workaround:** Configure the tool with a focused guide, which uses a compact schema sized for the on-device model:

  ```
    let configuration = SpotlightSearchTool.Configuration(
      sources: [.coreSpotlight],
      guide: .focused()
    )
    let tool = SpotlightSearchTool(configuration: configuration)
  ```

  To search a specific kind of content, pass a domain: `.focused(.communications)`, `.focused(.calendar)`, `.focused(.documents)`, `.focused(.visualMedia)`, or `.focused(.audio)`. A focused guide exposes a smaller set of search capabilities than the default configuration. Sessions backed by a model with a larger context window can continue to use the default configuration.

<a id="CoreStorage"></a>

### CoreStorage

<a id="Deprecations"></a>

#### Deprecations

- Encrypted HFS+ (CoreStorage) is deprecated and will not be supported in a future version of macOS. If you use Encrypted HFS+ backups on external drives, begin backing up to encrypted APFS-formatted external drives instead. (175892420)

<a id="Deprecation-Information"></a>

### Deprecation Information

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- Intel-based applications that will no longer run in macOS 28.0 now display a treatment in Get Info. (169548657)

<a id="Disk-Images"></a>

### Disk Images

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- The new DiskImageKit framework provides Swift APIs for creating and managing standalone and stacked disk images in the Apple Sparse Image Format (ASIF) and raw disk image formats, for use with the Virtualization framework via `VZDiskImageStorageDeviceAttachment`. See `DiskImageKit` for more information. (177868758)

<a id="Dock"></a>

### Dock

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: While using an app in full screen, the Dock might persist when entering and exiting Mission Control. (174992242)
- Fixed: The Dock might incorrectly indicate that some applications (such as Device Hub) are running in the background when they are not. (179502922)

<a id="Drag-and-Drop"></a>

### Drag and Drop

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: When you call `enumerateDraggingItemsWithOptions:...` during `draggingSession:willBeginAtPoint:`, the returned `NSDraggingItem` might have an incorrect `draggingFrame` value. (177839494)

<a id="DVDPlayback"></a>

### DVDPlayback

<a id="Deprecations"></a>

#### Deprecations

- The `DVDPlayback ` framework has been removed from the macOS 27 Golden Gate SDK and apps cannot build against it. The framework will be removed in a future macOS release. (179136240)

<a id="EcosystemUI"></a>

### EcosystemUI

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- Settings \> General now lists Intel-based apps that will be incompatible with macOS 28.0. The list also identifies unused Intel-based software discovered on the system. The system might suggest a website where an Apple silicon native version can be found for a listed app. (175697313)

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: The Intel-based apps view might unexpectedly display “Additional components” when the primary app is not native. (175781938)
- Fixed: Intel-based apps might appear erroneously in the unsupported apps list with the entry “Steam Game”. Games should not appear in this list, and the “Steam Game” entry can be safely ignored. (177192993)

<a id="Finder"></a>

### Finder

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: Suggested names for a file or folder might be more generic than its contents. For example, a folder containing only bird photos might receive suggestions like “Wildlife” or “Animal Photos” rather than bird-specific names. (178093786)

<a id="First-Party-App-Search"></a>

### First-Party App Search

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: Search assets might download slowly for languages and regions other than English and the United States, causing degraded search experiences for first-party apps up to a few hours after you install or upgrade to the latest OS, change your device language, or region. (178186226)

<a id="Foundation"></a>

### Foundation

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: `+[NSURL URLWithString:]` no longer double-encodes the `%` of valid percent-escape sequences when encoding other invalid characters. (161588649) (FB20439045)

<a id="Foundation-Models"></a>

### Foundation Models

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: When using the on-device Apple Foundation Model for both tool calling and guided generation, some prompts might cause the model to call tools excessively. (177748926)
- Fixed: `@Generable` on an `enum` produces a deprecation warning about `GenerationError` that cannot be silenced. (177899620)
- Fixed: Truncating transcript history in the `onPrompt` modifier might cause an unexpected runtime error. (177901494)
- Fixed: `onPrompt` might not be called when applied to a `Profile` without instructions. (177902488)
- Fixed: `PrivateCloudComputeLanguageModel` always uses greedy decoding. (178181782)

<a id="Game-Center"></a>

### Game Center

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: When you trigger the Access Point, its completion handler is never invoked. (172683368)

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: Modifications to the game controller lightbar (`GCController.light`) may persist after your application no longer has focus. (163514369) (FB20846101)
- Fixed: `+[GCController supportsHIDDevice:]` might return an incorrect result when queried with a recently connected HID device. (176985783) (FB22770585)

<a id="Gaming"></a>

### Gaming

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- A new command line tool lets you enable support for legacy Intel-based games during beta releases. To enable it, run the following command in Terminal: `sudo game-test-tool enable`. Restart your Mac computer for the change to take effect. Once enabled, games run transparently through the new underlying system behavior. Note that enabling legacy game support disables Rosetta, non-game processes might crash or behave unexpectedly, and this feature is intended only for playing legacy Intel-based games and is not available outside of macOS beta releases. (166398727)

<a id="Gatekeeper"></a>

### Gatekeeper

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- The spctl command line tool now supports a –purge command which will clean up Gatekeeper database entries for apps and executables which are no longer mounted. (123097648) (FB13625586)

<a id="Gaussian-Splats"></a>

### Gaussian Splats

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: When 3DGS content rendered by a GaussianSplatComponent is moved offscreen and then returns to the visible area, some splats might be missing or truncated. Camera or asset movement can restore rendering. (183538823)

<a id="Hardware-Security"></a>

### Hardware Security

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- arm64e.x1 introduces additional hardware security and performance instructions, including CPA2 for stronger MIE protection. Devices with support for arm64e.x1 include iPhone models with A20 Pro or later chips, Mac computers with M6 or later chips, and Apple Watch models with S11 or later chips. You can access arm64e.x1 and CPA2 in Xcode through the enhanced security pane and a build setting. Learn more in the [Enhanced Security article](https://docs.devpubs.apple.com/drafts/f16-dspector-161940504-rapid-isa-adoption-documentation/documentation/xcode/enabling-enhanced-security-for-your-app). (152103975)

<a id="HomeKit"></a>

### HomeKit

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- When Apple Intelligence in the Home app is enabled, your HomeKit Secure Video recordings are processed on-device and through Private Cloud Compute for video descriptions and search. (178858470)
- Apple Intelligence for Home requires an iCloud+ subscription starting at 2TB. (181282161)

<a id="Image-Playground"></a>

### Image Playground

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: When you try to generate an image using ChatGPT in the Messages extension on macOS, the image fails to generate. (174413381)
- Fixed: In the Image Playground photo picker, the All and Suggested tabs are missing, which might limit the number of photos available for you to choose from. (178256174)

<a id="Install-macOS-Golden-Gate"></a>

### Install macOS Golden Gate

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

<a id="Mac-Catalyst"></a>

### Mac Catalyst

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- Catalyst apps now behave like AppKit apps when you switch to them with no open windows - they won’t automatically create new windows unless activated through Dock or Spotlight. (69906818)

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: Mac-Idiom Catalyst apps could not use `UIStepper`. (57819435)
- Fixed: For some apps, the show/hide sidebar toolbar buttons are missing. (176879915)

<a id="Metal"></a>

### Metal

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: When you use a sampler to read from a texture with clamp-to-edge addressing mode, the result might be clamped to zero. (172520325)
- Fixed: On devices in the Apple 10 GPU family, using a sampler to read from a texture with clamp-to-edge addressing mode might produce results that are clamped to zero. (177318505)

<a id="Music"></a>

### Music

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: Music Visualizer shows a black screen in both full screen and window mode. (177480780)

<a id="Network-Security"></a>

### Network Security

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- Starting in 27.0 operating systems, select system processes now enforce stricter network security (TLS) requirements. These new requirements might cause connections to fail if the server does not meet them. The affected processes are those involved in MDM, DDM, Automated Device Enrollment, configuration profile installation, app installation, and software updates. Servers must support TLS 1.2 at minimum, using cipher suites and certificates that meet App Transport Security (ATS) requirements.

  For additional details on affected processes, requirements, and how to audit and diagnose failures in managed environments, please reference [Prepare your network environment for stricter security requirements](https://support.apple.com/en-us/126655). For additional details on ATS and the new requirements, please reference [Preventing Insecure Network Connections](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Security/preventing-insecure-network-connections) and [NSRequiresNIAPTLSPackageVersion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/BundleResources/Information-Property-List/NSRequiresNIAPTLSPackageVersion).

### NSApplication

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- `NSApplication.presentationOptions` now includes the `.disableScreenCornerInteractions` option, which you can use to disable Hot Corners. (168692527)

<a id="NSGestureRecognizer"></a>

### NSGestureRecognizer

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- A new `cancellableByScrollGesture` property on `NSGestureRecognizer` allows gesture recognizers to be automatically cancelled when the enclosing scroll view is panned. (165650612)
- Only the initial hit-tested view hierarchy will activate gesture recognizers until all gestures terminate. A new `exclusiveGestureBehavior` property on `NSView` allows you to opt-out of this exclusive behavior on a per-view-hierarchy basis. Further, the `Info.plist` key `NSViewGestureRecognizerIsExclusive` allows you to opt-out for the entire app. Additionally, a new `Info.plist` key `NSGestureRecognizerSuppressesMainMenuActions` allows main menu actions to be invoked while gesture recognizers are active. (173551081)
- To prevent exclusive gestures from making apps unresponsive, stuck gestures are automatically cancelled after user input has ended for a few seconds. A new user default, `NSCrashOnStuckGestureTimeout`, allows you to crash your app when this condition occurs, to aid in debugging. (175705302)
- A new diagnostic user default `NSGestureRecognizerCrashOnMissingOverrides` is provided to help developers find `NSGestureRecognizer` subclasses that are missing required overrides to ensure that they always reach a terminal state. Even without this gesture set, AppKit will produce error messages in the console to alert developers when such cases are found. (176396492)

<a id="Rosetta"></a>

### Rosetta

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- On launch, Applications previously set to “Open using Rosetta” by a user will have the application launch natively.

  Any compatibility issues requiring Rosetta from the past should be re-assessed on macOS 27. (168097174)

<a id="Deprecations"></a>

#### Deprecations

- If Rosetta was previously installed, it is not automatically restored after upgrading to macOS 27.0. (163213094)
- Installer packages which specify no `hostArchitecture` will now default to arm64. Ensure any pre and post install scripts behave as intended under arm64. Additionally, audit any remaining installer plugins to ensure compatibility on Apple silicon. (171187112)
- Intel-based plugins and loaders may not appear in Settings or trigger notifications of their incompatibility. All Intel-based software will no longer be compatible with macOS 28.0, excluding legacy games.

  Check common plugin locations for VSTs, HAL, ARA, PDEs, Color Pickers, Quicklook & Spotlight plugins/extensions/components, such as: ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/\* ~/Library/Printers/ ~/Library/ColorPickers/ (176042635)

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- If an app intent uses Duration or `LPLinkMetadata`, creating a shortcut with that intent and then attempting to edit it with “Describe a change” might fail. (166068090)

  **Workaround:** If the model discards the action, press “Undo” to recover the unsupported intent.
- When an app intent defines a `UnionValue` parameter with two number-related types (for example, both Int and Double), the number option appears twice in the parameter picker menu and shows as double-selected. (168315587)

  **Workaround:** Define only one number-related type in the `UnionValue` parameter (for example, use only Int or only Double, not both).

- Fixed: When location data is unavailable or only coarse-accuracy location data is available, Maps searches initiated through Siri might return empty or imprecise results. (175380461)
- Fixed: When you turn off Siri, some photo-related questions might return web search results instead of prompting you to share the photo with ChatGPT. (175884006)
- Fixed: When you ask Siri to work with reminder lists, you might need to use the exact list name. Siri might not recognize similar or partial list names. (176400964)
- Fixed: App Intents with `@UnionValue` types that accept a `PlaceDescriptorEntity` and a `String` always receive `String` values instead of `PlaceDescriptorEntity` entities. (176844035)
- Fixed: Starting a call with Siri might fail with an error in apps that adopt CallKit and the `phone.startCall` AppSchema. (177190637)
- Fixed: When you ask Siri to send a message to a contact that doesn’t exist on your device, Siri might draft a message to an unrelated contact. (177356158)
- Fixed: You might not see names and images of email senders in the Siri email list UI. (177416168)
- Fixed: Siri might not resolve some entity types when your app has provided only an `EntityStringQuery` for the entity type. (177464215)
- Fixed: Siri functionality during software updates is limited, including calls to emergency services. (177476889)

- Fixed: When you use ChatGPT with Apple Intelligence, some responses used in follow-up queries or when you resume a chat might be logged by Apple. (177755742)
- Fixed: When you ask Siri to find, search, or read reminders, Siri might list or read the reminders instead of showing a snippet. When reminder lists are displayed, the list color might not appear correctly. (177762533)
- Fixed: Siri might run the incorrect `OpenIntent` or `system.open` intent when multiple intents targeting different entity types are available in your app. (177992979)
- Fixed: When you tap the Send button in the Siri message confirmation flow, the message might fail to send. (178025056)
- Fixed: When asking Siri to call, message, or email a contact, Siri might fail to resolve the correct person — particularly when multiple contacts share the same name, when group names contain emoji or special characters, or when relationship labels (e.g., “my brother”) are ambiguous. In some cases, Siri might pick the wrong contact, fail to present a disambiguation prompt, or freeze during the disambiguation UI. (178379209)
- Fixed: Businesses with overnight hours might display as “Closed till \[next day\]” even during open hours. (178384054)
- Fixed: Siri might not respond to your voice correctly. (178489724)

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- After Siri returns photo search results and you select photos, Siri might not detect which photos are selected on screen. Commands like “Send these” might apply to all photos returned from the search rather than only the selected ones. (171728298)

  **Workaround:** Open Photos, select the photos you want to act on, then perform the action using Siri — for example, “Send these photos to Bob”.
- “Ask Siri” might appear in context menus on macOS even when Siri is disabled in System Settings or the system is in a region that does not currently support Siri. (176299524)
- Siri doesn’t support voice commands to interact with specific photos. For example, you can’t refer to photos by number, such as “photo one” or “photo four.” (176812955)

  **Workaround:** Use the photo picker to select the photo you want, or tap to select photos directly.
- When you ask Siri for Maps information, the response snippets might appear incomplete or display formatting issues. (177116121)

  **Workaround:** Ask Siri to repeat the information, or open Maps directly for complete details.
- When you ask Siri to add photos to an album, the confirmation prompt and spoken response might report or display more photos than will actually be added. (177376984)

  **Workaround:** Add photos to the album manually in the Photos app: tap Select, tap the photos you want to add, tap the Share button, tap Add to Album, then tap the album.
- Non-SF Symbol custom images for entities might not appear in Siri results for third-party apps. (177984074)

<a id="StoreKit"></a>

### StoreKit

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- Offer code redemption APIs now return a `VerificationResult` when redemption completes. If a redemption succeeds, your app receives a `VerificationResult` that contains a `Transaction` object. If a redemption fails, your app receives an error that describes what caused the redemption to fail. (141012819)
- StoreKit now includes the `Transaction.OwnershipType.assigned` and `Transaction.RevocationType.assignmentRevoked` enum values to support volume purchases. `Transaction` query methods now additionally return transactions assigned to the Managed Apple Account. (156749517)
- New `Product.ProductType` APIs represent subscription Bundles and subscription Suites. New APIs in `Product.SubscriptionInfo.BundledSubscription` let you fetch merchandising data about subscriptions contained in a Bundle. Transaction and RenewalInfo contain new fields that provide information about purchases and customer status regarding Bundles and Suites. (160501742)
- `partnerName` and `partnerId` properties for Advanced Commerce API are available in [Transaction.AdvancedCommerceInfo](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/transaction/advancedcommerceinfo-swift.struct) and [RenewalInfo.AdvancedCommerceInfo](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/product/subscriptioninfo/renewalinfo/advancedcommerceinfo-swift.struct).

<a id="Swift-Charts"></a>

### Swift Charts

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: When your project has a minimum deployment target lower than 27.0, using conditionals inside a `Chart` closure produces the warning “Conformance of `_ConditionalContent<TrueContent, FalseContent>` to `ChartContent` is only available in ‘’ 27.0 or newer,” and the app might crash at runtime when that content is loaded. (174168981)

<a id="SwiftData"></a>

### SwiftData

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: You might experience a deadlock for @Query when saving a ModelContext on a background actor while scheduling new async tasks for a ModelActor. (178113288)

<a id="SwiftUI"></a>

### SwiftUI

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- Bordered `Menu` and `Picker` buttons now support better label customization and no longer use `NSPopUpButton` in their implementation. (68559433) (FB8657381)
- `AsyncImage` now automatically caches downloaded images using HTTP caching protocols, allowing servers to control caching behavior via standard headers. You can customize caching for specific images using the new `AsyncImage` initializers that accept `URLRequest` with custom `cachePolicy` settings. Additionally, you can set a custom `URLSession` using the new `View.asyncImageURLSession(_:)` API to control how all child `AsyncImage` views perform data tasks. (78212597)
- A `@State` declared with an expression as its initial value used to evaluate the expression each time the view struct re-instantiates. In the case of `@State private var model = Model()`, this means `Model.init()` gets called many times throughout the view’s lifetime. Xcode 27 introduces a new `@State` implementation that avoids this repeated evaluation. This new behavior back-deploys to iOS 17 aligned OSes. The new `@State` is implemented with a Swift macro. It is largely source compatible with the property wrapper version, with a few exceptions.

  If you provide an initial value at `@State` declaration, and also try to assign a value to it in an initializer, the initializer value is discarded. This behavior has not changed because of the macro, but some such cases no longer compile:

  ```
   struct StickerPageView: View {
       @State private var page = StickerPage()
       let title: String
   
       init(title: String) {
           // `title` won't have any effect
           // this also won't compile with @State macro
           self.page = StickerPage(title: title)
           self.title = title
       }
   }
  ```

  When assigning initial value via an initializer, do not provide an initial value at the @State declaration.

  ```
   struct StickerPageView: View {
       @State private var page: StickerPage // no initial value expression
       let title: String
   
       init(title: String) {
           self.page = StickerPage(title: title) // works!
           self.title = title
       }
   }
  ```

  When all stored members of a struct are private, the compiler synthesizes a private init that can be used in an extension of the same type:

  ```
   struct StickerPageView: View {
       @State private var page: StickerPage
       private let title: String
       ...
   }
   
   extension StickerPageView {
       init(title: String, _ page: StickerPage) {
           self.init(page: page, title: title) // using the synthesized init
       }
   }
  ```

  The state macro disables this synthesized initializer. So the code above no longer compiles. To mitigate, assign value to members explicitly:

  ```
   extension StickerPageView {
       init(title: String, _ page: StickerPage) {
           self.title = title
           self.page = page
       }
   }
  ```

  In rare situations, the automatic inference of generic arguments of `@State` is less flexible with the macro implementation. Write the type with more specificity.

  Composing `@State` with other property wrappers or macros is not supported. (105893279)
- In apps built with the iOS 27.0 and macOS 27.0 SDKs, selectable `Text` views now support `TextRenderer`. (158160386) (FB19589465)
- In apps built with the 27.0 SDKs, the new `ReadableDocument` and `WritableDocument` protocols support asynchronous reading and writing, progress reporting, and direct access to document URLs. New `DocumentGroup` initializers that adopt these protocols let you disable document creation for editing-only apps and present custom UI before any document is opened. The initializers expose an `Observable` `URLDocumentConfiguration` and integrate with Swift concurrency and the `Observation` framework. New applications should prefer `ReadableDocument` and `WritableDocument` over `ReferenceFileDocument`, which remains available. (158441552)
- The menu bar on iPadOS 27.0 and macOS 27.0, as well as context menus on macOS 27.0, present a reduced set of menu item images. By default, SwiftUI now hides all menu item symbol images in most contexts, while non-symbol images remain visible. Review the updated Human Interface Guidelines to determine which menu items in your app should still display images. Use the `labelStyle(_:)` view modifier with the `.titleAndIcon` style to indicate that a menu item `Label`’s icon should always be shown — such as when the menu item represents an object or a concept rather than an action. SwiftUI continues to automatically provide default visible menu item images for certain common system-wide menu items, such as Settings, Share, and Print. (170480710)
- In apps built with the latest SDKs, the appearance of `TabViews` in inspectors now matches their appearance in sidebars, and in both contexts automatically uses the new `.tabs` picker style. (170678002)
- Disabled Toggles using the `.checkbox` style are no longer tinted in macOS, so you can more easily distinguish them from their enabled state. (172689844)
- The `TabsPickerStyle` style is now available for pickers that represent tab-based navigation and content selection. This style is similar to the `.segmented` style, but VoiceOver reads it as “tabs,” and on macOS it has a distinct visual appearance that distinguishes it from pickers that represent value selection — for example, a text alignment picker in an inspector. (173211711)
- You can now use the `TextInputBorderShape` type to customize the border shape of text input controls like `TextField` with the `textInputBorderShape(_:)` view modifier. The `.squareBorder` and `.roundedBorder` text field styles are soft deprecated — use the new `.bordered` text field style instead. (173362083)
- On macOS, the `Slider` implementation no longer uses `NSSlider`. (173990195)
- In apps built with the 27.0 SDKs, a `LabeledContent` view used inside a `Menu` maps its value to the platform menu item’s subtitle. (175594929)
- The @Entry macro now warns of potential issues if you store default class instances or closures in the environment. The SwiftUI Specialist skill in Xcode provides guidance for resolving these issues. (175902616)
- You can now access `concentricCornerRadii` and `concentricCornerRadii(in:)` on `GeometryProxy`. These APIs return the corner radii that are concentric with the view’s container shape as a `RectangleCornerRadii?`. You can use these values to drive custom drawing or layout that responds to the container’s corners without rendering a `ConcentricRectangle` directly. (177185166)
- You can now use the `Document` protocol for representing documents in `DocumentGroup`. This protocol combines `ReadableDocument` and `WritableDocument` for common read-and-write cases. Use `Document` instead of `ReferenceFileDocument` and `FileDocument`, which are now deprecated. (177458781)
- `@ContentBuilder` type checking performance is further improved for valid code compared to Beta 1. (177526032)
- The new data item or error object based `alert` and `confirmationDialog` modifiers can now be used by projects targeting iOS 15.0, macOS 12.0, tvOS 15.0, watchOS 8.0, and visionOS 1.0. (179388848)
- In macOS apps built with the macOS 27 SDK, the action retrieved from the `\.newDocument` environment value accepts an in-memory `ReadableDocument` produced by an autoclosure. SwiftUI presents a new document window populated with the supplied instance, instead of invoking the document group’s default factory. Use this to implement “New from Template” commands and similar flows. (180300890)
- A new `fileExporter(isPresented:documents:contentTypes:onCompletion:onCancellation:)` modifier exports a collection of values that conform to `WritableDocument` whose `Writer.Destination` is `URL`. The system presents a single export dialog, writes each document to the chosen destination, and reports the resulting URLs through `onCompletion`. (180301165)
- The `makeFileWrapper` closure of `FileWrapperDocumentWriter` now receives a second argument, `previous: FileWrapper?`, holding the `FileWrapper` from the document’s most recent read or write when one is available. Package documents can mutate `previous` in place and return it so that `FileWrapper` only writes children whose contents changed, avoiding rewriting an entire package on every save. Documents stored as a single file can ignore the second argument and return a fresh `FileWrapper` as before. Existing call sites must update their closures to accept the new parameter. (180301399)
- `DocumentReader.Source` and `DocumentWriter.Destination` now default to `URL`. Conforming types that read from or write to a file URL no longer need to declare `typealias Source = URL` or `typealias Destination = URL`. (180301692)

#### Resolved Issues

- In apps built with the macOS 27.0 SDK, `TextField` respects custom font and color styling applied to its prompt. Apply styling to the `Text` provided to `TextField`’s `prompt` parameter at initialization. (86580365)
- Fixed: A custom `TextRenderer` applied via `.textRenderer(_:)` now takes effect on a `Text` view that also has `.textSelection(.enabled)` applied. Previously, the custom renderer was dropped on selectable text, falling back to default rendering. (151015350)
- Fixed: When you apply both `.fileExporter(_:...)` and `.fileMover(_:...)` modifiers to a view, some dialogs might not present correctly. (154080867)
- Fixed: Section backgrounds in the `.grouped` form style don’t display a border when the “Show borders” accessibility setting is turned on. (155906280)
- Fixed: In macOS, buttons using the `.glass` and `.glassProminent` styles don’t display a hover state when used outside of a toolbar. (158800693)
- Fixed: In apps built with the 27.0 SDKs, `containerRelativeFrame(_:alignment:)` incorrectly accounts for safe-area insets on a `ScrollView`’s non-scrollable axis, causing the calculated scrollable content size to be too small. For example, a view using `containerRelativeFrame(.vertical)` inside a horizontal `ScrollView` extends into vertical safe-area regions, such as the navigation bar and home indicator, because only the scrollable axis insets are applied. (165913417)
- Fixed: Certain control-related view modifiers unexpectedly affect sheet and popover content. In apps built with the 27.0 SDKs, the `controlSize`, `buttonSizing`, `buttonRepeatBehavior`, `menuIndicatorVisibility`, and `ButtonBorderShape` environment values are now reset to their default values in sheets and popovers. (167448274)
- Fixed: Dual-axis scroll views align to `.center` instead of the `.topLeading` unit point, which disagrees with documentation. Additionally, specifying `.defaultScrollAnchor(_:)` on dual-axis scroll views results in incorrect placement. (171755081)
- Fixed: On macOS, a Menu composed with a `.plain` or custom button style uses the AXDescription (Label) attribute instead of the AXTitle attribute. (171831601)
- Fixed: Buttons with `keyboardShortcut(.defaultAction)` remain tinted when disabled. (174278196)
- In macOS apps built with the macOS 27 SDK, `List` accepts drops in two cases that previously didn’t work: drags with compatible transfer representations are accepted into reorderable content even when the `.reorderableItem` transfer type isn’t present, and a `.dropDestination(...)` modifier declared on a list item now performs the drop. These behaviors match the existing iOS `List` behavior. (174628712)
- Fixed: The “Settings…” menu item does not display an icon. (175053352)
- Fixed: An app might crash if a submenu within the toolbar overflow menu is an `NSHostingMenu` and a user tries to open the overflow menu. (177616606)
- Fixed: In some system video players, when you attempt to drag a `Slider` within a window that is configured to be movable by dragging its background, the window might be dragged instead of the slider. (177790490)
- Fixed: Buttons with `keyboardShortcut(.defaultAction)` and a `.destructive` role don’t appear as a destructive button in sheet toolbars. (178957869)
- Fixed: `@State` variable named using a raw identifier fails to compile. (179149051) (FB23015259)
- The `read(from:progress:)` and `write(content:to:previous:progress:)` requirements of `DocumentReader` and `DocumentWriter` are declared with `@concurrent` instead of `nonisolated`. With approachable-concurrency defaults that infer `MainActor` isolation, an unannotated `nonisolated` async method runs on the main actor, defeating the intent of off-main reading and writing. Conforming types that previously used `nonisolated` should switch to `@concurrent` to match. (180302015)
- The `makeDocument:` and `makeReadableDocument:` closures passed to `DocumentGroup` initializers are now `@MainActor`-isolated. SwiftUI invokes these factories on the main actor when constructing a document instance, allowing the closure body to access main-actor state — including the supplied `URLDocumentConfiguration` — without hopping isolation domains. (180302065)
- `URLDocumentConfiguration` is a `@MainActor`-isolated `@Observable` reference type and no longer conforms to `Sendable`. Code that captured a configuration in a `Sendable` closure or stored it in a `Sendable` value should drop the constraint and access the configuration on the main actor. (180302075)

<a id="Known-Issues"></a>

#### Known Issues

- Progress reported in `DocumentReader.read(from:progress:)` and `DocumentWriter.write(snapshot:to:previous:progress:)` might not be presented. (158441261)

<a id="Deprecations"></a>

#### Deprecations

- The `FileDocument` protocol is deprecated. Use `ReadableDocument` for read-only documents or `Document` for documents that support reading and writing. (178776840)

<a id="System"></a>

### System

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- System now provides Swift APIs for the C `stat`, `lstat`, `fstat`, and `fstatat` system calls. This includes a new `Stat` type with initializers from `FilePath`, `FileDescriptor`, or a C string; `FilePath.stat()` and `FileDescriptor.stat()` instance methods; and supporting types (`FileType`, `FileMode`, `FileFlags`, `UserID`, `GroupID`, `DeviceID`, and `Inode`). See [SYS-0006](https://github.com/apple/swift-system/blob/main/Proposals/0006-system-stat.md) for more details. (160612181)

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: Custom `FilePath` or `FileDescriptor` extensions that make unqualified calls to `stat()` or `stat(_)` (without the `Darwin.` qualification) might conflict with the new Swift `stat()` instance methods introduced in [SYS-0006](https://github.com/apple/swift-system/blob/main/Proposals/0006-system-stat.md), causing build errors. See [SYS-0008](https://github.com/apple/swift-system/blob/main/Proposals/0008-backdeploy-cinterop-stat.md) for more details. (177911316)

<a id="System-Integrity-Protection"></a>

### System Integrity Protection

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- Accessing files in other developer teams’ app data containers and app group containers no longer prompts the user for authorization; such accesses are denied by default and can be managed by the user in Privacy & Security settings. (161835690)
- XProtect may now restrict access to app data that is commonly targeted by malicious software.  Accessing files created by other developer teams’ apps may be denied by default but may be managed by the user in Privacy & Security settings. (178668601)

<a id="TCC"></a>

<a id="Thunderbolt"></a>

### Thunderbolt

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: When connecting to two identical displays (same model and serial number), the first display will work as expected whereas the second display might not light up. (176292156)

<a id="UIKit"></a>

### UIKit

<a id="New-Features"></a>

#### New Features

- When linked on iOS 27, tvOS 27, macCatalyst 27, or visionOS 27 SDKs, you can use `UIScene.extendStateRestoration` and `UIScene.completeStateRestoration` to extend state restoration for `UIScene.ActivationState.background` to `UIScene.ActivationState.foreground` lifecycle transitions. (161843040)
- On iOS 27.0 and iPadOS 27.0, Siri can load resources from drag interactions installed in your app’s interface. For example, when Apple Intelligence is invoked from a context menu, the system calls `UIDragInteractionDelegate` methods to load the content. Because drag sessions might begin without a user-initiated drag gesture, avoid performing animations or presenting modal UI for the drag in `dragInteraction(_:sessionWillBegin:)`. Instead, perform those actions in `dragInteraction(_:sessionDidMove:)`. (168884200)
- On iPadOS 27.0 and macOS 27.0, the menu bar and context menus present a reduced set of menu item images and do not display images set on menu elements by default. You can use the new `preferredImageVisibility` property on `UIMenuElement` — including updated initializers on `UIMenu`, `UIAction`, `UICommand`, and `UIKeyCommand` — to customize the visibility of each element’s image in these menus. Review the updated Human Interface Guidelines to determine which menu elements in your app should display images. UIKit automatically provides default visible menu element images for certain common system-wide menu items, such as Settings, Share, and Print. (170479084)

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: The `UISceneClosureConfirmation` API does not present a confirmation dialog. (170008344)
- Fixed: The `UIMenuLeaf` protocol is missing the subtitle property introduced in iOS 16.0. (173271862)
- Fixed: Catalyst views that have both `UIDragInteraction` and `UIContextMenuInteraction` do not allow you to activate both interactions with touch. (175048540)

<a id="Deprecations"></a>

#### Deprecations

- Apps built with the latest SDK must adopt the scene-based life cycle or they fail to launch. For migration guidance, see [Transitioning to the UIKit scene-based life cycle](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/transitioning-to-the-uikit-scene-based-life-cycle). (141837548)

<a id="VideoToolbox"></a>

### VideoToolbox

<a id="New-Features"></a>

- `VTLowLatencyFrameInterpolationConfiguration` now supports arbitrary source dimensions up to 1080p. (179040806)

<a id="Virtualization"></a>

### Virtualization

<a id="Resolved-Issues"></a>

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed: Saving a virtual machine state with one or more USB devices passed through to a virtual machine may fail. (174267926)
- Fixed: If an App uses `AccessoryAccess` framework within a Virtualization framework to launch a virtual machine, and if you assign both the Apple Keyboard (A1242 or A1243) and Apple Mouse (A1152) to that app and subsequently un-assign the mouse, then the virtual machine might crash. (174794802)
- Fixed: A virtual machine might crash during restore if a USB mass storage device was hot-plugged before the virtual machine was saved but is not attached during the restore. (177528319)
- Fixed: `AAUSBAccessoryManager registerListener:withMatchingCriteria:completionHandler:` does not work with a non-empty matching criteria array. (177662539)
