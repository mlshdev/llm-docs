#### Known Issues

- macOS apps might crash with an exception related to duplicate toolbar items. This often happens when either (A) `NavigationSplitView`s are nested or (B) toolbars with `id`s are specified (`View.toolbar(id:...)`) and a new window is created with the same identified toolbar.  (134589426)

  **Workaround:** (A) Use apply `.toolbar(removing: .sidebarToggle)` within the sidebar column of the inner `NavigationSplitView`.
