## Discussion

If this property is [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true), text fields are forced to give up their responder status before [shouldUnselect](shouldunselect.md) is called on the preference pane. If it is [false](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false), the preference pane is responsible for forcing text fields to give up their responder status before saving them. The default value is [true](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true).
