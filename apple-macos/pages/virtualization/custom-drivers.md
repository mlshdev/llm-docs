# Custom Virtio drivers

**Interface languages:** Swift, Objective-C

**Framework:** Virtualization  
**Kind:** API Collection

Create custom Virtio drivers for Linux virtual machines.

## Topics

### Creating and configuring Virtio drivers

- [VZCustomVirtioDevice](vzcustomvirtiodevice.md): An interface that represents a custom Virtio device that you provide the implementation for.
- [VZCustomVirtioDeviceConfiguration](vzcustomvirtiodeviceconfiguration.md): An object that defines a custom Virtio Device configuration.
- [VZVirtioDeviceSpecificConfiguration](vzvirtiodevicespecificconfiguration.md): The device-specific configuration for a Virtio device

### Responding to Virtio driver events

- [VZCustomVirtioDeviceDelegateProvider](vzcustomvirtiodevicedelegateprovider.md): A custom Virtio Device provider for devices that implement a custom Virtio device configuration delegate.
- [VZCustomVirtioDeviceProvider](vzcustomvirtiodeviceprovider.md): A base class that describes the provider of a custom Virtio device.

### Working with VirtQueues

- [VZVirtioQueue](vzvirtioqueue.md): A Virtio queue.
- [VZVirtioQueueElement](vzvirtioqueueelement.md): A unit of work on a Virtio queue, also known as a descriptor chain.

### Specifying driver features

- [VZVirtioFeatureSet](vzvirtiofeatureset.md): Values that represent a set of Virtio feature bits.
- [VZNegotiatedVirtioFeatureSet](vznegotiatedvirtiofeatureset.md): Values that represent a set of negotiated Virtio feature bits.

### Managing shared memory

- [VZVirtioSharedMemoryRegion](vzvirtiosharedmemoryregion.md): A class that represents a Virtio shared memory region for a custom Virtio device in a virtual machine.
- [VZVirtioSharedMemoryRegionConfiguration](vzvirtiosharedmemoryregionconfiguration.md): The configuration of a Virtio shared memory region.

### Responding to Virtio events

- [VZCustomVirtioDeviceConfigurationDelegate](vzcustomvirtiodeviceconfigurationdelegate.md): A class that conforms to the custom Virtio device configuration delegate protocol that can provide methods for tracking the state of a custom Virtio device configuration object.
- [VZCustomVirtioDeviceDelegate](vzcustomvirtiodevicedelegate.md): A delegate protocol that defines the methods you implement to respond to the life cycle events of a custom Virtio device.
