# Storage

**Interface languages:** Swift, Objective-C

**Framework:** Virtualization  
**Kind:** API Collection

Configure the block-storage devices that represent the disks of the guest system.

## Topics

### Configurations

- [VZVirtioBlockDeviceConfiguration](vzvirtioblockdeviceconfiguration.md): The configuration object that requests the creation of a virtual storage device in the guest system.
- [VZStorageDeviceConfiguration](vzstoragedeviceconfiguration.md): The common configuration traits for storage device requests.
- [VZUSBMassStorageDeviceConfiguration](vzusbmassstoragedeviceconfiguration.md): The configuration object that represents a USB Mass storage device.
- [VZDiskImageCachingMode](vzdiskimagecachingmode.md): An integer that describes the disk image caching mode.
- [VZDiskImageSynchronizationMode](vzdiskimagesynchronizationmode.md): An integer that describes the disk image synchronization mode.
- [VZNVMExpressControllerDeviceConfiguration](vznvmexpresscontrollerdeviceconfiguration.md): The configuration object that represents an NVM Express Controller storage device.

### Devices

- [VZStorageDevice](vzstoragedevice.md): A class that represents a storage device in a VM.

### Attachment points

- [VZDiskBlockDeviceStorageDeviceAttachment](vzdiskblockdevicestoragedeviceattachment.md): A storage device attachment that uses a disk to store data.
- [VZDiskImageStorageDeviceAttachment](vzdiskimagestoragedeviceattachment.md): A device that stores content in a disk image.
- [VZNetworkBlockDeviceStorageDeviceAttachment](vznetworkblockdevicestoragedeviceattachment.md): A storage device attachment backed by a Network Block Device (NBD) client.
