# VZVirtioFileSystemDeviceConfiguration (Swift)

**Framework:** Virtualization  
**Kind:** Class  
**Availability:** macOS 12.0+

An object that represents the configuration of a Virtio file system device.

## Declaration

```swift
class VZVirtioFileSystemDeviceConfiguration
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Use `VZVirtioFileSystemDeviceConfiguration` to create a Virtio file system device which allows the host to expose directories to a guest using a [tag](vzvirtiofilesystemdeviceconfiguration/tag.md) label.

The example below shows the creation of a `VZVirtioFileSystemDeviceConfiguration` that shares a single directory that the user can manually mount after creating a mount point in the guest VM:

**Swift**

```swift
// Define a URL to a specific file path, in this case the 
// "Projects" directory in the user's home directory.
let projectsURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: NSHomeDirectory() + "Projects")

static func createSingleDirectoryShareDeviceConfiguration() -> VZVirtioFileSystemDeviceConfiguration {
    let sharedDirectory = VZSharedDirectory(url: projectsURL, readOnly: false)
    let singleDirectoryShare = VZSingleDirectoryShare(directory: sharedDirectory)

    // Create the VZVirtioFileSystemDeviceConfiguration and assign it a unique tag. 
    let sharingConfiguration = VZVirtioFileSystemDeviceConfiguration(tag: "Projects")
    sharingConfiguration.share = singleDirectoryShare

    return sharingConfiguration
}
```

**Objective-C**

```objc
    // Define a URL to a specific file path, in this case the
    // "Projects" directory in the user's home directory.
    NSString *projectsPath = [NSHomeDirectory() stringByAppendingPathComponent:@"Projects"];
    NSURL *projectsURL = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:projectsPath];

    VZSharedDirectory *sharedDirectory = [[VZSharedDirectory alloc] initWithURL:projectsURL readOnly:NO];
    VZSingleDirectoryShare *singleDirectoryShare = [[VZSingleDirectoryShare alloc] initWithDirectory:sharedDirectory];

    // Create the VZVirtioFileSystemDeviceConfiguration and assign it a unique tag.
    VZVirtioFileSystemDeviceConfiguration *sharingConfiguration = [[VZVirtioFileSystemDeviceConfiguration alloc] initWithTag:@"Projects"];
    sharingConfiguration.share = singleDirectoryShare;
```

A `VZVirtioFileSystemDeviceConfiguration` can also share multiple directories. The example below demonstrates sharing the `~/Invoices` and `~/Projects` directories from the user’s home directory to the guest VM:

**Swift**

```swift
// Define URLs at specific file paths, in this case the 
// "Projects" and "Invoices" directories in the user's home directory.
let projectsURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: NSHomeDirectory() + "Projects")
let invoicesURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: NSHomeDirectory() + "Invoices")

static func createMultipleDirectoryShareDeviceConfiguration() -> VZVirtioFileSystemDeviceConfiguration {
    let sharedProjectsDirectory = VZSharedDirectory(url: projectsURL, readOnly: false)

    // It's also possible to share directories that are read-only: 
    let sharedInvoicesDirectory = VZSharedDirectory(url: invoicesURL, readOnly: true)

    // Associate each shared directory with a name, which is how the framework lists them under the mount point.
    let directoriesToShare = ["My Projects": sharedProjectsDirectory, "Invoices": sharedInvoicesDirectory]
    let multipleDirectoryShare = VZMultipleDirectoryShare(directories: directoriesToShare)

    // Create the VZVirtioFileSystemDeviceConfiguration and assign it a unique tag. 
    let sharingConfiguration = VZVirtioFileSystemDeviceConfiguration(tag: "myfiles")
    sharingConfiguration.share = multipleDirectoryShare

    return sharingConfiguration
}
```

**Objective-C**

```objc
    // Define URLs at specific file paths, in this case the    
    // "Projects" and "Invoices" directories in the user's home directory.
    NSString *projectsPath = [NSHomeDirectory() stringByAppendingPathComponent:@"Projects"];
    NSString *invoicesPath = [NSHomeDirectory() stringByAppendingPathComponent:@"Invoices"];
    NSURL *projectsURL = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:projectsPath];
    NSURL *invoicesURL = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:invoicesPath];

    VZSharedDirectory *sharedProjectsDirectory = [[VZSharedDirectory alloc] initWithURL:projectsURL readOnly:NO];

    // It's also possible to share directories that are read-only:
    VZSharedDirectory *sharedInvoicesDirectory = [[VZSharedDirectory alloc] initWithURL:invoicesURL readOnly:YES];

    // Associate each shared directory with a name, which is how the framework lists them under the mount point.
    VZMultipleDirectoryShare *multipleDirectoryShare = [[VZMultipleDirectoryShare alloc] initWithDirectories:@{
        @"My Projects": sharedProjectsDirectory,
        @"Invoices": sharedInvoicesDirectory,
    }];

    // Create the VZVirtioFileSystemDeviceConfiguration and assign it a unique tag.
    VZVirtioFileSystemDeviceConfiguration *sharingConfiguration = [[VZVirtioFileSystemDeviceConfiguration alloc] initWithTag:@"myfiles"];
    sharingConfiguration.share = multipleDirectoryShare;
```

### Mounting shared directories

> **Important**

>  The commands required to mount shared directories in a guest VM aren’t commands that your app can execute or that you can script from inside your application to a VM; the user must perform them either interactively or as part of a script while logged in to the guest. You must communicate these requirements to the user of your app.

Mounting a shared directory requires the user to execute a command in a terminal window, the specific mount command depends on the guest VM’s operating system:

- In macOS guests, use `mount_virtiofs tag directory`.
- In Linux guests, use `mount -t virtiofs tag directory`.

The `tag` argument is the file system device configuration label — `Projects` in the single directory case and `myfiles` in the multiple directory case in these examples — and `directory` is the mount point in the guest file system to which the framework attaches the shared directories.

<a id="Automounting-shared-directories-in-macOS-VMs"></a>

### Automounting shared directories in macOS VMs

In macOS 13 and later, it’s possible to specify a file system device that macOS 13 or later guest VMs automount using the [macOSGuestAutomountTag](vzvirtiofilesystemdeviceconfiguration/macosguestautomounttag.md) property. The example below demonstrates sharing a single macOS directory, to a macOS guest:

```swift
// Define a URL to a specific file path, in this case the 
// "Projects" directory in the user's home directory.
let projectsURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: NSHomeDirectory() + "Projects")

static func createAutomountSingleDirectoryShareDeviceConfiguration() -> VZVirtioFileSystemDeviceConfiguration {
    let sharedDirectory = VZSharedDirectory(url: projectsURL, readOnly: false)
    let singleDirectoryShare = VZSingleDirectoryShare(directory: sharedDirectory)

    // Assign the automount tag to this share. macOS shares automounted directories automatically under /Volumes in the guest.  
    let sharingConfiguration = VZVirtioFileSystemDeviceConfiguration(tag: VZVirtioFileSystemDeviceConfiguration.macOSGuestAutomountTag)
    sharingConfiguration.share = singleDirectoryShare

    return sharingConfiguration
}
```

The macOS guest automounts the user’s `~/Projects` directory from the host and shares it under `/Volumes/My Shared Files/` in the macOS guest.

It’s also possible to automount multiple directories in macOS guests. The example below demonstrates sharing the `~/Invoices` and `~/Projects` directories from the user’s home directory to the macOS guest VM:

```swift
// Define URLs at specific file paths, in this case the 
// "Projects" and "Invoices" directories in the user's home directory.
let projectsURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: NSHomeDirectory() + "Projects")
let invoicesURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: NSHomeDirectory() + "Invoices")

static func createAutomountMultipleDirectoryShareDeviceConfiguration() -> VZVirtioFileSystemDeviceConfiguration {
    // Share the contents of ~/Projects, which is writeable.
    let sharedProjectsDirectory = VZSharedDirectory(url: projectsURL, readOnly: false)

    // Share the contents of ~/Invoices, but make it read only.
    let sharedInvoicesDirectory = VZSharedDirectory(url: invoicesURL, readOnly: true) 

    // Associate each shared directory with a name, which is how the framework lists them under the mount point in the guest.
    let directoriesToShare = ["My Projects": sharedProjectsDirectory, "Invoices": sharedInvoicesDirectory]
    let multipleDirectoryShare = VZMultipleDirectoryShare(directories: directoriesToShare)

    // Assign the automount tag to this share. macOS will automatically mount each shared directory at /Volumes/My Shared Files.
    let sharingConfiguration = VZVirtioFileSystemDeviceConfiguration(tag: VZVirtioFileSystemDeviceConfiguration.macOSGuestAutomountTag)
    sharingConfiguration.share = multipleDirectoryShare

    return sharingConfiguration
}
```

In the guest, the framework lists each shared directory by its specified name under `/Volumes/My Shared Files`. Here, the shared directories in the macOS guest are `/Volumes/My Shared Files/My Projects` and `/Volumes/My Shared Files/Invoices`.
