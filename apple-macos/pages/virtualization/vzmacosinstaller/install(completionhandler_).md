# install(completionHandler:)

**Framework:** Virtualization  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** macOS 12.0+

Start installing macOS.

## Declaration

```swift
@preconcurrency func install(completionHandler: @escaping @Sendable (Result<Void, any Error>) -> Void)
```

## Parameters

- `completionHandler`: A block the framework calls after installation has completed successfully or has failed.

  The `error` parameter passed to the block is `nil` if installation was successful. The framework invokes the block on the VM’s queue. The completion handler returns an `error` parameter that describes the reason for the failure; the `error` is `nil` if installation was successful.

## Discussion

This method starts the installation process. The VM must be in a stopped state. During the installation operation, pausing or stopping the VM results in an undefined behavior.

If you start the installation on the same [VZMacOSInstaller](../vzmacosinstaller.md) object more than once, the framework raises an exception.

Call this method only on the VM’s queue.
