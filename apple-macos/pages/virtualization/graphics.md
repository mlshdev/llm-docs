# Graphics (Swift)

**Framework:** Virtualization  
**Kind:** API Collection

Configure a device for a guest to display its UI.

## Overview

A graphics device that allows people to see and interact with the UI of a VM, you use this device to attach a display that’s shown in a [VZVirtualMachineView](vzvirtualmachineview.md).

## Topics

### Configurations

- [VZGraphicsDisplayConfiguration](vzgraphicsdisplayconfiguration.md): The base class for a graphics display configuration.
- [VZMacGraphicsDeviceConfiguration](vzmacgraphicsdeviceconfiguration.md): Configuration for a display attached to a Mac graphics device.
- [VZMacGraphicsDisplayConfiguration](vzmacgraphicsdisplayconfiguration.md): The configuration for a Mac graphics device.
- [VZGraphicsDeviceConfiguration](vzgraphicsdeviceconfiguration.md): The base class for a graphics device configuration.
- [VZVirtioGraphicsDeviceConfiguration](vzvirtiographicsdeviceconfiguration.md): Configuration that represents the configuration of a Virtio graphics device for a Linux VM.

### Devices

- [VZGraphicsDevice](vzgraphicsdevice.md): A class that represents a graphics device in a VM.
- [VZGraphicsDisplay](vzgraphicsdisplay.md): A class that represents a graphics display in a VM.
- [VZMacGraphicsDevice](vzmacgraphicsdevice.md): An object that represents a Mac graphics device.
- [VZVirtioGraphicsScanout](vzvirtiographicsscanout.md): A Virtio graphics scanout that corresponds to a Virtio graphics scanout configuration.
- [VZMacGraphicsDisplay](vzmacgraphicsdisplay.md): An object that represents the graphics display on a Mac.
- [VZVirtioGraphicsDevice](vzvirtiographicsdevice.md): A Virtio graphics device.
- [VZVirtualMachineViewAdaptor](vzvirtualmachineviewadaptor.md): A sendable wrapper that connects a virtual machine view to a virtual machine.
