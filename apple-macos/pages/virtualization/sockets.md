# Sockets

**Interface languages:** Swift, Objective-C

**Framework:** Virtualization  
**Kind:** API Collection

Configure a device that manages port-based communication with the guest system.

## Topics

### Configurations

- [VZVirtioSocketDeviceConfiguration](vzvirtiosocketdeviceconfiguration.md): A configuration object that requests the creation of a socket device to communicate with the guest system.
- [VZSocketDeviceConfiguration](vzsocketdeviceconfiguration.md): The common configuration traits for socket device requests.

### Devices

- [VZVirtioSocketDevice](vzvirtiosocketdevice.md): A device that manages port-based connections between the guest system and the host computer.
- [VZSocketDevice](vzsocketdevice.md): The common behavior of socket devices.

### Connection management

- [VZVirtioSocketListener](vzvirtiosocketlistener.md): An object that listens for port-based connection requests from the guest operating system.
- [VZVirtioSocketConnection](vzvirtiosocketconnection.md): A port-based connection between the guest operating system and the host computer.
