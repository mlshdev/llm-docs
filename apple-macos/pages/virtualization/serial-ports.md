# Serial ports

**Interface languages:** Swift, Objective-C

**Framework:** Virtualization  
**Kind:** API Collection

Configure the serial devices that you use to communicate with the guest system.

## Topics

### Configurations

- [VZVirtioConsoleDeviceSerialPortConfiguration](vzvirtioconsoledeviceserialportconfiguration.md): A configuration object that requests the creation of a console device to communicate with the guest system.
- [VZSerialPortConfiguration](vzserialportconfiguration.md): The common configuration traits for serial port requests.

### Attachment points

- [VZFileHandleSerialPortAttachment](vzfilehandleserialportattachment.md): An attachment point that allows bidirectional communication using file handles.
- [VZFileSerialPortAttachment](vzfileserialportattachment.md): An attachment point that writes data from the guest system to a file.
- [VZSerialPortAttachment](vzserialportattachment.md): The common behaviors for the serial attachment points of your virtual machine.
