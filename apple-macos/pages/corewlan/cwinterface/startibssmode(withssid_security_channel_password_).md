## Discussion

If *name* is *nil*, the machine name will be used as the network name. This operation may require an administrator password.

> **Handling Errors in Swift**

>  In Swift, this method returns `Void` and is marked with the `throws` keyword to indicate that it throws an error in cases of failure.
>
> You call this method in a `try` expression and handle any errors in the `catch` clauses of a `do` statement, as described in [Error Handling](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/ErrorHandling.html) in [The Swift Programming Language](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/) and `About Imported Cocoa Error Parameters`.
