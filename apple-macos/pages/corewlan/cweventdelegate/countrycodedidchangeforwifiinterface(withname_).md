## Discussion

Register for country code change notifications by sending the [startMonitoringEvent(with:)](../cwwificlient/startmonitoringevent%28with_%29.md) message to a Wi-Fi client object with the [CWEventType.countryCodeDidChange](../cweventtype/countrycodedidchange.md) event type.

Use the Wi-Fi interface’s [countryCode()](../cwinterface/countrycode%28%29.md) method to query the currently adopted country code.
