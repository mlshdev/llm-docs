## Discussion

Register for SSID change notifications by sending the [startMonitoringEvent(with:)](../cwwificlient/startmonitoringevent%28with_%29.md) message to a Wi-Fi client object with the [CWEventType.ssidDidChange](../cweventtype/ssiddidchange.md) event type.

Use the Wi-Fi interface’s [ssidData()](../cwinterface/ssiddata%28%29.md) or [ssid()](../cwinterface/ssid%28%29.md) method to query the current SSID.
