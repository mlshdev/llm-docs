# setDelegate(\_:withConfiguration:) (Swift)

**Framework:** IOBluetooth  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** macOS

Allows an object to register itself as client of the L2CAP channel.

## Declaration

```swift
func setDelegate(_ channelDelegate: Any!, withConfiguration channelConfiguration: [AnyHashable : Any]!) -> IOReturn
```

## Parameters

- `channelDelegate`: The object that will play the role of channel delegate.
- `channelConfiguration`: The dictionary that describes the initial configuration for the channel.

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

Returns kIOReturnSuccess if the delegate is successfully registered.

<a id="Discussion"></a>

## Discussion

A channel delegate is the object the L2CAP channel uses as target for data and events. The developer will implement only the the methods he/she is interested in. A list of the possible methods is at the end of this file in the definition of the informal protocol IOBluetoothL2CAPChannelDelegate. A newly opened L2CAP channel will not complete its configuration process until the client that opened it registers a connectionHandler. This prevents that case where incoming data is received before the client is ready.

NOTE: This method is only available in macOS 10.5 (Bluetooth v2.0) or later.
