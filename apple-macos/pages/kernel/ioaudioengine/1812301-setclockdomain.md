# setClockDomain

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** Kernel

Sets a property that CoreAudio uses to determine how devices are synchronized. If an audio device can tell that it is synchronized to another engine, it should set this value to that engine's clock domain. If an audio device can be a primary clock, it may publish its own clock domain for other devices to use.

## Declaration

```objectivec
virtual void setClockDomain(
 UInt32 clockDomain = clockDomain); 
```

## Parameters

- `clockDomain`: is the unique ID of another engine that this engine realizes it is synchronized to, use the default value kIOAudioNewClockDomain to have IOAudioEngine create a unique clock domain.
