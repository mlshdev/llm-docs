# messageClients

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** Kernel

Sends a generic message to all attached clients.

## Declaration

```objectivec
virtual IOReturn messageClients(
 UInt32 type, 
 void *argument = 0,
 vm_size_t argSize = 0 ); 
```

## Parameters

- `type`: A type defined in `IOMessage.h` or defined by the provider family.
- `argument`: An argument defined by the provider family, not used by IOService.
- `argSize`: Specifies the size of argument, in bytes. If argSize is non-zero, argument is treated as a pointer to argSize bytes of data. If argSize is 0 (the default), argument is treated as an ordinal and passed by value.

## Return Value

Any non-`kIOReturnSuccess` return codes returned by the clients, or `kIOReturnSuccess` if all return `kIOReturnSuccess`.

## Overview

A provider may deliver messages via the message method to its clients informing them of state changes, such as `kIOMessageServiceIsTerminated` or `kIOMessageServiceIsSuspended`. Certain messages are defined by the I/O Kit in `IOMessage.h` while others may be family dependent. This method may be called in the provider to send a message to all the attached clients, via the messageClient method.
