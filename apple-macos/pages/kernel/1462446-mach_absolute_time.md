# mach_absolute_time

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** Kernel  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** macOS 10.0+

Returns current value of a clock that increments monotonically in tick units (starting at an arbitrary point), this clock does not increment while the system is asleep.

## Declaration

```objectivec
uint64_t mach_absolute_time(void);
```

<a id="return_value"></a>

## Return Value

		Value of mach absolute time clock.

<a id="discussion"></a>

## Discussion

Prefer to use the equivalent clock_gettime_nsec_np(CLOCK_UPTIME_RAW) in nanoseconds.

> This API has the potential of being misused to access device signals to try to identify the device or user, also known as fingerprinting. Regardless of whether a user gives your app permission to track, fingerprinting is not allowed. When you use this API in your app or third-party SDK (an SDK not provided by Apple), declare your usage and the reason for using the API in your app or third-party SDK’s `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` file.
