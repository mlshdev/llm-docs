# AVCCommandInGeneration

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** Kernel

Sends an AVC command to the device and stores the response. The command must complete in the specified FireWire bus generation otherwise kIOFireWireBusReset is returned.

## Declaration

```objectivec
virtual IOReturn AVCCommandInGeneration(
 UInt32generation, 
 const UInt8 *command,
 UInt32cmdLen,
 UInt8 *response,
 UInt32 *responseLen); 
```

## Parameters

- `generation`: The bus generation that the command must execute in.
- `command`: Pointer to command to send.
- `cmdLen`: Length of the command.
- `response`: Pointer to place to store the response.
- `responseLen`: Pointer to response length - initialize to the size of the buffer pointed to by response, updated to the number of bytes returned by the device.
