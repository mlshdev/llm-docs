# USB

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** Kernel  
**Kind:** API Collection

Implement a driver that supports Universal Serial Bus (USB) devices.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Use kernel extensions to implement support for devices with real-time requirements, such as audio and video devices. 

> **Important**

> For most types of USB drivers, Apple has deprecated the use of kernel extensions. Instead, create a DriverKit extension using [USBDriverKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usbdriverkit).

This framework refers to the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF) *Universal Serial Bus 3.2 Specification*, Revision 1.0, September 22, 2017. You can view this specification and other referenced USB specifications at [http://www.usb.org/](http://www.usb.org/).
