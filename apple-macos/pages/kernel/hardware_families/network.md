# Network

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** Kernel  
**Kind:** API Collection

Implement a driver that interacts with network interfaces such as Ethernet adaptors.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

For most types of network interfaces, the use of kernel extensions is deprecated. Instead, create a DriverKit extension using [NetworkingDriverKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/networkingdriverkit).

## Topics

### Interfaces

- [IONetworkInterface](../ionetworkinterface.md): Abstract class that manages the connection between an IONetworkController and the data link interface layer.
- [IONetworkController](../ionetworkcontroller.md): Implements the framework for a generic network controller.

### Network Data

- [IONetworkData](../ionetworkdata.md): An object that manages a fixed-size named buffer.
- [IONetworkMedium](../ionetworkmedium.md): An object that encapsulates information about a network medium (i.e. 10Base-T, or 100Base-T Full Duplex).
- [IOPacketQueue](../iopacketqueue.md): Implements a bounded FIFO queue of mbuf packets.
- [IOPacketBufferConstraints](../iopacketbufferconstraints.md)
