# getObject

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** Kernel

Returns the object stored under a given key.

## Declaration

```objectivec
virtual OSObject * getObject(
 const char *aKey) const; 
```

## Parameters

- `aKey`: A C string key identifying the object to be returned to caller.

<a id="return_value"></a>

## Return Value

The object stored under `aKey`, or `NULL` if the key does not exist in the dictionary.

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

The returned object will be released if removed from the dictionary; if you plan to store the reference, you should call retain on that object.
