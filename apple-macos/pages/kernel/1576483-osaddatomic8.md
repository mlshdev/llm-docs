# OSAddAtomic8

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** Kernel  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** macOS 10.0+

8-bit add operation, performed atomically with respect to all devices that participate in the coherency architecture of the platform.

## Declaration

```objectivec
SInt8 OSAddAtomic8(SInt32 amount, volatile SInt8 *address);
```

## Parameters

- `amount`: The amount to add.
- `address`: The address of the value to update atomically.

## Discussion

The OSAddAtomic8 function adds the specified amount to the value at the specified address and returns the original value.

This function guarantees atomicity only with main system memory. It is specifically unsuitable for use on noncacheable memory such as that in devices; this function cannot guarantee atomicity, for example, on memory mapped from a PCI device. Previous incarnations of this function incorporated a memory barrier on systems with weakly-ordered memory architectures, but current versions contain no barriers.
