# OSIterator

**Interface language:** Objective-C

## Declaration

```objectivec
class OSIterator : OSObject
```

## Overview

OSIterator is the abstract superclass for all Libkern C++ object iterators. It defines the basic interface for iterating and resetting. See OSCollection and OSCollectionIterator for more information.

With very few exceptions in the I/O Kit, all Libkern-based C++ classes, functions, and macros are **unsafe** to use in a primary interrupt context. Consult the I/O Kit documentation related to primary interrupts for more information.

OSIterator provides no concurrency protection.

## Topics

### Miscellaneous

- [getNextObject](ositerator/1808048-getnextobject.md): Advances to and returns the next object in the iteration.
- [isValid](ositerator/1808063-isvalid.md): Check that the collection hasn't been modified during iteration.
- [reset](ositerator/1808074-reset.md): Resets the iterator to the beginning of the collection, as if it had just been created.
