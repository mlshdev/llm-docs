## Discussion

Allocates and initializes a read/write lock in general purpose memory. Read/write locks provide for multiple readers, one exclusive writer, and are supplied by libkern/locks.h. This function may block and so should not be called from interrupt level or while a spin lock is held. IORWLocks use the global IOKit lock group, IOLockGroup. To simplify kext debugging and lock-heat analysis, consider using lck\_\* locks with a per-driver lock group, as defined in kern/locks.h.
