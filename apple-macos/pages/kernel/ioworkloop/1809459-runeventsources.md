# runEventSources

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** Kernel

## Declaration

```objectivec
virtual bool runEventSources(); 
```

## Return Value

Return false if the work loop is shutting down, true otherwise.

## Overview

Consists of the inner 2 loops of the threadMain function(qv). The outer loop terminates when there is no more work, and the inside loop walks the event list calling the checkForWork method in each event source. If an event source has more work to do, it can set the more flag and the outer loop will repeat.

This function can be used to clear a priority inversion between the normal workloop thread and multimedia's real time threads. The problem is that the interrupt action routine is often held off by high priority threads. So if they want to get their data now they will have to call us and ask if any data is available. The multi-media user client will arrange for this function to be called, which causes any pending interrupts to be processed and the completion routines called. By the time the function returns all outstanding work will have been completed at the real time threads priority.
