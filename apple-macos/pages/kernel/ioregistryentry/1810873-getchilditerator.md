# getChildIterator

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** Kernel

Returns an iterator over an registry entry's child entries in a plane.

## Declaration

```objectivec
virtual OSIterator * getChildIterator(
 const IORegistryPlane *plane ) const; 
```

## Parameters

- `plane`: The plane object.

<a id="return_value"></a>

## Return Value

Returns an iterator over the children of the entry, or zero if there is a resource failure. The iterator must be released when the iteration is finished. All objects returned by the iteration are retained while the iterator is valid, though they may no longer be attached during the iteration.

## Overview

This method creates an iterator which will return each of a registry entry's child entries in a specified plane.
