# OSObject

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** Kernel  
**Kind:** Class  
**Availability:** macOS 10.0+

OSObject is the concrete root class of the Libkern and I/O Kit C++ class hierarchy.

## Declaration

```objectivec
class OSObject : OSMetaClassBase
```

## Overview

OSObject defines the minimal functionality required of Libkern and I/O Kit C++ classes: tie-in to the run-time type information facility, the dynamic allocation/initialization paradigm, and reference counting. While kernel extensions are free to use their own C++ classes internally, any interaction they have with Libkern or the I/O Kit will require classes ultimately derived from OSObject.

**Run-Time Type Information**

OSObject is derived from the abstract root class OSMetaClassBase, which declares (and defines many of) the primitives on which the run-time type information facility is based. A parallel inheritance hierarchy of metaclass objects provides run-time introspection, including access to class names, inheritance, and safe type-casting. See OSMetaClass for more information.

**Dynamic Allocation/Initialization**

The kernel-resident C++ runtime does not support exceptions, so Libkern classes cannot use standard C++ object constructors and destructors, which use exceptions to report errors. To support error-handling during instance creation, then, OSObject separates object allocation from initialization. You can create a new OSObject-derived instance with the `new` operator, but this does nothing more than allocate memory and initialize the reference count to 1. Following this, you must call a designated initialization function and check its `bool` return value. If the initialization fails, you must immediately call release on the instance and handle the failure in whatever way is appropriate. Many Libkern and I/O Kit classes define static instance-creation functions (beginning with the word "with") to make construction a one-step process for clients.

**Reference Counting**

OSObject provides reference counting services using the retain, release(), release(int freeWhen) and free functions. The public interface to the reference counting is retain, and release; release(int freeWhen) is provided for objects that have internal retain cycles.

In general, a subclass is expected to only override free. It may also choose to override release(int freeWhen) if the object has a circular retain count, as noted above.

**Use Restrictions**

With very few exceptions in the I/O Kit, all Libkern-based C++ classes, functions, and macros are **unsafe** to use in a primary interrupt context. Consult the I/O Kit documentation related to primary interrupts for more information.

**Concurrency Protection**

The basic features of OSObject are thread-safe. Most Libkern subclasses are not, and require locking or other protection if instances are shared between threads. I/O Kit driver objects are either designed for use within thread-safe contexts or designed to inherently be thread-safe. Always check the individual class documentation to see what steps are necessary for concurrent use of instances.
