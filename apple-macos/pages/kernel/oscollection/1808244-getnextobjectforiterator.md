# getNextObjectForIterator

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** Kernel

Returns the next member of a collection.

## Declaration

```objectivec
virtual bool getNextObjectForIterator( 
 void *iterationContext, 
 OSObject **nextObject) const = 0; 
```

## Parameters

- `iterationContext`: The iteration context.
- `nextObject`: The object returned by reference to the caller.

## Return Value

`true` if an object was found, `false` otherwise.

## Overview

This pure virtual member function, which subclasses must implement, is called by an OSCollectionIterator to get the next object for a given iteration context. The collection object should interpret `iterationContext` appropriately, advance the context from its current object to the next object (if it exists), return that object by reference in `nextObject`, and return `true` for the function call. If there is no next object, the collection object must return `false`.

For associative collections, the object returned should be the key used to access its associated value, and not the value itself.
