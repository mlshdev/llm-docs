### Base Types

- [IOSCSIPeripheralDeviceNub](ioscsiperipheraldevicenub.md)
- [IOSCSIPrimaryCommandsDevice](ioscsiprimarycommandsdevice.md)
- [IOSCSIProtocolServices](ioscsiprotocolservices.md): This class defines the public SCSI Protocol Services Layer API for any class that implements SCSI protocol services. A protocol services layer driver is responsible for taking incoming SCSITaskIdentifier objects and translating them to the native command type for the native protocol interface (e.g. SBP-2 ORB on FireWire).
- [IOSCSIProtocolInterface](ioscsiprotocolinterface.md): This class defines the public SCSI Protocol Layer API for any class that provides Protocol services or needs to provide the Protocol Service API for passing service requests to a Protocol Service driver.
