# kChecksumTCPNoPseudoHeader

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** Kernel

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

A TCP checksum that covers the TCP header and the TCP data, but the pseudo header is not included in the checksum computation. A partial 16-bit checksum value must be provided to allow the protocol stacks to calculate and verify the final checksum. This type of checksum is not currently supported on the output path.
