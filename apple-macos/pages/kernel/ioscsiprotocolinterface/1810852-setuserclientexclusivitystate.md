# SetUserClientExclusivityState

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** Kernel

Sets the current exclusivity state of the user client.

## Declaration

```objectivec
virtual IOReturn SetUserClientExclusivityState (
 IOService *userClient,
 boolstate ); 
```

## Parameters

- `userClient`: The instance of SCSITaskUserClient for which to change exclusivity state.
- `state`: Exclusivity state. `true` means exclusive access is desired, `false` means exclusive access is being released.

## Overview

The SetUserClientExclusivityState() method is called by the SCSITaskUserClient to set the exclusive access mode.

- [GetCommandGate](1810184-getcommandgate.md): Accessor method to obtain the IOCommandGate.
- [GetInitialPowerState](1810205-getinitialpowerstate.md): This method is called to obtain the initial power state of the device (usually the highest).
- [GetUserClientExclusivityState](1810233-getuserclientexclusivitystate.md): Gets the current exclusivity state of the user client.
- [HandleCheckPowerState()](1810265-handlecheckpowerstate.md): The HandleCheckPowerState (void) method is on the serialized side of the command gate and can change member variables safely without multi-threading issues. It's main purpose is to call the superclass' HandleCheckPowerState ( UInt32 maxPowerState ) with the max power state the class registered with.
- [HandleCheckPowerState(UInt32)](1810294-handlecheckpowerstate.md): The HandleCheckPowerState(UInt32 maxPowerState) method is called by the subclasses and is passed the maxPowerState number given to the power manager at initialization time. This guarantees the threads block until that power state has been achieved.
- [HandleCheckPowerState(void)](1810368-handlecheckpowerstate.md): The HandleCheckPowerState (void) method is on the serialized side of the command gate and can change member variables safely without multi-threading issues. It's main purpose is to call the superclass' HandleCheckPowerState ( UInt32 maxPowerState ) with the max power state the class registered with.
- [HandleGetUserClientExclusivityState](1810391-handlegetuserclientexclusivityst.md): Gets the current exclusivity state of the user client.
- [HandlePowerChange](1810424-handlepowerchange.md): The HandlePowerChange method is pure virtual and is left to each protocol or application layer driver to implement. It is guaranteed to be called on its own thread of execution and can make synchronous or asynchronous calls.
- [HandleProtocolServiceFeature](1810462-handleprotocolservicefeature.md): This method is called to enact support of a protocol specific service feature.
- [HandleSetPowerState](1810510-handlesetpowerstate.md): The HandleSetPowerState method is called by the glue code and is on the serialized side of the command gate.
- [HandleSetUserClientExclusivityState](1810570-handlesetuserclientexclusivityst.md): Sets the current exclusivity state of the user client.

- [LogicalUnitReset](1810795-logicalunitreset.md): Resets the specified Logical Unit.
- [setPowerState](1810826-setpowerstate.md): Requests a power managed driver to change the power state of its device.
- [sGetPowerTransistionInProgress](1810884-sgetpowertransistioninprogress.md): The sGetPowerTransistionInProgress method is a static function used as C-\>C++ glue for going behind the command gate.
- [sGetUserClientExclusivityState](1810914-sgetuserclientexclusivitystate.md): The sGetUserClientExclusivityState method is a static function used as C-\>C++ glue for going behind the command gate.
- [sHandleCheckPowerState](1810945-shandlecheckpowerstate.md): The sHandleCheckPowerState method is a static function used as C-\>C++ glue for going behind the command gate.
- [sHandleSetPowerState](1810965-shandlesetpowerstate.md): The sHandleSetPowerState method is a static function used as C-\>C++ glue for going behind the command gate.
- [sPowerManagement](1810988-spowermanagement.md): The sPowerManagement method is a static C-function which is called using mach's thread_call API. It guarantees us a thread of execution which is different than the power management thread and the workloop thread on which we can issue commands to the device synchronously or asynchronously without worrying about deadlocks. It calls through to HandlePowerChange, which is a state machine used to direct power management.
- [sSetUserClientExclusivityState](1811011-ssetuserclientexclusivitystate.md): The sSetUserClientExclusivityState method is a static function used as C-\>C++ glue for going behind the command gate.

- [TicklePowerManager()](1811095-ticklepowermanager.md): The TicklePowerManager(void) method is called by CheckPowerState and sends an activity tickle to the power manager so that the idle timer is reset.
- [TicklePowerManager(UInt32)](1811118-ticklepowermanager.md): The TicklePowerManager(UInt32 maxPowerState) method is a convenience function which can be called by subclasses in TicklePowerManager (void) in order to tell the power manager to reset idle timer or bring the device into the requested state. It returns whatever is returned by activityTickle (true if device is in the requested state, false if it is not).
- [TicklePowerManager(void)](1811187-ticklepowermanager.md): The TicklePowerManager(void) method is called by CheckPowerState and sends an activity tickle to the power manager so that the idle timer is reset.
- [willTerminate](1811210-willterminate.md): Passes a termination up the stack.
