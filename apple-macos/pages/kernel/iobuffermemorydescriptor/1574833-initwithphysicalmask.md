# initWithPhysicalMask

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** Kernel  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** macOS 10.11.4+

Creates a memory buffer with memory descriptor for that buffer.

## Declaration

```objectivec
virtual bool initWithPhysicalMask(task_t inTask, IOOptionBits options, mach_vm_size_t capacity, mach_vm_address_t alignment, mach_vm_address_t physicalMask);
```

## Parameters

- `inTask`: The task the buffer will be mapped in. Pass NULL to create memory unmapped in any task (eg. for use as a DMA buffer).
- `options`: Options for the allocation:

  kIODirectionOut, kIODirectionIn - set the direction of the I/O transfer.

  kIOMemoryPhysicallyContiguous - pass to request memory be physically contiguous. This option is heavily discouraged. The request may fail if memory is fragmented, may cause large amounts of paging activity, and may take a very long time to execute.

  kIOMemoryKernelUserShared - pass to request memory that will be mapped into both the kernel and client applications.

  kIOMapInhibitCache - allocate memory with inhibited cache setting.

  kIOMapWriteThruCache - allocate memory with writethru cache setting.

  kIOMapCopybackCache - allocate memory with copyback cache setting.

  kIOMapWriteCombineCache - allocate memory with writecombined cache setting.
- `capacity`: The number of bytes to allocate.
- `alignment`:
- `physicalMask`: The buffer will be allocated with pages such that physical addresses will only have bits set present in physicalMask. For example, pass 0x00000000FFFFFFFFULL for a buffer to be accessed by hardware that has 32 address bits.

## Return Value

Returns an instance of class IOBufferMemoryDescriptor to be released by the caller, which will free the memory desriptor and associated buffer.

## Discussion

Added in OS X 10.5, this method allocates a memory buffer with a given size and alignment in the task's address space specified, and returns a memory descriptor instance representing the memory. It is recommended that memory allocated for I/O or sharing via mapping be created via IOBufferMemoryDescriptor. Options passed with the request specify the kind of memory to be allocated - pageablity and sharing are specified with option bits. This function may block and so should not be called from interrupt level or while a simple lock is held.
