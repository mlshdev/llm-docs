# IOPacketQueue

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** Kernel  
**Kind:** Class  
**Availability:** macOS 10.0+

Implements a bounded FIFO queue of mbuf packets.

## Declaration

```objectivec
class IOPacketQueue : OSObject
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Packets are removed from the head of the queue (dequeue), and new packets are added to the tail of the queue (enqueue). A spinlock is used to synchronize access to the queue between methods that have a "lock" prefix.

## Topics

### Miscellaneous

- [dequeue](iopacketqueue/1810464-dequeue.md): Removes a single packet from the head of the queue.
- [dequeueAll](iopacketqueue/1810493-dequeueall.md): Removes all packets from the queue and returns the head of the packet chain.
- [enqueue(IOPacketQueue \*)](iopacketqueue/1810512-enqueue.md): Removes all packets from the specified queue, and adds them to the tail of this queue.

- [enqueueWithDrop](iopacketqueue/1810567-enqueuewithdrop.md): Adds a chain of packets to the tail of the queue.
- [flush](iopacketqueue/1810584-flush.md): Frees all packets currently held in the queue and releases them back to the free mbuf pool.

- [peek](iopacketqueue/1810837-peek.md): Examines the packet at the head of the queue without removing it from the queue.
- [prepend(IOPacketQueue \*)](iopacketqueue/1810853-prepend.md): Removes all packets from the specified queue, and adds them to the head of this queue.
