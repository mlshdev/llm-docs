# commandSleep(void \*, AbsoluteTime, UInt32)

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** Kernel

Put a thread that is currently holding the command gate to sleep.

## Declaration

```objectivec
virtual IOReturn commandSleep(
 void *event, 
 AbsoluteTimedeadline, 
 UInt32interruptible); 
```

## Parameters

- `event`: Pointer to an address.
- `deadline`: Clock deadline to timeout the sleep.
- `interruptible`: THREAD_UNINT, THREAD_INTERRUPTIBLE or THREAD_ABORTSAFE. THREAD_UNINT specifies that the sleep cannot be interrupted by a signal. THREAD_INTERRUPTIBLE specifies that the sleep may be interrupted by a "kill -9" signal. THREAD_ABORTSAFE specifies that the sleep may be interrupted by any user signal.

## Return Value

THREAD_AWAKENED - normal wakeup, THREAD_TIMED_OUT - timeout expired, THREAD_INTERRUPTED - interrupted, THREAD_RESTART - restart operation entirely, kIOReturnNotPermitted if the calling thread does not hold the command gate.

## Overview

Put a thread to sleep waiting for an event but release the gate first. If the event occurs or timeout occurs then the commandGate is closed before the function returns.
