# getWorkLoop

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** Kernel

Returns the IOWorkLoop for the driver

## Declaration

```objectivec
virtual IOWorkLoop *getWorkLoop() const; 
```

## Overview

The IOWorkLoop is used to synchronized all critical aspects of the driver. This includes all entry points to the driver as well as power management.

- [performPowerStateChange](1811791-performpowerstatechange.md): This function is called by the IOAudioDevice when a power state change is needed.

- [setDeviceCanBeDefault](1811833-setdevicecanbedefault.md): This function is to be called to tell CoreAudio if this device shouldn't be a default device.
- [setDeviceName](1811841-setdevicename.md): Sets the name of the device
- [setDeviceShortName](1811844-setdeviceshortname.md): Sets the short name of the device
- [setFamilyManagePower](1811848-setfamilymanagepower.md): Called set whether or not the family should manage the device power throught the IOService power management APIs.
- [setIdleAudioSleepTime](1811852-setidleaudiosleeptime.md): This function is to be called by a driver that doesn't want to be told about the audio going idle immediately, but at some point in the future.

- [start](1811891-start.md): This function is called automatically by the system to tell the driver to start vending services to the rest of the system.
- [stop](1811898-stop.md): This is responsible for stopping the device after the system is done with it (or if the device is removed from the system).
- [timerFired](1811908-timerfired.md): Internal static function called when the timer fires.
