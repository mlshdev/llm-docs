# setIdleAudioSleepTime

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** Kernel

This function is to be called by a driver that doesn't want to be told about the audio going idle immediately, but at some point in the future.

## Declaration

```objectivec
virtual void setIdleAudioSleepTime(
 unsigned long longsleepDelay); 
```

## Parameters

- `sleepDelay`: The amount of time, in nanoseconds, before the hardware should be told to go idle.

## Overview

This is useful if the device will want to power down its hardware into an idle sleep state, but doesn't want to do that unless audio hasn't been used for a while. Calling this function immediately changes the idle sleep timer and queues it up if the idle is different from the previous idle time. The idle time defaults to 0, which means be called immediately (backwards compatible with previous versions of IOAudioFamily). A value of 0xffffffffffffffffULL means don't ever tell the driver about going idle.
