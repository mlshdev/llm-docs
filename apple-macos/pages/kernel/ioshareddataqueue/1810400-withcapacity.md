# withCapacity

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** Kernel

Static method that creates a new IOSharedDataQueue instance with the capacity specified in the size parameter.

## Declaration

```objectivec
static IOSharedDataQueue *withCapacity(
 UInt32size); 
```

## Parameters

- `size`: The size of the data queue memory region.

## Return Value

Returns the newly allocated IOSharedDataQueue instance. Zero is returned on failure.

## Overview

The actual size of the entire data queue memory region (to be shared into a user process) is equal to the capacity plus the IODataQueueMemory overhead. This overhead value can be determined from the DATA_QUEUE_MEMORY_HEADER_SIZE macro in \<IOKit/IODataQueueShared.h\>. The size of the data queue memory region must include space for the overhead of each IODataQueueEntry. This entry overhead can be determined from the DATA_QUEUE_ENTRY_HEADER_SIZE macro in \<IOKit/IODataQueueShared.h\>.

This method allocates a new IODataQueue instance and then calls initWithCapacity() with the given size parameter. If the initWithCapacity() fails, the new instance is released and zero is returned.
