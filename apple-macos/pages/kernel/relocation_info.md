## Topics

### Instance Properties

- [r_address](relocation_info/1577793-r_address.md): In `MH_OBJECT` files, an offset from the start of the section to the item containing the address requiring relocation.
- [r_extern](relocation_info/1577784-r_extern.md): Indicates whether the `r_symbolnum` field is an index into the symbol table (1) or a section number (0).
- [r_length](relocation_info/1577791-r_length.md): Indicates the length of the item containing the address to be relocated.
- [r_pcrel](relocation_info/1577785-r_pcrel.md): Indicates whether the item containing the address to be relocated is part of a CPU instruction that uses PC-relative addressing.
- [r_symbolnum](relocation_info/1577798-r_symbolnum.md): Indicates either an index into the symbol table (when the `r_extern` field is set to 1) or a section number (when the `r_extern` field is set to 0). As previously mentioned, sections are ordered from 1 to 255 in the order in which they appear in the `LC_SEGMENT` load commands. This field is set to `R_ABS` for relocation entries for absolute symbols, which need no relocation.
- [r_type](relocation_info/1577790-r_type.md)
