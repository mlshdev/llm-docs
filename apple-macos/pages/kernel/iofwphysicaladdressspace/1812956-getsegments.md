# getSegments

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** Kernel

Returns the scatter gather list of memory segments from the IODMACommand used in this PhysicalAddressSpace.

## Declaration

```objectivec
inline IOReturn getSegments(
 UInt64 *offset,
 FWSegment *fw_segments,
 UInt32 *num_segments ) ;
```

## Parameters

- `offset`: input/output parameter, defines the starting and ending offset in the memory descriptor, relative to any offset passed to the prepare() method. FWSegment Points to an array of memory segments. num_segments Size of the FWSegment array.

## Return Value

returns kIOReturnSuccess on success
