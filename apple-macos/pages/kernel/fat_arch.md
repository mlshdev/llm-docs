# fat_arch

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** Kernel  
**Availability:** macOS 10.8+

Describes the location within the binary of an object file targeted at a single architecture. Declared in `/usr/include/mach-o/fat.h`.

## Declaration

```objectivec
struct fat_arch {
    ...
};
```

## Discussion

An array of `fat_arch` data structures appears directly after the [fat_header](fat_header.md) data structure of a binary that contains object files for multiple architectures.

Regardless of the content this data structure describes, all its fields are stored in big-endian byte order.

## Topics

### Fields

- [cpusubtype](fat_arch/1558623-cpusubtype.md): An enumeration value of type `cpu_subtype_t`. Specifies the specific member of the CPU family on which this entry may be used or a constant specifying all members.
- [offset](fat_arch/1558628-offset.md): Offset to the beginning of the data for this CPU.
- [size](fat_arch/1558631-size.md): Size of the data for this CPU.
- [align](fat_arch/1558625-align.md): The power of 2 alignment for the offset of the object file for the architecture specified in `cputype` within the binary. This is required to ensure that, if this binary is changed, the contents it retains are correctly aligned for virtual memory paging and other uses.

### Instance Properties

- [cputype](fat_arch/1558626-cputype.md)
