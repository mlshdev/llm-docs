class IONetworkData : OSObject
```

## Overview

An IONetworkData object manages a fixed-size named buffer. This object provides external access methods that can be used to access the contents of the data buffer. In addition, serialization is supported, and therefore this object can be added to a property table to publish the data object. An unique name must be assigned to the object during initialization. An OSSymbol key will be created based on the assigned name, and this key can be used when the object is added to a dictionary.

The level of access granted to the access methods can be restricted, by specifying a set of supported access types when the object is initialized, or modified later by calling setAccessTypes(). By default, each IONetworkData object created will support serialization, and will also allow its data buffer to be read through the read() access method.

An access notification handler, in the form of a 'C' function, can be registered to receive a call each time the data buffer is accessed through an access method. Arguments provided to the handler will identify the data object and the type of access that triggered the notification. The handler can therefore perform lazy update of the data buffer until an interested party tries to read or serialize the data. The notification handler can also take over the default action performed by the access methods when the buffer type is set to kIONetworkDataBufferTypeNone. This will prevent the access methods from accessing the data buffer, and allow the handler to override the access protocol.

This object is primarily used by IONetworkInterface to export interface properties to user space.
