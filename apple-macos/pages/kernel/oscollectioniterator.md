# OSCollectionIterator

**Interface language:** Objective-C

**Framework:** Kernel  
**Kind:** Class  
**Availability:** macOS 10.0+

## Declaration

```objectivec
class OSCollectionIterator : OSIterator
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

OSCollectionIterator defines a consistent mechanism to iterate through the objects of an OSCollection. It expands on the basic interface of OSIterator to allow association of an iterator with a specific collection.

To use an OSCollectionIterator, you create it with the collection to be iterated, then call OSIterator as long as it returns an object:

\<pre\> OSCollectionIterator \* iterator = OSCollectionIterator::withCollection(myCollection); OSObject \* object; while (object = iterator-\>getNextObject()) { // do something with object } // optional if (!iterator-\>isValid()) { // report that collection changed during iteration } iterator-\>release(); \</pre\>

Note that when iterating associative collections, the objects returned by `getNextObject` are keys; if you want to work with the associated values, simply look them up in the collection with the keys.

**Use Restrictions**

With very few exceptions in the I/O Kit, all Libkern-based C++ classes, functions, and macros are **unsafe** to use in a primary interrupt context. Consult the I/O Kit documentation related to primary interrupts for more information.

OSCollectionIterator provides no concurrency protection.
