## Discussion

If possible, use [process(\_:localization:)](process%28__localization_%29.md) and automatically apply optimizations to resources.

If your resources must remain untouched or must retain a specific folder structure, use the `copy` rule. It copies resources at the given `path`, as is, to the top level in the package’s resource bundle. If the given path represents a directory, Swift Package Manager preserves its structure.
