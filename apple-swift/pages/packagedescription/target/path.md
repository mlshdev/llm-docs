## Discussion

If the path is `nil`, Swift Package Manager looks for a target’s source files at predefined search paths and in a subdirectory with the target’s name.

The predefined search paths are the following directories under the package root:

- `Sources`, `Source`, `src`, and `srcs` for regular targets
- `Tests`, `Sources`, `Source`, `src`, and `srcs` for test targets

For example, Swift Package Manager looks for source files inside the `[PackageRoot]/Sources/[TargetName]` directory.

Don’t escape the package root; that is, values like `../Foo` or `/Foo` are invalid.
