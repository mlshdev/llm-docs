# systemLibrary(name:path:pkgConfig:providers:)

**Framework:** PackageDescription  
**Kind:** Type Method

Creates a system library target.

## Declaration

```swift

## Discussion

Use system library targets to adapt a library installed on the system to work with Swift packages. Such libraries are generally installed by system package managers (such as Homebrew and apt-get) and exposed to Swift packages by providing a `modulemap` file along with other metadata such as the library’s `pkgConfig` name.
