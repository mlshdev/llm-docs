## Discussion

Note that packages that use branch-based dependency requirements can’t be depended upon by packages that use version-based dependency requirements; you should remove branch-based dependency requirements before publishing a version of your package.

The following example defines a version requirement that accepts any change in the develop branch.

```swift
.branch(“develop”)
```
