## Discussion

Specifying exact version requirements are not recommended as they can cause conflicts in your dependency graph when multiple other packages depend on a package. As Swift packages follow the semantic versioning convention, think about specifying a version range instead.

The following example defines a version requirement that requires version 1.2.3 of a package.

```swift
.exact(“1.2.3”)
```
