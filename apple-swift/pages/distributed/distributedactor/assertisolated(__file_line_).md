## Discussion

This function’s effect varies depending on the build flag used:

- In playgrounds and `-Onone` builds (the default for Xcode’s Debug configuration), stops program execution in a debuggable state after printing `message`.
- In `-O` builds (the default for Xcode’s Release configuration), the isolation check is not performed and there are no effects.

> **Note**

> This check is performed against the actor’s serial executor, meaning that / if another actor uses the same serial executor–by using that actor’s serial executor as its own `Actor.unownedExecutor`–this check will succeed , as from a concurrency safety perspective, the serial executor guarantees mutual exclusion of those two actors.
