# remoteCallVoid(on:target:invocation:throwing:)

**Framework:** Distributed  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 18.0+ · iPadOS 18.0+ · Mac Catalyst 18.0+ · macOS 15.0+ · tvOS 18.0+ · visionOS 2.0+ · watchOS 11.0+

Invoked by the Swift runtime when making a remote call.

## Declaration

```

## Discussion

The `arguments` are the arguments container that was previously created by `makeInvocationEncoder` and has been populated with all arguments.

This method should perform the actual remote function call, and await for its response.

<a id="Errors"></a>

## Errors

This method is allowed to throw because of underlying transport or serialization errors, as well as by re-throwing the error received from the remote callee (if able to).
