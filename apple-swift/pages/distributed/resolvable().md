### Requirements

The attached to type must be a protocol that refines the `DistributedActor` protocol. It must either specify a concrete `ActorSystem` or constrain it in such way that the system’s `SerializationRequirement` is statically known.

### Distributed Actors

- [DistributedActor](distributedactor.md): Common protocol to which all distributed actors conform implicitly.
- [DistributedActorSystem](distributedactorsystem.md): A distributed actor system underpins and implements all functionality of distributed actors.
- [buildDefaultDistributedRemoteActorExecutor(\_:)](builddefaultdistributedremoteactorexecutor%28__%29.md): Obtain the unowned `SerialExecutor` that is used by by remote distributed actor references. The executor is shared between all remote default executor remote distributed actors, and it will crash if any job is enqueued on it.
