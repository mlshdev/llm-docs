# debugPrint(\_:separator:terminator:)

**Framework:** Swift  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ · iPadOS 8.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.10+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

Writes the textual representations of the given items most suitable for debugging into the standard output.

## Declaration

```swift
func debugPrint(_ items: Any..., separator: String = " ", terminator: String = "\n")
```

## Parameters

- `items`: Zero or more items to print.
- `separator`: A string to print between each item. The default is a single space (`" "`).
- `terminator`: The string to print after all items have been printed. The default is a newline (`"\n"`).

## Discussion

You can pass zero or more items to the `debugPrint(_:separator:terminator:)` function. The textual representation for each item is the same as that obtained by calling `String(reflecting: item)`. The following example prints the debugging representation of a string, a closed range of integers, and a group of floating-point values to standard output:

```swift
debugPrint("One two three four five")
// Prints "One two three four five"

debugPrint(1...5)
// Prints "ClosedRange(1...5)"

debugPrint(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0)
// Prints "1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0"
```

To print the items separated by something other than a space, pass a string as `separator`.

```swift
debugPrint(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, separator: " ... ")
// Prints "1.0 ... 2.0 ... 3.0 ... 4.0 ... 5.0"
```

The output from each call to `debugPrint(_:separator:terminator:)` includes a newline by default. To print the items without a trailing newline, pass an empty string as `terminator`.

```swift
for n in 1...5 {
    debugPrint(n, terminator: "")
}
// Prints "12345"
```
