## Discussion

This iterator calls `next(isolation:)` on its base iterator; if this call returns `nil`, `next(isolation:)` returns `nil`. Otherwise, `next(isolation:)` calls the transforming closure on the received element, takes the resulting asynchronous sequence, and creates an asynchronous iterator from it.  `next(isolation:)` then consumes values from this iterator until it terminates.  At this point, `next(isolation:)` is ready to receive the next value from the base sequence.
