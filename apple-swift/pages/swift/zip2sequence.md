# Zip2Sequence

**Framework:** Swift

**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ · iPadOS 8.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.10+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

A sequence of pairs built out of two underlying sequences.

## Declaration

```swift
@frozen struct Zip2Sequence<Sequence1, Sequence2> where Sequence1 : Sequence, Sequence2 : Sequence
```

## Overview

In a `Zip2Sequence` instance, the elements of the *i*th pair are the *i*th elements of each underlying sequence. To create a `Zip2Sequence` instance, use the `zip(_:_:)` function.

The following example uses the `zip(_:_:)` function to iterate over an array of strings and a countable range at the same time:

```swift
let words = ["one", "two", "three", "four"]
let numbers = 1...4

for (word, number) in zip(words, numbers) {
    print("\(word): \(number)")
}
// Prints "one: 1"
// Prints "two: 2"
// Prints "three: 3"
// Prints "four: 4"
```
