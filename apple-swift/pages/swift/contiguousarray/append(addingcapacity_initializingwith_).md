# append(addingCapacity:initializingWith:)

**Framework:** Swift  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 12.2+ · iPadOS 12.2+ · Mac Catalyst 12.2+ · macOS 10.14.4+ · tvOS 12.2+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 5.2+

Grows the array to have enough capacity for the specified number of elements, then calls the closure with an output span covering the array’s uninitialized memory.

## Declaration

```swift
mutating func append<E>(addingCapacity uninitializedCount: Int, initializingWith initializer: @_lifetime(span: copy span) (inout OutputSpan<Element>) throws(E) -> Void) throws(E) where E : Error
```

## Parameters

- `uninitializedCount`: The number of new elements the array should have space for.
- `initializer`: A closure that initializes new elements.

  - Parameters:

    - span: An `OutputSpan` covering uninitialized memory with space for the specified number of additional elements.

## Discussion

Inside the closure, initialize elements by appending to `span`. It ensures safety by keeping track of the initialization state of the memory At the end of the closure, `span`’s `count` elements will have been appended to the array.

If the closure throws an error, the items appended until that point will remain in the array.
