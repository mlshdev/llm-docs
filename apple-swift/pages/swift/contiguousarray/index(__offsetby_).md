# index(\_:offsetBy:)

**Framework:** Swift  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ · iPadOS 8.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.10+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

Returns an index that is the specified distance from the given index.

## Declaration

```swift
func index(_ i: Int, offsetBy distance: Int) -> Int
```

## Parameters

- `i`: A valid index of the array.
- `distance`: The distance to offset `i`.

## Return Value

An index offset by `distance` from the index `i`. If `distance` is positive, this is the same value as the result of `distance` calls to `index(after:)`. If `distance` is negative, this is the same value as the result of `abs(distance)` calls to `index(before:)`.

## Discussion

The following example obtains an index advanced four positions from an array’s starting index and then prints the element at that position.

```swift
let numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
let i = numbers.index(numbers.startIndex, offsetBy: 4)
print(numbers[i])
// Prints "50"
```

The value passed as `distance` must not offset `i` beyond the bounds of the collection.
