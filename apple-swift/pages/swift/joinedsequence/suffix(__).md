# suffix(\_:)

**Framework:** Swift  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ · iPadOS 8.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.10+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

Returns a subsequence, up to the given maximum length, containing the final elements of the sequence.

## Declaration

```swift
func suffix(_ maxLength: Int) -> [Self.Element]
```

## Parameters

- `maxLength`: The maximum number of elements to return. The value of `maxLength` must be greater than or equal to zero.

## Discussion

The sequence must be finite. If the maximum length exceeds the number of elements in the sequence, the result contains all the elements in the sequence.

```swift
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers.suffix(2))
// Prints "[4, 5]"
print(numbers.suffix(10))
// Prints "[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]"
```

> **Complexity**

> O(*n*), where *n* is the length of the sequence.
