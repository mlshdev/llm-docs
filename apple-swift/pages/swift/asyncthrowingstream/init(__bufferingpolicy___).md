# init(\_:bufferingPolicy:\_:)

**Framework:** Swift  
**Kind:** Initializer  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 13.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 6.0+

Constructs an asynchronous stream for an element type, using the specified buffering policy and element-producing closure.

## Declaration

```swift
init(_ elementType: Element.Type = Element.self, bufferingPolicy limit: AsyncThrowingStream<Element, Failure>.Continuation.BufferingPolicy = .unbounded, _ build: (AsyncThrowingStream<Element, Failure>.Continuation) -> Void) where Failure == any Error
```

## Parameters

- `elementType`: The type of element the `AsyncThrowingStream` produces.
- `limit`: The maximum number of elements to hold in the buffer. By default, this value is unlimited. Use a `Continuation.BufferingPolicy` to buffer a specified number of oldest or newest elements.
- `build`: A custom closure that yields values to the `AsyncThrowingStream`. This closure receives an `AsyncThrowingStream.Continuation` instance that it uses to provide elements to the stream and terminate the stream when finished.

## Discussion

The `AsyncStream.Continuation` received by the `build` closure is appropriate for use in concurrent contexts. It is thread safe to send and finish; all calls to the continuation are serialized. However, calling this from multiple concurrent contexts could result in out-of-order delivery.

The following example shows an `AsyncStream` created with this initializer that produces 100 random numbers on a one-second interval, calling `yield(_:)` to deliver each element to the awaiting call point. When the `for` loop exits, the stream finishes by calling the continuation’s `finish()` method. If the random number is divisible by 5 with no remainder, the stream throws a `MyRandomNumberError`.

```swift
let stream = AsyncThrowingStream<Int, Error>(Int.self,
                                             bufferingPolicy: .bufferingNewest(5)) { continuation in
    Task.detached {
        for _ in 0..<100 {
            await Task.sleep(1 * 1_000_000_000)
            let random = Int.random(in: 1...10)
            if random % 5 == 0 {
                continuation.finish(throwing: MyRandomNumberError())
                return
            } else {
                continuation.yield(random)
            }
        }
        continuation.finish()
    }
}

// Call point:
do {
    for try await random in stream {
        print(random)
    }
} catch {
    print(error)
}
```
