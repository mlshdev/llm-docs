# hash(into:)

**Framework:** Swift

## Discussion

Implement this method to conform to the `Hashable` protocol. The components used for hashing must be the same as the components compared in your type’s `==` operator implementation. Call `hasher.combine(_:)` with each of these components.

> **Important**

> In your implementation of `hash(into:)`, don’t call `finalize()` on the `hasher` instance provided, or replace it with a different instance. Doing so may become a compile-time error in the future.
