# AsyncThrowingStream.Continuation.YieldResult.enqueued(remaining:)

**Framework:** Swift  
**Kind:** Case  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 13.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 6.0+

The stream successfully enqueued the element.

## Declaration

```swift
case enqueued(remaining: Int)
```

## Discussion

This value represents the successful enqueueing of an element, whether the stream buffers the element or delivers it immediately to a pending call to `next()`. The associated value `remaining` is a hint that indicates the number of remaining slots in the buffer at the time of the `yield` call.

> **Note**

> From a thread safety perspective, `remaining` is a lower bound on the number of remaining slots. This is because a subsequent call that uses the `remaining` value could race on the consumption of values from the stream.

### Yield Results

- [AsyncThrowingStream.Continuation.YieldResult.dropped(\_:)](dropped%28__%29.md): The stream didn’t enqueue the element because the buffer was full.
- [AsyncThrowingStream.Continuation.YieldResult.terminated](terminated.md): The stream didn’t enqueue the element because the stream was in a terminal state.
