var onTermination: (@Sendable (AsyncThrowingStream<Element, Failure>.Continuation.Termination) -> Void)? { get nonmutating set }
```

## Discussion

If an `onTermination` callback is set, using task cancellation to terminate iteration of an `AsyncThrowingStream` results in a call to this callback.

Canceling an active iteration invokes the `onTermination` callback first, and then resumes by yielding `nil` or throwing an error from the iterator. This means that you can perform needed cleanup in the cancellation handler. After reaching a terminal state, the `AsyncThrowingStream` disposes of the callback.

> **Note**

> Because the system might call the `onTermination` callback as part of task cancellation, it’s subject to the same considerations for avoiding deadlock as outlined in the documentation for [withTaskCancellationHandler(operation:onCancel:)](../../withtaskcancellationhandler%28operation_oncancel_%29.md).
