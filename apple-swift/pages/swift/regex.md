# Regex

A regular expression.

## Declaration

```swift
struct Regex<Output>
```

## Overview

Regular expressions are a concise way of describing a pattern, which can help you match or extract portions of a string. You can create a `Regex` instance using regular expression syntax, either in a regex literal or a string.

```swift
// 'keyAndValue' is created using a regex literal
let keyAndValue = /(.+?): (.+)/
// 'simpleDigits' is created from a pattern in a string
let simpleDigits = try Regex("[0-9]+")
```

You can use a `Regex` to search for a pattern in a string or substring. Call `contains(_:)` to check for the presence of a pattern, or `firstMatch(of:)` or `matches(of:)` to find matches.

```swift
let setting = "color: 161 103 230"
if setting.contains(simpleDigits) {
    print("'\(setting)' contains some digits.")
}
// Prints "'color: 161 103 230' contains some digits."
```

When you find a match, the resulting [Regex.Match](regex/match.md) type includes an [output](regex/match/output.md) property that contains the matched substring along with any captures:

```swift
if let match = setting.firstMatch(of: keyAndValue) {
    print("Key: \(match.1)")
    print("Value: \(match.2)")
}
// Key: color
// Value: 161 103 230
```

When you import the `RegexBuilder` module, you can also create `Regex` instances using a clear and flexible declarative syntax. Using this style, you can combine, capture, and transform regexes, `RegexBuilder` types, and custom parsers.

> **Note**

>  Prior to Swift 6, you might need to write `#/myregex/#` instead of `/myregex/` when you make a regular expression using a literal. For more information, see [Regular Expression Literals](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/lexicalstructure/#Regular-Expression-Literals) in  *[The Swift Programming Language](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/)*.

## Topics

### Structures

- [Regex.Match](regex/match.md): The result of matching a regular expression against a string.

### Initializers

- [init(\_:)](regex/init%28__%29-4ef55.md): Creates a regular expression using a RegexBuilder closure.
- [init(\_:)](regex/init%28__%29-52kg.md): Conforms when `Output` is `AnyRegexOutput`. Creates a regular expression from the given string, using a dynamic capture list.
- [init(\_:)](regex/init%28__%29-92siq.md): Conforms when `Output` is `AnyRegexOutput`. Creates a regular expression with a dynamic capture list from the given regular expression.
- [init(\_:as:)](regex/init%28__as_%29-2ucu7.md): Creates a regular expression with a strongly-typed capture list from the given regular expression.
- [init(\_:as:)](regex/init%28__as_%29-5z5nu.md): Creates a regular expression from the given string, using the specified capture type.
- [init(verbatim:)](regex/init%28verbatim_%29.md): Creates a regular expression that matches the given string exactly, as though every metacharacter in it was escaped.

### Instance Properties

- [regex](regex/regex.md): The regular expression represented by this component.

### Instance Methods

- [anchorsMatchLineEndings(\_:)](regex/anchorsmatchlineendings%28__%29.md): Returns a regular expression where the start and end of input anchors (`^` and `$`) also match against the start and end of a line.
- [asciiOnlyCharacterClasses(\_:)](regex/asciionlycharacterclasses%28__%29.md): Returns a regular expression that matches only ASCII characters when matching character classes.
- [asciiOnlyDigits(\_:)](regex/asciionlydigits%28__%29.md): Returns a regular expression that matches only ASCII characters as digits.
- [asciiOnlyWhitespace(\_:)](regex/asciionlywhitespace%28__%29.md): Returns a regular expression that matches only ASCII characters as space characters.
- [asciiOnlyWordCharacters(\_:)](regex/asciionlywordcharacters%28__%29.md): Returns a regular expression that matches only ASCII characters as word characters.
- [contains(captureNamed:)](regex/contains%28capturenamed_%29.md): Returns a Boolean value indicating whether a named capture with the given name exists.
- [dotMatchesNewlines(\_:)](regex/dotmatchesnewlines%28__%29.md): Returns a regular expression where the “any” metacharacter (`.`) also matches against the start and end of a line.
- [firstMatch(in:)](regex/firstmatch%28in_%29-45hz7.md): Returns the first match for this regex found in the given substring.
- [firstMatch(in:)](regex/firstmatch%28in_%29-6s8x0.md): Returns the first match for this regex found in the given string.
- [ignoresCase(\_:)](regex/ignorescase%28__%29.md): Returns a regular expression that ignores case when matching.
- [matchingSemantics(\_:)](regex/matchingsemantics%28__%29.md): Returns a regular expression that matches with the specified semantic level.
- [prefixMatch(in:)](regex/prefixmatch%28in_%29-1an24.md): Returns a match if this regex matches the given substring at its start.
- [prefixMatch(in:)](regex/prefixmatch%28in_%29-5oh8i.md): Returns a match if this regex matches the given string at its start.
- [repetitionBehavior(\_:)](regex/repetitionbehavior%28__%29.md): Returns a regular expression where quantifiers use the specified behavior by default.
- [wholeMatch(in:)](regex/wholematch%28in_%29-8hr88.md): Returns a match if this regex matches the given substring in its entirety.
- [wholeMatch(in:)](regex/wholematch%28in_%29-9do8t.md): Returns a match if this regex matches the given string in its entirety.
- [wordBoundaryKind(\_:)](regex/wordboundarykind%28__%29.md): Returns a regular expression that uses the specified word boundary algorithm.

### Type Aliases

- [Regex.RegexOutput](regex/regexoutput.md): The output type for this regular expression.
