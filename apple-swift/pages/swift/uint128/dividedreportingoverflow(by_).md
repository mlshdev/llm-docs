# dividedReportingOverflow(by:)

**Framework:** Swift  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 18.0+ · iPadOS 18.0+ · Mac Catalyst 18.0+ · macOS 15.0+ · tvOS 18.0+ · visionOS 2.0+ · watchOS 11.0+

Returns the quotient obtained by dividing this value by the given value, along with a Boolean value indicating whether overflow occurred in the operation.

## Declaration

```swift
func dividedReportingOverflow(by other: UInt128) -> (partialValue: UInt128, overflow: Bool)
```

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

A tuple containing the result of the division along with a Boolean value indicating whether overflow occurred. If the `overflow` component is `false`, the `partialValue` component contains the entire quotient. If the `overflow` component is `true`, an overflow occurred and the `partialValue` component contains either the truncated quotient or, if the quotient is undefined, the dividend.

## Discussion

Dividing by zero is not an error when using this method. For a value `x`, the result of `x.dividedReportingOverflow(by: 0)` is `(x, true)`.
