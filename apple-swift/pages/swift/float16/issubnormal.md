## Discussion

A *subnormal* value is a nonzero number that has a lesser magnitude than the smallest normal number. Subnormal values don’t use the full precision available to values of a type.

Zero is neither a normal nor a subnormal number. Subnormal numbers are often called *denormal* or *denormalized*—these are different names for the same concept.
