# span

**Framework:** Swift  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 26.0+ · iPadOS 26.0+ · Mac Catalyst 26.0+ · macOS 26.0+ · tvOS 26.0+ · visionOS 26.0+ · watchOS 26.0+

A span over the UTF-8 code units that make up this substring.

## Declaration

```swift
var span: Span<UTF8.CodeUnit> { get }
```

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

A `Span` over the UTF-8 code units of this `Substring`.

## Discussion

> **Note**

> On Apple platforms, this property must transcode the code units of bridged UTF-16 `String` instances on every access.
>
> For example, if `string` has the bridged UTF-16 representation,

```swift
  for word in string.split(separator: " ") {
      useSpan(word.span)
  }
```

is accidentally quadratic because of this issue. A workaround is to explicitly convert the string into its native UTF-8 representation:

```swift
  var nativeString = consume string
  nativeString.makeContiguousUTF8()
  for word in nativeString.split(separator: " ") {
      useSpan(word.span)
  }
```

This second option has linear time complexity, as expected.

> **Complexity**

> O(1) for native UTF-8 strings, O(*n*) for bridged UTF-16 strings.
