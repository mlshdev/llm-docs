# ReversedCollection

**Framework:** Swift  
**Kind:** Structure  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ · iPadOS 8.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.10+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

A collection that presents the elements of its base collection in reverse order.

## Declaration

```swift
@frozen struct ReversedCollection<Base> where Base : BidirectionalCollection
```

## Overview

> **Note**

> This type is the result of `x.reversed()` where `x` is a collection having bidirectional indices.

The `reversed()` method is always lazy when applied to a collection with bidirectional indices, but does not implicitly confer laziness on algorithms applied to its result.  In other words, for ordinary collections `c` having bidirectional indices:

- `c.reversed()` does not create new storage
- `c.reversed().map(f)` maps eagerly and returns a new array
- `c.lazy.reversed().map(f)` maps lazily and returns a `LazyMapCollection`

## Topics

### Instance Methods

- [reversed()](reversedcollection/reversed%28%29.md): Conforms when `Base` conforms to `BidirectionalCollection`. Reversing a reversed collection returns the original collection.
