## Discussion

The positive difference between 1.0 and the next greater representable number. `ulpOfOne` corresponds to the value represented by the C macros `FLT_EPSILON`, `DBL_EPSILON`, etc, and is sometimes called *epsilon* or *machine epsilon*. Swift deliberately avoids using the term “epsilon” because:

- Historically “epsilon” has been used to refer to several different concepts in different languages, leading to confusion and bugs.
- The name “epsilon” suggests that this quantity is a good tolerance to choose for approximate comparisons, but it is almost always unsuitable for that purpose.
