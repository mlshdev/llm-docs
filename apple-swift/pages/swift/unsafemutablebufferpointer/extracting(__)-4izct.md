# extracting(\_:)

**Framework:** Swift  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ · iPadOS 8.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.10+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

Constructs a standalone buffer pointer over the items within the supplied range of positions in the memory region addressed by this buffer pointer.

## Declaration

```swift
func extracting(_ bounds: Range<Int>) -> UnsafeMutableBufferPointer<Element>
```

## Parameters

- `bounds`: A valid range of indices within this buffer.

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

A new buffer pointer over the items at `bounds`.

<a id="discussion"></a>

## Discussion

The returned buffer’s first item is always at index 0; unlike buffer slices, extracted buffers do not generally share their indices with the original buffer pointer.

```swift
withUnsafeTemporaryAllocation(of: Int.self, capacity: 5) { buffer in
  buffer.initialize(repeating: 0)
  // buffer contains [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  let part = buffer.extracting(2 ..< 4)
  part[0] = 1
  part[1] = 2
  // buffer now contains [0, 0, 1, 2, 0]
}
```

When `Element` is copyable, the `extracting` operation is equivalent to slicing the buffer then rebasing the resulting buffer slice:

```swift
let a = buffer.extracting(i ..< j)
let b = UnsafeBufferPointer(rebasing: buffer[i ..< j])
// `a` and `b` are now holding the same buffer
```

However, unlike slicing, the `extracting` operation remains available even if `Element` happens to be noncopyable.
