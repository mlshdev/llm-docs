# FloatingPointRoundingRule

**Framework:** Swift  
**Kind:** Enumeration  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ · iPadOS 8.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.10+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

A rule for rounding a floating-point number.

## Declaration

```swift
enum FloatingPointRoundingRule
```

## Topics

### Operators

- [==(\_:\_:)](floatingpointroundingrule/==%28____%29.md): Returns a Boolean value indicating whether two values are equal.

### Enumeration Cases

- [FloatingPointRoundingRule.awayFromZero](floatingpointroundingrule/awayfromzero.md): Round to the closest allowed value whose magnitude is greater than or equal to that of the source.
- [FloatingPointRoundingRule.down](floatingpointroundingrule/down.md): Round to the closest allowed value that is less than or equal to the source.
- [FloatingPointRoundingRule.toNearestOrAwayFromZero](floatingpointroundingrule/tonearestorawayfromzero.md): Round to the closest allowed value; if two values are equally close, the one with greater magnitude is chosen.
- [FloatingPointRoundingRule.toNearestOrEven](floatingpointroundingrule/tonearestoreven.md): Round to the closest allowed value; if two values are equally close, the even one is chosen.
- [FloatingPointRoundingRule.towardZero](floatingpointroundingrule/towardzero.md): Round to the closest allowed value whose magnitude is less than or equal to that of the source.
- [FloatingPointRoundingRule.up](floatingpointroundingrule/up.md): Round to the closest allowed value that is greater than or equal to the source.

### Instance Properties

- [hashValue](floatingpointroundingrule/hashvalue.md): The hash value.

### Instance Methods

- [hash(into:)](floatingpointroundingrule/hash%28into_%29.md): Hashes the essential components of this value by feeding them into the given hasher.
