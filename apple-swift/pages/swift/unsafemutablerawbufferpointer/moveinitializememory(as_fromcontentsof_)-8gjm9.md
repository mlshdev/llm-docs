# moveInitializeMemory(as:fromContentsOf:)

**Framework:** Swift  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ · iPadOS 8.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.10+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

Moves every element of an initialized source buffer slice into the uninitialized memory referenced by this buffer, leaving the source memory uninitialized and this buffer’s memory initialized.

## Declaration

```swift
@discardableResult func moveInitializeMemory<T>(as type: T.Type, fromContentsOf source: Slice<UnsafeMutableBufferPointer<T>>) -> UnsafeMutableBufferPointer<T>
```

## Parameters

- `type`: The type of element to which this buffer’s memory will be bound.
- `source`: A buffer referencing the values to copy. The memory region underlying `source` must be initialized.

## Return Value

A typed buffer referencing the initialized elements. The returned buffer references memory starting at the same base address as this buffer, and its count is equal to `source.count`.

## Discussion

When calling the `moveInitializeMemory(as:fromContentsOf:)` method, the memory referenced by the buffer must be uninitialized, or initialized to a trivial type. The buffer must reference enough memory to store `source.count` elements, and its `baseAddress` must be properly aligned for accessing `C.Element`. After the method returns, the memory referenced by the returned buffer is initialized and the memory region underlying `source` is uninitialized.

This method initializes the buffer with the contents of `source` until `source` is exhausted. After calling `initializeMemory(as:fromContentsOf:)`, the memory referenced by the returned `UnsafeMutableBufferPointer` instance is bound to the type `T` and is initialized. This method does not change the binding state of the unused portion of the buffer, if any.

> **Note**

> The memory regions referenced by `source` and this buffer may overlap.
