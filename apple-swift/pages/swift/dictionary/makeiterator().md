# makeIterator()

**Framework:** Swift

Returns an iterator over the dictionary’s key-value pairs.

## Declaration

```swift
func makeIterator() -> Dictionary<Key, Value>.Iterator
```

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

An iterator over the dictionary with elements of type `(key: Key, value: Value)`.

## Discussion

Iterating over a dictionary yields the key-value pairs as two-element tuples. You can decompose the tuple in a `for`-`in` loop, which calls `makeIterator()` behind the scenes, or when calling the iterator’s `next()` method directly.

```swift
let hues = ["Heliotrope": 296, "Coral": 16, "Aquamarine": 156]
for (name, hueValue) in hues {
    print("The hue of \(name) is \(hueValue).")
}
// Prints "The hue of Heliotrope is 296."
// Prints "The hue of Coral is 16."
// Prints "The hue of Aquamarine is 156."
```

### Iterating over Keys and Values

- [forEach(\_:)](foreach%28__%29.md): Calls the given closure on each element in the sequence in the same order as a `for`-`in` loop.
- [enumerated()](enumerated%28%29.md): Returns a sequence of pairs (*n*, *x*), where *n* represents a consecutive integer starting at zero and *x* represents an element of the sequence.
- [lazy](lazy.md): A sequence containing the same elements as this sequence, but on which some operations, such as `map` and `filter`, are implemented lazily.
- [underestimatedCount](underestimatedcount.md): A value less than or equal to the number of elements in the collection.
