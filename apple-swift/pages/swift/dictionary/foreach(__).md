# forEach(\_:)

**Framework:** Swift  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ · iPadOS 8.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.10+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

Calls the given closure on each element in the sequence in the same order as a `for`-`in` loop.

## Declaration

```swift
func forEach(_ body: (Self.Element) throws -> Void) rethrows
```

## Parameters

- `body`: A closure that takes an element of the sequence as a parameter.

## Discussion

The two loops in the following example produce the same output:

```swift
let numberWords = ["one", "two", "three"]
for word in numberWords {
    print(word)
}
// Prints "one"
// Prints "two"
// Prints "three"

numberWords.forEach { word in
    print(word)
}
// Same as above
```

Using the `forEach` method is distinct from a `for`-`in` loop in two important ways:

1. You cannot use a `break` or `continue` statement to exit the current call of the `body` closure or skip subsequent calls.
2. Using the `return` statement in the `body` closure will exit only from the current call to `body`, not from any outer scope, and won’t skip subsequent calls.

### Iterating over Keys and Values

- [enumerated()](enumerated%28%29.md): Returns a sequence of pairs (*n*, *x*), where *n* represents a consecutive integer starting at zero and *x* represents an element of the sequence.
- [lazy](lazy.md): A sequence containing the same elements as this sequence, but on which some operations, such as `map` and `filter`, are implemented lazily.
- [makeIterator()](makeiterator%28%29.md): Conforms when `Key` conforms to `Hashable`. Returns an iterator over the dictionary’s key-value pairs.
- [underestimatedCount](underestimatedcount.md): A value less than or equal to the number of elements in the collection.
