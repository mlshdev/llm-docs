Resume the task awaiting the continuation by having it either return normally or throw an error based on the state of the given `Result` value.

## Discussion

A continuation must be resumed exactly once. If the continuation has already been resumed through this object, then the attempt to resume the continuation will trap.

After `resume` enqueues the task, control immediately returns to the caller. The task continues executing when its executor is able to reschedule it.
