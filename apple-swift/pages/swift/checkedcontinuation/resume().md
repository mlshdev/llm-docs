Resume the task awaiting the continuation by having it return normally from its suspension point.

## Declaration

```swift
func resume() where T == ()
```

## Discussion

A continuation must be resumed exactly once. If the continuation has already been resumed through this object, then the attempt to resume the continuation will trap.

After `resume` enqueues the task, control immediately returns to the caller. The task continues executing when its executor is able to reschedule it.
