# isKnownASCII

**Framework:** Swift  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 26.0+ · iPadOS 26.0+ · Mac Catalyst 26.0+ · macOS 26.0+ · tvOS 26.0+ · visionOS 26.0+ · watchOS 26.0+

Returns whether contents are known to be all-ASCII. A return value of `true` means that all code units are ASCII. A return value of `false` means there *may* be non-ASCII content.

## Declaration

```swift
var isKnownASCII: Bool { get }
```

## Discussion

ASCII-ness is checked and remembered during UTF-8 validation, so this is often equivalent to is-ASCII, but there are some situations where we might return `false` even when the content happens to be all-ASCII.

For example, a UTF-8 span generated from a `String` that at some point contained non-ASCII content would report false for `isKnownASCII`, even if that String had subsequent mutation operations that removed any non-ASCII content.
