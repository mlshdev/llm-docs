## Discussion

Note: This is only for very specific, low-level use cases. If `codeUnitOffset` is not properly scalar-aligned, this function can result in undefined behavior when, e.g., `next()` is called.

If `i` is scalar-aligned, but not `Character`-aligned, you may get different results from running `Character` iteration.

For example, this could be used by a regex engine to backtrack to a known-valid previous position.
