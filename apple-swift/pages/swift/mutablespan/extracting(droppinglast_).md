# extracting(droppingLast:)

**Framework:** Swift  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 12.2+ · iPadOS 12.2+ · Mac Catalyst 12.2+ · macOS 10.14.4+ · tvOS 12.2+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 5.2+

Returns a span over all but the given number of trailing elements.

## Declaration

```swift
mutating func extracting(droppingLast k: Int) -> MutableSpan<Element>
```

## Parameters

- `k`: The number of elements to drop off the end of the span. `k` must be greater than or equal to zero.

## Return Value

A span leaving off the specified number of elements at the end.

<a id="discussion"></a>

## Discussion

If the number of elements to drop exceeds the number of elements in the span, the result is an empty span.

The returned span represents a mutation of this span.

The returned span’s first item is always at offset 0; unlike buffer slices, extracted spans do not share their indices with the span from which they are extracted.
