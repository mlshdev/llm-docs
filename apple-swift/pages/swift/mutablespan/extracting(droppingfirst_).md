# extracting(droppingFirst:)

**Framework:** Swift  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 12.2+ · iPadOS 12.2+ · Mac Catalyst 12.2+ · macOS 10.14.4+ · tvOS 12.2+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 5.2+

Returns a span over all but the given number of initial elements.

## Return Value

A span starting after the specified number of elements.

## Discussion

If the number of elements to drop exceeds the number of elements in the span, the result is an empty span.

The returned span represents a mutation of this span.

The returned span’s first item is always at offset 0; unlike buffer slices, extracted spans do not share their indices with the span from which they are extracted.
