# max()

**Framework:** Swift  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 13.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 6.0+

Returns the maximum element in an asynchronous sequence of comparable elements.

## Declaration

```swift
@warn_unqualified_access func max() async rethrows -> Self.Element?
```

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

The sequence’s maximum element. If the sequence has no elements, returns `nil`.

## Discussion

In this example, an asynchronous sequence called `Counter` produces `Int` values from `1` to `10`. The `max()` method returns the max value of the sequence.

```swift
let max = await Counter(howHigh: 10)
    .max()
print(max ?? "none")
// Prints "10"
```

- [makeAsyncIterator()](makeasynciterator%28%29.md): Conforms when `ChildTaskResult` conforms to `Sendable` and `Failure` conforms to `Error`. Creates the asynchronous iterator that produces elements of this asynchronous sequence.
- [allSatisfy(\_:)](allsatisfy%28__%29.md): Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether all elements produced by the asynchronous sequence satisfy the given predicate.
- [compactMap(\_:)](compactmap%28__%29-944nh.md): Creates an asynchronous sequence that maps an error-throwing closure over the base sequence’s elements, omitting results that don’t return a value.
- [compactMap(\_:)](compactmap%28__%29-7mgi5.md): Creates an asynchronous sequence that maps the given closure over the asynchronous sequence’s elements, omitting results that don’t return a value.
- [contains(\_:)](contains%28__%29.md): Conforms when `Element` conforms to `Equatable`. Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the asynchronous sequence contains the given element.
- [contains(where:)](contains%28where_%29.md): Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the asynchronous sequence contains an element that satisfies the given predicate.
- [drop(while:)](drop%28while_%29.md): Omits elements from the base asynchronous sequence until a given closure returns false, after which it passes through all remaining elements.
- [dropFirst(\_:)](dropfirst%28__%29.md): Omits a specified number of elements from the base asynchronous sequence, then passes through all remaining elements.
- [filter(\_:)](filter%28__%29.md): Creates an asynchronous sequence that contains, in order, the elements of the base sequence that satisfy the given predicate.
- [first(where:)](first%28where_%29.md): Returns the first element of the sequence that satisfies the given predicate.
- [map(\_:)](map%28__%29-58nrv.md): Creates an asynchronous sequence that maps the given error-throwing closure over the asynchronous sequence’s elements.
- [map(\_:)](map%28__%29-4a4ju.md): Creates an asynchronous sequence that maps the given closure over the asynchronous sequence’s elements.
- [max(by:)](max%28by_%29.md): Returns the maximum element in the asynchronous sequence, using the given predicate as the comparison between elements.
- [min()](min%28%29.md): Conforms when `Element` conforms to `Comparable`. Returns the minimum element in an asynchronous sequence of comparable elements.
- [min(by:)](min%28by_%29.md): Returns the minimum element in the asynchronous sequence, using the given predicate as the comparison between elements.
