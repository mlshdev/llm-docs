Calls the given closure with a pointer to the underlying bytes of the viewed contiguous storage.

## Declaration

```swift
func withUnsafeBytes<E, Result>(_ body: (UnsafeRawBufferPointer) throws(E) -> Result) throws(E) -> Result where E : Error, Result : ~Copyable
```

## Parameters

- `body`: A closure with an `UnsafeRawBufferPointer` parameter that points to the viewed contiguous storage. If `body` has a return value, that value is also used as the return value for the `withUnsafeBytes(_:)` method. The closure’s parameter is valid only for the duration of its execution.
