Suspend task execution until a given deadline within a tolerance. If no tolerance is specified then the system may adjust the deadline to coalesce CPU wake-ups to more efficiently process the wake-ups in a more power efficient manner.

## Declaration

```swift
func sleep(until deadline: ContinuousClock.Instant, tolerance: Duration? = nil) async throws
```
