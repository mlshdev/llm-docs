## Discussion

If the predicate hasn’t failed yet, this method gets the next element from the base sequence and calls the predicate with it. If this call succeeds, this method passes along the element. Otherwise, it returns `nil`, ending the sequence. If calling the predicate closure throws an error, the sequence ends and `next()` rethrows the error.
