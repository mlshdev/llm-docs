# flatMap(\_:)

**Framework:** Swift  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 13.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 6.0+

Creates an asynchronous sequence that concatenates the results of calling the given transformation with each element of this sequence.

## Declaration

```swift
@preconcurrency func flatMap<SegmentOfResult>(_ transform: @escaping @Sendable (Self.Element) async -> SegmentOfResult) -> AsyncFlatMapSequence<Self, SegmentOfResult> where SegmentOfResult : AsyncSequence, Self.Failure == SegmentOfResult.Failure
```

## Parameters

- `transform`: A mapping closure. `transform` accepts an element of this sequence as its parameter and returns an `AsyncSequence`.

## Return Value

A single, flattened asynchronous sequence that contains all elements in all the asynchronous sequences produced by `transform`.

## Discussion

Use this method to receive a single-level asynchronous sequence when your transformation produces an asynchronous sequence for each element.

In this example, an asynchronous sequence called `Counter` produces `Int` values from `1` to `5`. The transforming closure takes the received `Int` and returns a new `Counter` that counts that high. For example, when the transform receives `3` from the base sequence, it creates a new `Counter` that produces the values `1`, `2`, and `3`. The `flatMap(_:)` method “flattens” the resulting sequence-of-sequences into a single `AsyncSequence`.

```swift
let stream = Counter(howHigh: 5)
    .flatMap { Counter(howHigh: $0) }
for await number in stream {
    print(number, terminator: " ")
}
// Prints "1 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 5 "
```
