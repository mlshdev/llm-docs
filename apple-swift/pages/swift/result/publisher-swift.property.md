# publisher

**Framework:** Swift  
**Kind:** Instance Property

A Combine publisher that publishes this instance’s result to each subscriber exactly once, or fails immediately if the result indicates failure.

## Declaration

```swift
var publisher: Result<Success, Failure>.Publisher { get }
```

## Discussion

In the following example, `goodResult` provides a successful result with the integer value `1`. A sink subscriber connected to the result’s publisher receives the output `1`, followed by a normal completion ([Subscribers.Completion.finished](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subscribers/completion/finished)).

```swift
 let goodResult: Result<Int, MyError> = .success(1)
 goodResult.publisher
     .sink(receiveCompletion: { print("goodResult done: \($0)")},
           receiveValue: { print("goodResult value: \($0)")} )
 // Prints:
 // goodResult value: 1
 // goodResult done: finished
```

In contrast with the [Just](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/just) publisher, which always publishes a single value, this publisher might not send any values and instead terminate with an error, if the result is `/Swift/Result/failure`. In the next example, `badResult` is a failure result that wraps a custom error. A sink subscriber connected to this result’s publisher immediately receives a termination ([Subscribers.Completion.failure(\_:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subscribers/completion/failure%28_:%29)).

```swift
 struct MyError: Error, CustomDebugStringConvertible {
     var debugDescription: String = "MyError"
 }
 let badResult: Result<Int, MyError> = .failure(MyError())
 badResult.publisher
     .sink(receiveCompletion: { print("badResult done: \($0)")},
           receiveValue: { print("badResult value: \($0)")} )
 // Prints:
 // badResult done: failure(MyError)
```
