# subscript(\_:)

**Framework:** Swift  
**Kind:** Instance Subscript  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ · iPadOS 8.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.10+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+ · Swift 4.0+

Accesses a contiguous subrange of the collection’s elements.

## Declaration

```swift
subscript(r: Range<String.Index>) -> Substring { get }
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

The accessed slice uses the same indices for the same elements as the original collection uses. Always use the slice’s `startIndex` property instead of assuming that its indices start at a particular value.

This example demonstrates getting a slice of an array of strings, finding the index of one of the strings in the slice, and then using that index in the original array.

```swift
let streets = ["Adams", "Bryant", "Channing", "Douglas", "Evarts"]
let streetsSlice = streets[2 ..< streets.endIndex]
print(streetsSlice)
// Prints "["Channing", "Douglas", "Evarts"]"

let index = streetsSlice.firstIndex(of: "Evarts")    // 4
print(streets[index!])
// Prints "Evarts"
```

- [subscript(\_:)](subscript%28__%29-4h7s3.md): Accesses the contiguous subrange of the collection’s elements specified by a range expression.
- [subscript(\_:)](subscript%28__%29-4al9c.md)
- [prefix(\_:)](prefix%28__%29.md): Returns a subsequence, up to the specified maximum length, containing the initial elements of the collection.
- [prefix(through:)](prefix%28through_%29.md): Returns a subsequence from the start of the collection through the specified position.
- [prefix(upTo:)](prefix%28upto_%29.md): Returns a subsequence from the start of the collection up to, but not including, the specified position.
- [prefix(while:)](prefix%28while_%29.md): Returns a subsequence containing the initial elements until `predicate` returns `false` and skipping the remaining elements.
- [suffix(\_:)](suffix%28__%29.md): Returns a subsequence, up to the given maximum length, containing the final elements of the collection.
- [suffix(from:)](suffix%28from_%29.md): Returns a subsequence from the specified position to the end of the collection.
