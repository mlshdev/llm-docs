# filter(\_:)

**Framework:** Swift  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ · iPadOS 8.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.10+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+ · Swift 4.0+

Returns a new collection of the same type containing, in order, the elements of the original collection that satisfy the given predicate.

## Declaration

```swift
consuming func filter<E>(_ isIncluded: (Self.Element) throws(E) -> Bool) throws(E) -> Self where E : Error
```

## Parameters

- `isIncluded`: A closure that takes an element of the sequence as its argument and returns a Boolean value indicating whether the element should be included in the returned collection.

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

A collection of the elements that `isIncluded` allowed.

<a id="discussion"></a>

## Discussion

In this example, `filter(_:)` is used to include only names shorter than five characters.

```swift
let cast = ["Vivien", "Marlon", "Kim", "Karl"]
let shortNames = cast.filter { $0.count < 5 }
print(shortNames)
// Prints "["Kim", "Karl"]"
```

> **Complexity**

> O(*n*), where *n* is the length of the collection.
