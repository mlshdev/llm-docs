### Manipulating Indices

- [endIndex](endindex.md): A string’s “past the end” position—that is, the position one greater than the last valid subscript argument.
- [index(after:)](index%28after_%29.md): Returns the position immediately after the given index.
- [formIndex(after:)](formindex%28after_%29.md): Replaces the given index with its successor.
- [index(before:)](index%28before_%29.md): Returns the position immediately before the given index.
- [formIndex(before:)](formindex%28before_%29.md): Replaces the given index with its predecessor.
- [index(\_:offsetBy:)](index%28__offsetby_%29.md): Returns an index that is the specified distance from the given index.
- [index(\_:offsetBy:limitedBy:)](index%28__offsetby_limitedby_%29.md): Returns an index that is the specified distance from the given index, unless that distance is beyond a given limiting index.
- [formIndex(\_:offsetBy:)](formindex%28__offsetby_%29.md): Offsets the given index by the specified distance.
- [formIndex(\_:offsetBy:limitedBy:)](formindex%28__offsetby_limitedby_%29.md): Offsets the given index by the specified distance, or so that it equals the given limiting index.
- [distance(from:to:)](distance%28from_to_%29.md): Returns the distance between two indices.
- [indices](indices-swift.property.md): Conforms when `Indices` is `DefaultIndices<Self>`. The indices that are valid for subscripting the collection, in ascending order.
