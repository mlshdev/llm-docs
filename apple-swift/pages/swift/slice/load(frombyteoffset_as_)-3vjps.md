# load(fromByteOffset:as:)

**Framework:** Swift  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ · iPadOS 8.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.10+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

Returns a new instance of the given type, read from the specified offset into the buffer pointer slice’s raw memory.

## Declaration

```swift
func load<T>(fromByteOffset offset: Int = 0, as type: T.Type) -> T
```

## Parameters

- `offset`: The offset into the slice’s memory, in bytes, at which to begin reading data for the new instance. The default is zero.
- `type`: The type to use for the newly constructed instance. The memory must be initialized to a value of a type that is layout compatible with `type`.

## Return Value

A new instance of type `T`, copied from the buffer pointer slice’s memory.

## Discussion

The memory at `offset` bytes into this buffer pointer slice must be properly aligned for accessing `T` and initialized to `T` or another type that is layout compatible with `T`.

You can use this method to create new values from the underlying buffer pointer’s bytes. The following example creates two new `Int32` instances from the memory referenced by the buffer pointer `someBytes`. The bytes for `a` are copied from the first four bytes of `someBytes`, and the bytes for `b` are copied from the next four bytes.

```swift
let a = someBytes[0..<4].load(as: Int32.self)
let b = someBytes[4..<8].load(as: Int32.self)
```

The memory to read for the new instance must not extend beyond the memory region represented by the buffer pointer slice—that is, `offset + MemoryLayout<T>.size` must be less than or equal to the slice’s `count`.
