# bindMemory(to:)

**Framework:** Swift  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ · iPadOS 8.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.10+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

Binds this buffer slice’s memory to the specified type and returns a typed buffer of the bound memory.

## Declaration

```swift
@discardableResult func bindMemory<T>(to type: T.Type) -> UnsafeBufferPointer<T> where T : ~Copyable
```

## Parameters

- `type`: The type `T` to bind the memory to.

## Return Value

A typed buffer of the newly bound memory. The memory in this region is bound to `T`, but has not been modified in any other way. The typed buffer references `self.count / MemoryLayout<T>.stride` instances of `T`.

## Discussion

Use the `bindMemory(to:)` method to bind the memory referenced by this buffer slice to the type `T`. The memory must be uninitialized or initialized to a type that is layout compatible with `T`. If the memory is uninitialized, it is still uninitialized after being bound to `T`.

> **Warning**

> A memory location may only be bound to one type at a time. The behavior of accessing memory as a type unrelated to its bound type is undefined.
