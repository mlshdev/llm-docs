## Discussion

Ideographic description characters are technically printable characters, but advanced rendering engines may use them to approximate ideographs that are otherwise unrepresentable.

This property corresponds to the “IDS_Binary_Operator” property in the [Unicode Standard](http://www.unicode.org/versions/latest/).
