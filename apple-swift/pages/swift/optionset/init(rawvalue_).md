# init(rawValue:)

**Framework:** Swift  
**Kind:** Initializer  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ · iPadOS 8.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.10+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

Creates a new option set from the given raw value.

## Declaration

```swift
init(rawValue: Self.RawValue)
```

## Parameters

- `rawValue`: The raw value of the option set to create. Each bit of `rawValue` potentially represents an element of the option set, though raw values may include bits that are not defined as distinct values of the `OptionSet` type.

## Discussion

This initializer always succeeds, even if the value passed as `rawValue` exceeds the static properties declared as part of the option set. This example creates an instance of `ShippingOptions` with a raw value beyond the highest element, with a bit mask that effectively contains all the declared static members.

```swift
let extraOptions = ShippingOptions(rawValue: 255)
print(extraOptions.isStrictSuperset(of: .all))
// Prints "true"
```
