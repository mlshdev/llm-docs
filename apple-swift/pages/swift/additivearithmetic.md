# AdditiveArithmetic

**Framework:** Swift  
**Kind:** Protocol  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ · iPadOS 8.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.10+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

A type with values that support addition and subtraction.

## Declaration

```swift
protocol AdditiveArithmetic : Equatable
```

## Overview

The `AdditiveArithmetic` protocol provides a suitable basis for additive arithmetic on scalar values, such as integers and floating-point numbers, or vectors. You can write generic methods that operate on any numeric type in the standard library by using the `AdditiveArithmetic` protocol as a generic constraint.

The following code declares a method that calculates the total of any sequence with `AdditiveArithmetic` elements.

```swift
extension Sequence where Element: AdditiveArithmetic {
    func sum() -> Element {
        return reduce(.zero, +)
    }
}
```

The `sum()` method is now available on any sequence with values that conform to `AdditiveArithmetic`, whether it is an array of `Double` or a range of `Int`.

```swift
let arraySum = [1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5].sum()
// arraySum == 16.5

let rangeSum = (1..<10).sum()
// rangeSum == 45
```

## Conforming to the AdditiveArithmetic Protocol

To add `AdditiveArithmetic` protocol conformance to your own custom type, implement the required operators, and provide a static `zero` property.

## Topics

### Operators

- [+(\_:)](additivearithmetic/+%28__%29.md): Returns the given number unchanged.
- [+(\_:\_:)](additivearithmetic/+%28____%29.md): Adds two values and produces their sum.
- [+=(\_:\_:)](additivearithmetic/+=%28____%29.md): Adds two values and stores the result in the left-hand-side variable.
- [-(\_:\_:)](additivearithmetic/-%28____%29.md): Subtracts one value from another and produces their difference.
- [-=(\_:\_:)](additivearithmetic/-=%28____%29.md): Subtracts the second value from the first and stores the difference in the left-hand-side variable.

### Type Properties

- [zero](additivearithmetic/zero.md): The zero value.
