## Discussion

Use this method to remove every element in a collection that meets particular criteria. The order of the remaining elements is preserved. This example removes all the vowels from a string:

```swift
var phrase = "The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain."

let vowels: Set<Character> = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]
phrase.removeAll(where: { vowels.contains($0) })
// phrase == "Th rn n Spn stys mnly n th pln."
```

> **Complexity**

> O(*n*), where *n* is the length of the collection.
