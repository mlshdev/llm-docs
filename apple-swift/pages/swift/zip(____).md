# zip(\_:\_:)

**Framework:** Swift  
**Kind:** Function  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ · iPadOS 8.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.10+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

Creates a sequence of pairs built out of two underlying sequences.

## Declaration

```swift
func zip<Sequence1, Sequence2>(_ sequence1: Sequence1, _ sequence2: Sequence2) -> Zip2Sequence<Sequence1, Sequence2> where Sequence1 : Sequence, Sequence2 : Sequence
```

## Parameters

- `sequence1`: The first sequence or collection to zip.
- `sequence2`: The second sequence or collection to zip.

## Return Value

A sequence of tuple pairs, where the elements of each pair are corresponding elements of `sequence1` and `sequence2`.

## Discussion

In the `Zip2Sequence` instance returned by this function, the elements of the *i*th pair are the *i*th elements of each underlying sequence. The following example uses the `zip(_:_:)` function to iterate over an array of strings and a countable range at the same time:

```swift
let words = ["one", "two", "three", "four"]
let numbers = 1...4

for (word, number) in zip(words, numbers) {
    print("\(word): \(number)")
}
// Prints "one: 1"
// Prints "two: 2"
// Prints "three: 3"
// Prints "four: 4"
```

If the two sequences passed to `zip(_:_:)` are different lengths, the resulting sequence is the same length as the shorter sequence. In this example, the resulting array is the same length as `words`:

```swift
let naturalNumbers = 1...Int.max
let zipped = Array(zip(words, naturalNumbers))
// zipped == [("one", 1), ("two", 2), ("three", 3), ("four", 4)]
```
