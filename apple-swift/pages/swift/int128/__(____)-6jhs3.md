Returns the result of shifting a value’s binary representation the specified number of digits to the left.

## Declaration

```swift
static func << <RHS>(lhs: Self, rhs: RHS) -> Self where RHS : BinaryInteger
```

## Parameters

- `lhs`: The value to shift.
- `rhs`: The number of bits to shift `lhs` to the left.

## Discussion

The `<<` operator performs a *smart shift*, which defines a result for a shift of any value.

- Using a negative value for `rhs` performs a right shift using `abs(rhs)`.
- Using a value for `rhs` that is greater than or equal to the bit width of `lhs` is an *overshift*, resulting in zero.
- Using any other value for `rhs` performs a left shift on `lhs` by that amount.

The following example defines `x` as an instance of `UInt8`, an 8-bit, unsigned integer type. If you use `2` as the right-hand-side value in an operation on `x`, the value is shifted left by two bits.

```swift
let x: UInt8 = 30                 // 0b00011110
let y = x << 2
// y == 120                       // 0b01111000
```

If you use `11` as `rhs`, `x` is overshifted such that all of its bits are set to zero.

```swift
let z = x << 11
// z == 0                         // 0b00000000
```

Using a negative value as `rhs` is the same as performing a right shift with `abs(rhs)`.

```swift
let a = x << -3
// a == 3                         // 0b00000011
let b = x >> 3
// b == 3                         // 0b00000011
```
