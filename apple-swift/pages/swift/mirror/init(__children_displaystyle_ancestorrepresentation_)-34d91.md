# init(\_:children:displayStyle:ancestorRepresentation:)

**Framework:** Swift  
**Kind:** Initializer  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ · iPadOS 8.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.10+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

Creates a mirror representing the given subject using a dictionary literal for the structure.

## Declaration

```swift
init<Subject>(_ subject: Subject, children: KeyValuePairs<String, Any>, displayStyle: Mirror.DisplayStyle? = nil, ancestorRepresentation: Mirror.AncestorRepresentation = .generated)
```

## Parameters

- `subject`: The instance to represent in the new mirror.
- `children`: A dictionary literal to use as the structure for the mirror. The `children` collection of the resulting mirror may be upgraded to a random access collection later. See the `children` property for details.
- `displayStyle`: The preferred display style for the mirror when presented in the debugger or in a playground. The default is `nil`.
- `ancestorRepresentation`: The means of generating the subject’s ancestor representation. `ancestorRepresentation` is ignored if `subject` is not a class instance. The default is `.generated`.

## Discussion

You use this initializer from within your type’s `customMirror` implementation to create a customized mirror. Pass a dictionary literal with string keys as `children`. Although an *actual* dictionary is arbitrarily-ordered, when you create a mirror with a dictionary literal, the ordering of the mirror’s `children` will exactly match that of the literal you pass.

If `subject` is a class instance, `ancestorRepresentation` determines whether ancestor classes will be represented and whether their `customMirror` implementations will be used. By default, the `customMirror` implementation of any ancestors is ignored. To prevent bypassing customized ancestors, pass `.customized({ super.customMirror })` as the `ancestorRepresentation` parameter when implementing your type’s `customMirror` property.
