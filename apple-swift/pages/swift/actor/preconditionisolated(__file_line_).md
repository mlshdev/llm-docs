# preconditionIsolated(\_:file:line:)

**Framework:** Swift  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 13.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 6.0+

Stops program execution if the current task is not executing on this actor’s serial executor.

## Declaration

```swift
@backDeployed(before: macOS 14.0, iOS 17.0, watchOS 10.0, tvOS 17.0)
nonisolated func preconditionIsolated(_ message: @autoclosure () -> String = String(), file: StaticString = #fileID, line: UInt = #line)
```

## Parameters

- `message`: The message to print if the assertion fails.
- `file`: The file name to print if the assertion fails. The default is where this method was called.
- `line`: The line number to print if the assertion fails The default is where this method was called.

## Discussion

This function’s effect varies depending on the build flag used:

- In playgrounds and `-Onone` builds (the default for Xcode’s Debug configuration), stops program execution in a debuggable state after printing `message`.
- In `-O` builds (the default for Xcode’s Release configuration), stops program execution.

> **Note**

> Because this check is performed against the actor’s serial executor, if another actor uses the same serial executor–by using that actor’s serial executor as its own [unownedExecutor](unownedexecutor.md)–this check will succeed.  From a concurrency safety perspective, the serial executor guarantees mutual exclusion of those two actors.
