## Declaration

```swift
var onTermination: (@Sendable (AsyncStream<Element>.Continuation.Termination) -> Void)? { get nonmutating set }
```

## Discussion

If an `onTermination` callback is set, using task cancellation to terminate iteration of an `AsyncStream` results in a call to this callback.

Canceling an active iteration invokes the `onTermination` callback first, then resumes by yielding `nil`. This means that you can perform needed cleanup in the cancellation handler. After reaching a terminal state as a result of cancellation, the `AsyncStream` sets the callback to `nil`.

> **Note**

> Because the system might call the `onTermination` callback as part of task cancellation, it’s subject to the same considerations for avoiding deadlock as outlined in the documentation for [withTaskCancellationHandler(operation:onCancel:)](../../withtaskcancellationhandler%28operation_oncancel_%29.md).
