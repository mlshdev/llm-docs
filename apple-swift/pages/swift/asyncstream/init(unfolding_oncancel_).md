# init(unfolding:onCancel:)

**Framework:** Swift  
**Kind:** Initializer  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 13.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 6.0+

Constructs an asynchronous stream from a given element-producing closure, with an optional closure to handle cancellation.

## Declaration

```swift
@preconcurrency init(unfolding produce: @escaping @Sendable () async -> Element?, onCancel: (@Sendable () -> Void)? = nil)
```

## Parameters

- `produce`: A closure that asynchronously produces elements for the stream.
- `onCancel`: A closure to execute when canceling the stream’s task.

## Discussion

Use this convenience initializer when you have an asynchronous function that can produce elements for the stream, and don’t want to invoke a continuation manually. This initializer “unfolds” your closure into an asynchronous stream. The created stream handles conformance to the `AsyncSequence` protocol automatically, including termination (either by cancellation or by returning `nil` from the closure to finish iteration).

The following example shows an `AsyncStream` created with this initializer that produces random numbers on a one-second interval. This example uses the Swift multiple trailing closure syntax, which omits the `unfolding` parameter label.

```swift
let stream = AsyncStream<Int> {
    await Task.sleep(1 * 1_000_000_000)
    return Int.random(in: 1...10)
} onCancel: { @Sendable () in print("Canceled.") }

// Call point:
for await random in stream {
    print(random)
}
```

> **Note**

> Because the system might call the `onCancel` callback as part of task cancellation, it’s subject to the same considerations for avoiding deadlock as outlined in the documentation for [withTaskCancellationHandler(operation:onCancel:)](../withtaskcancellationhandler%28operation_oncancel_%29.md).
