# initializeMemory(as:to:)

**Framework:** Swift  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ · iPadOS 8.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.10+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

Initializes the memory referenced by this pointer with the given value, binds the memory to the value’s type, and returns a typed pointer to the initialized memory.

## Declaration

```swift
@discardableResult func initializeMemory<T>(as type: T.Type, to value: consuming T) -> UnsafeMutablePointer<T> where T : ~Copyable
```

## Parameters

- `type`: The type to which this memory will be bound.
- `value`: The value used to initialize this memory.

## Return Value

A typed pointer to the memory referenced by this raw pointer.

## Discussion

The memory referenced by this pointer must be uninitialized or initialized to a trivial type, and must be properly aligned for accessing `T`.

The following example allocates raw memory for one instance of `UInt`, and then uses the `initializeMemory(as:to:)` method to initialize the allocated memory.

```swift
let bytePointer = UnsafeMutableRawPointer.allocate(
        byteCount: MemoryLayout<UInt>.stride,
        alignment: MemoryLayout<UInt>.alignment)
let int8Pointer = bytePointer.initializeMemory(as: UInt.self, to: 0)

// After using 'int8Pointer':
int8Pointer.deallocate()
```

After calling this method on a raw pointer `p`, the region starting at `self` and continuing up to `p + MemoryLayout<T>.stride` is bound to type `T` and initialized. If `T` is a nontrivial type, you must eventually deinitialize the memory in this region to avoid memory leaks.
