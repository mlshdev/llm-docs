# initializeMemory(as:repeating:count:)

**Framework:** Swift  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ · iPadOS 8.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.10+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

Initializes the memory referenced by this pointer with the given value, binds the memory to the value’s type, and returns a typed pointer to the initialized memory.

## Declaration

```swift
@discardableResult func initializeMemory<T>(as type: T.Type, repeating repeatedValue: T, count: Int) -> UnsafeMutablePointer<T>
```

## Parameters

- `type`: The type to bind this memory to.
- `repeatedValue`: The instance to copy into memory.
- `count`: The number of copies of `value` to copy into memory. `count` must not be negative.

## Return Value

A typed pointer to the memory referenced by this raw pointer.

## Discussion

The memory referenced by this pointer must be uninitialized or initialized to a trivial type, and must be properly aligned for accessing `T`.

The following example allocates enough raw memory to hold four instances of `Int8`, and then uses the `initializeMemory(as:repeating:count:)` method to initialize the allocated memory.

```swift
let count = 4
let bytesPointer = UnsafeMutableRawPointer.allocate(
        byteCount: count * MemoryLayout<Int8>.stride,
        alignment: MemoryLayout<Int8>.alignment)
let int8Pointer = bytesPointer.initializeMemory(
        as: Int8.self, repeating: 0, count: count)

// After using 'int8Pointer':
int8Pointer.deallocate()
```

After calling this method on a raw pointer `p`, the region starting at `self` and continuing up to `p + count * MemoryLayout<T>.stride` is bound to type `T` and initialized. If `T` is a nontrivial type, you must eventually deinitialize or move from the values in this region to avoid leaks.
