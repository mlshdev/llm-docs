# init(capacity:initializingWith:)

**Framework:** Swift  
**Kind:** Initializer  
**Availability:** iOS 12.2+ · iPadOS 12.2+ · Mac Catalyst 12.2+ · macOS 10.14.4+ · tvOS 12.2+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 5.2+

Creates an array with the specified capacity, and then calls the given closure with an output span covering the array’s uninitialized memory.

## Declaration

```swift
init<E>(capacity: Int, initializingWith initializer: @_lifetime(span: copy span) (inout OutputSpan<Element>) throws(E) -> Void) throws(E) where E : Error
```

## Parameters

- `capacity`: The number of elements to allocate space for in the new array.
- `initializer`: A closure that initializes the elements of the new array.

  - Parameters:

    - span: An `OutputSpan` covering uninitialized memory with space for the specified number of elements.

## Discussion

Inside the closure, initialize elements by appending to the `OutputSpan`. The `OutputSpan` keeps track of memory’s initialization state, ensuring safety. Its `count` at the end of the closure will become the `count` of the newly-initialized array.

> **Note**

> While the resulting array may have a capacity larger than the requested amount, the `OutputSpan` passed to the closure will cover exactly the number of elements requested.
