Returns a view presenting the elements of the collection in reverse order.

## Declaration

```swift
func reversed() -> ReversedCollection<Self>
```

## Discussion

You can reverse a collection without allocating new space for its elements by calling this `reversed()` method. A `ReversedCollection` instance wraps an underlying collection and provides access to its elements in reverse order. This example prints the characters of a string in reverse order:

```swift
let word = "Backwards"
for char in word.reversed() {
    print(char, terminator: "")
}
// Prints "sdrawkcaB"
```

If you need a reversed collection of the same type, you may be able to use the collection’s sequence-based or collection-based initializer. For example, to get the reversed version of a string, reverse its characters and initialize a new `String` instance from the result.

```swift
let reversedWord = String(word.reversed())
print(reversedWord)
// Prints "sdrawkcaB"
```

### Reordering an Array’s Elements

- [sort()](sort%28%29.md): Conforms when `Self` conforms to `RandomAccessCollection` and `Element` conforms to `Comparable`. Sorts the collection in place.
- [sort(by:)](sort%28by_%29.md): Conforms when `Self` conforms to `RandomAccessCollection`. Sorts the collection in place, using the given predicate as the comparison between elements.
- [sorted()](sorted%28%29.md): Conforms when `Element` conforms to `Comparable`. Returns the elements of the sequence, sorted.
- [sorted(by:)](sorted%28by_%29.md): Returns the elements of the sequence, sorted using the given predicate as the comparison between elements.
- [reverse()](reverse%28%29.md): Conforms when `Self` conforms to `BidirectionalCollection`. Reverses the elements of the collection in place.
- [shuffle()](shuffle%28%29.md): Conforms when `Self` conforms to `RandomAccessCollection`. Shuffles the collection in place.
- [shuffle(using:)](shuffle%28using_%29.md): Conforms when `Self` conforms to `RandomAccessCollection`. Shuffles the collection in place, using the given generator as a source for randomness.
- [shuffled()](shuffled%28%29.md): Returns the elements of the sequence, shuffled.
- [shuffled(using:)](shuffled%28using_%29.md): Returns the elements of the sequence, shuffled using the given generator as a source for randomness.
- [partition(by:)](partition%28by_%29-90po8.md): Reorders the elements of the collection such that all the elements that match the given predicate are after all the elements that don’t match.
- [swapAt(\_:\_:)](swapat%28____%29.md): Exchanges the values at the specified indices of the collection.
