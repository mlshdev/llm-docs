# reverse()

**Framework:** Swift  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ · iPadOS 8.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.10+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

Reverses the elements of the collection in place.

## Declaration

```swift
mutating func reverse()
```

## Discussion

The following example reverses the elements of an array of characters:

```swift
var characters: [Character] = ["C", "a", "f", "é"]
characters.reverse()
print(characters)
// Prints "["é", "f", "a", "C"]"
```

> **Complexity**

> O(*n*), where *n* is the number of elements in the collection.

### Reordering an Array’s Elements

- [sort()](sort%28%29.md): Conforms when `Self` conforms to `RandomAccessCollection` and `Element` conforms to `Comparable`. Sorts the collection in place.
- [sort(by:)](sort%28by_%29.md): Conforms when `Self` conforms to `RandomAccessCollection`. Sorts the collection in place, using the given predicate as the comparison between elements.
- [sorted()](sorted%28%29.md): Conforms when `Element` conforms to `Comparable`. Returns the elements of the sequence, sorted.
- [sorted(by:)](sorted%28by_%29.md): Returns the elements of the sequence, sorted using the given predicate as the comparison between elements.
- [reversed()](reversed%28%29.md): Returns a view presenting the elements of the collection in reverse order.
- [shuffle()](shuffle%28%29.md): Conforms when `Self` conforms to `RandomAccessCollection`. Shuffles the collection in place.
- [shuffle(using:)](shuffle%28using_%29.md): Conforms when `Self` conforms to `RandomAccessCollection`. Shuffles the collection in place, using the given generator as a source for randomness.
- [shuffled()](shuffled%28%29.md): Returns the elements of the sequence, shuffled.
- [shuffled(using:)](shuffled%28using_%29.md): Returns the elements of the sequence, shuffled using the given generator as a source for randomness.
- [partition(by:)](partition%28by_%29-90po8.md): Reorders the elements of the collection such that all the elements that match the given predicate are after all the elements that don’t match.
- [swapAt(\_:\_:)](swapat%28____%29.md): Exchanges the values at the specified indices of the collection.
