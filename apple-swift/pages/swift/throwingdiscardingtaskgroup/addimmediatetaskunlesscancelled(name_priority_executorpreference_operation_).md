# addImmediateTaskUnlessCancelled(name:priority:executorPreference:operation:)

**Framework:** Swift  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 26.0+ · iPadOS 26.0+ · Mac Catalyst 26.0+ · macOS 26.0+ · tvOS 26.0+ · visionOS 26.0+ · watchOS 26.0+

Add a child task to the group and immediately start running it in the context of the calling thread/task.

## Declaration

```swift
mutating func addImmediateTaskUnlessCancelled(name: String? = nil, priority: TaskPriority? = nil, executorPreference taskExecutor: consuming (any TaskExecutor)? = nil, operation: sending @escaping @isolated(any) () async throws -> Void) -> Bool
```

## Parameters

- `name`: Human readable name of this task.
- `priority`: The priority of the operation task. Omit this parameter or pass `nil` to inherit the task group’s base priority.
- `taskExecutor`: The task executor that the child task should be started on and keep using. Explicitly passing `nil` as the executor preference is equivalent to calling the `addImmediateTaskUnlessCancelled` method without a preference, and effectively means to inherit the outer context’s executor preference. You can also pass the [globalConcurrentExecutor](../globalconcurrentexecutor.md) global executor explicitly.
- `operation`: The operation to execute as part of the task group.

## Return Value

`true` if the child task was added to the group; otherwise `false`.

## Discussion

This function *starts* the created task on the calling context. The task will continue executing on the caller’s context until it suspends, and after suspension will resume on the adequate executor. For a nonisolated operation this means running on the global concurrent pool, and on an isolated operation it means the appropriate executor of that isolation context.

As indicated by the lack of `async` on this method, this method does *not* suspend, and instead takes over the calling task’s (thread’s) execution in a synchronous manner.

Other than the execution semantics discussed above, the created task is semantically equivalent to its basic version which can be created using [addTask(priority:operation:)](addtask%28priority_operation_%29.md).
