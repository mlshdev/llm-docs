# LazyDropWhileCollection

**Framework:** Swift  
**Kind:** Type Alias  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ · iPadOS 8.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.10+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

A lazy wrapper that includes the elements of an underlying collection after any initial consecutive elements that satisfy a predicate.

## Declaration

```swift
typealias LazyDropWhileCollection<T> = LazyDropWhileSequence<T> where T : Collection
```

## Discussion

> **Note**

> The performance of accessing `startIndex`, `first`, or any methods that depend on `startIndex` depends on how many elements satisfy the predicate at the start of the collection, and may not offer the usual performance given by the `Collection` protocol. Be aware, therefore, that general operations on lazy collections may not have the documented complexity.

### Lazy Wrappers

- [LazySequence](lazysequence.md): A sequence containing the same elements as a `Base` sequence, but on which some operations such as `map` and `filter` are implemented lazily.
- [LazyMapSequence](lazymapsequence.md): A `Sequence` whose elements consist of those in a `Base` `Sequence` passed through a transform function returning `Element`. These elements are computed lazily, each time they’re read, by calling the transform function on a base element.
- [LazyFilterSequence](lazyfiltersequence.md): A sequence whose elements consist of the elements of some base sequence that also satisfy a given predicate.
- [LazyPrefixWhileSequence](lazyprefixwhilesequence.md): A sequence whose elements consist of the initial consecutive elements of some base sequence that satisfy a given predicate.
- [LazyDropWhileSequence](lazydropwhilesequence.md): A sequence whose elements consist of the elements that follow the initial consecutive elements of some base sequence that satisfy a given predicate.
- [LazyCollection](lazycollection.md): A collection containing the same elements as a `Base` collection, but on which some operations such as `map` and `filter` are implemented lazily.
- [LazyFilterCollection](lazyfiltercollection.md): A lazy `Collection` wrapper that includes the elements of an underlying collection that satisfy a predicate.
- [LazyMapCollection](lazymapcollection.md): A `Collection` whose elements consist of those in a `Base` `Collection` passed through a transform function returning `Element`. These elements are computed lazily, each time they’re read, by calling the transform function on a base element.
- [LazyPrefixWhileCollection](lazyprefixwhilecollection.md): A lazy collection wrapper that includes the initial consecutive elements of an underlying collection that satisfy a predicate.
