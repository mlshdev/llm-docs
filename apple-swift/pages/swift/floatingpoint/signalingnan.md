## Discussion

The default IEEE 754 behavior of operations involving a signaling NaN is to raise the Invalid flag in the floating-point environment and return a quiet NaN.

Operations on types conforming to the `FloatingPoint` protocol should support this behavior, but they might also support other options. For example, it would be reasonable to implement alternative operations in which operating on a signaling NaN triggers a runtime error or results in a diagnostic for debugging purposes. Types that implement alternative behaviors for a signaling NaN must document the departure.

Other than these signaling operations, a signaling NaN behaves in the same manner as a quiet NaN.
