### Finding Elements

- [contains(where:)](contains%28where_%29.md): Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the sequence contains an element that satisfies the given predicate.
- [allSatisfy(\_:)](allsatisfy%28__%29.md): Returns a Boolean value indicating whether every element of a sequence satisfies a given predicate.
- [first(where:)](first%28where_%29.md): Returns the first element of the sequence that satisfies the given predicate.
- [firstIndex(of:)](firstindex%28of_%29.md): Conforms when `Element` conforms to `Hashable`. Returns the index of the given element in the set, or `nil` if the element is not a member of the set.
- [firstIndex(where:)](firstindex%28where_%29.md): Returns the first index in which an element of the collection satisfies the given predicate.
- [index(of:)](index%28of_%29.md): Deprecated. Conforms when `Element` conforms to `Equatable`. Returns the first index where the specified value appears in the collection.
- [min()](min%28%29.md): Conforms when `Element` conforms to `Comparable`. Returns the minimum element in the sequence.
- [min(by:)](min%28by_%29.md): Returns the minimum element in the sequence, using the given predicate as the comparison between elements.
- [max()](max%28%29.md): Conforms when `Element` conforms to `Comparable`. Returns the maximum element in the sequence.
- [max(by:)](max%28by_%29.md): Returns the maximum element in the sequence, using the given predicate as the comparison between elements.
