## Discussion

You can sort any sequence of elements that conform to the `Comparable` protocol by calling this method. Elements are sorted in ascending order.

Here’s an example of sorting a list of students’ names. Strings in Swift conform to the `Comparable` protocol, so the names are sorted in ascending order according to the less-than operator (`<`).

```swift
let students: Set = ["Kofi", "Abena", "Peter", "Kweku", "Akosua"]
let sortedStudents = students.sorted()
print(sortedStudents)
// Prints "["Abena", "Akosua", "Kofi", "Kweku", "Peter"]"
```

To sort the elements of your sequence in descending order, pass the greater-than operator (`>`) to the `sorted(by:)` method.

```swift
let descendingStudents = students.sorted(by: >)
print(descendingStudents)
// Prints "["Peter", "Kweku", "Kofi", "Akosua", "Abena"]"
```

The sorting algorithm is guaranteed to be stable. A stable sort preserves the relative order of elements that compare as equal.

> O(*n* log *n*), where *n* is the length of the sequence.
