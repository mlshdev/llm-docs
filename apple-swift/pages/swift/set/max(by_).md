# max(by:)

**Framework:** Swift  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 8.0+ · iPadOS 8.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.10+ · tvOS 9.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 2.0+

Returns the maximum element in the sequence, using the given predicate as the comparison between elements.

## Declaration

```swift
@warn_unqualified_access func max(by areInIncreasingOrder: (Self.Element, Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.Element?
```

## Parameters

- `areInIncreasingOrder`: A predicate that returns `true` if its first argument should be ordered before its second argument; otherwise, `false`.

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

The sequence’s maximum element if the sequence is not empty; otherwise, `nil`.

<a id="discussion"></a>

## Discussion

The predicate must be a *strict weak ordering* over the elements. That is, for any elements `a`, `b`, and `c`, the following conditions must hold:

- `areInIncreasingOrder(a, a)` is always `false`. (Irreflexivity)
- If `areInIncreasingOrder(a, b)` and `areInIncreasingOrder(b, c)` are both `true`, then `areInIncreasingOrder(a, c)` is also `true`. (Transitive comparability)
- Two elements are *incomparable* if neither is ordered before the other according to the predicate. If `a` and `b` are incomparable, and `b` and `c` are incomparable, then `a` and `c` are also incomparable. (Transitive incomparability)

This example shows how to use the `max(by:)` method on a dictionary to find the key-value pair with the highest value.

```swift
let hues = ["Heliotrope": 296, "Coral": 16, "Aquamarine": 156]
let greatestHue = hues.max { a, b in a.value < b.value }
print(greatestHue)
// Prints "Optional((key: "Heliotrope", value: 296))"
```

> **Complexity**

> O(*n*), where *n* is the length of the sequence.
