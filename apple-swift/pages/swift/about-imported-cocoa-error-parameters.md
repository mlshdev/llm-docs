# About Imported Cocoa Error Parameters

**Framework:** Swift  
**Kind:** Article

Learn how Cocoa error parameters are converted to Swift throwing methods.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

In Cocoa, methods that produce errors take an [NSError](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nserror) pointer parameter as their last parameter, which populates its argument with an [NSError](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nserror) object if an error occurs. Swift automatically translates Objective-C methods that produce errors into methods that throw an error according to Swift’s native error handling functionality.

### Understand How Error Parameters Are Imported

Swift examines Objective-C method declarations and translates them into Swift throwing methods, with shorter names when possible.

For example, consider the [removeItem(at:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/filemanager/removeitem%28at:%29) method from [FileManager](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/filemanager). In Objective-C, it’s declared like this:

```occ
- (BOOL)removeItemAtURL:(NSURL *)URL
                  error:(NSError **)error;
```

In Swift, it’s imported like this:

```swift
func removeItem(at: URL) throws
```

Notice that the [removeItem(at:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/filemanager/removeitem%28at:%29) method is imported by Swift with a `Void` return type, no error parameter, and a `throws` declaration.

If the last non-block parameter of an Objective-C method is of type `NSError **`, Swift replaces it with the throws keyword, to indicate that the method can throw an error. If the Objective-C method’s error parameter is also its first parameter, Swift attempts to simplify the method name further, by removing the `WithError` or `AndReturnError` suffix, if present, from the first part of the selector. If another method is declared with the resulting selector, the method name is not changed.

If an error producing Objective-C method returns a [BOOL](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/bool) value to indicate the success or failure of a method call, Swift changes the return type of the function to `Void`. Similarly, if an error producing Objective-C method returns a `nil` value to indicate the failure of a method call, Swift changes the return type of the function to a nonoptional type.

Otherwise, if no convention can be inferred, the method is left intact.

> **Note**

> You use the `NS_SWIFT_NOTHROW` macro on Objective-C method declarations that produce an [NSError](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nserror) to prevent it from being imported by Swift as a method that throws.
