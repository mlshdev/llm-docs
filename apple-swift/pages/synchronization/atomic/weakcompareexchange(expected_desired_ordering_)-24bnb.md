# weakCompareExchange(expected:desired:ordering:)

**Framework:** Synchronization  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 18.0+ · iPadOS 18.0+ · Mac Catalyst 18.0+ · macOS 15.0+ · tvOS 18.0+ · visionOS 2.0+ · watchOS 11.0+

Perform an atomic weak compare and exchange operation on the current value, applying the memory ordering. This compare-exchange variant is allowed to spuriously fail; it is designed to be called in a loop until it indicates a successful exchange has happened.

## Declaration

```swift
func weakCompareExchange(expected: consuming Value, desired: consuming Value, ordering: AtomicUpdateOrdering) -> (exchanged: Bool, original: Value)
```

## Parameters

- `expected`: The expected current value.
- `desired`: The desired new value.
- `ordering`: The memory ordering to apply on this operation.

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

A tuple `(exchanged, original)`, where `exchanged` is true if the exchange was successful, and `original` is the original value.

## Discussion

This operation performs the following algorithm as a single atomic transaction:

```swift
atomic(self) { currentValue in
  let original = currentValue
  guard original == expected else { return (false, original) }
  currentValue = desired
  return (true, original)
}
```

> **Note**

> The weakCompareExchange form may sometimes return false even when the original and expected values are equal. (Such failures may happen when some transient condition prevents the underlying operation from succeeding – such as an incoming interrupt during a load-link/store-conditional instruction sequence.) This variant is designed to be called in a loop that only exits when the exchange is successful; in such loops, using weakCompareExchange may lead to a performance improvement by eliminating a nested loop in the regular, “strong”, compareExchange variants.
