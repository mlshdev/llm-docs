# AtomicLoadOrdering

**Framework:** Synchronization  
**Kind:** Structure  
**Availability:** iOS 18.0+ · iPadOS 18.0+ · Mac Catalyst 18.0+ · macOS 15.0+ · tvOS 18.0+ · visionOS 2.0+ · watchOS 11.0+

Specifies the memory ordering semantics of an atomic load operation.

## Declaration

```swift
@frozen struct AtomicLoadOrdering
```

## Topics

### Type Properties

- [acquiring](atomicloadordering/acquiring.md): An acquiring load synchronizes with a releasing operation whose value its reads. It ensures that the releasing and acquiring threads agree that all subsequent variable accesses on the acquiring thread happen after the atomic operation itself.
- [relaxed](atomicloadordering/relaxed.md): Guarantees the atomicity of the specific operation on which it is applied, but imposes no ordering constraints on any other variable accesses.
- [sequentiallyConsistent](atomicloadordering/sequentiallyconsistent.md): A sequentially consistent load performs an acquiring load and also guarantees that it and all other sequentially consistent atomic operations (loads, stores, updates) appear to be executed in a single, total sequential ordering.
