## Discussion

By default, SwiftUI assumes that your document reads and writes the same set of content types. Only define this property if you need to indicate a different set of types for writing files. Otherwise, the default implementation of this property returns the list that you specify in your implementation of [readableContentTypes](readablecontenttypes.md).
