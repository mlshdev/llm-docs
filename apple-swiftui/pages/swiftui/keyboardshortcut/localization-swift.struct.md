## Declaration

## Overview

A shortcut’s `key` that is defined on an US-English keyboard layout might not be reachable on international layouts. For example the shortcut `⌘[` works well for the US layout but is hard to reach for German users. On the German keyboard layout, pressing `⌥5` will produce `[`, which causes the shortcut to become `⌥⌘5`. If configured, which is the default behavior, automatic shortcut remapping will convert it to `⌘Ö`.

In addition to that, some keyboard shortcuts carry information about directionality. Right-aligning a block of text or seeking forward in context of music playback are such examples. These kinds of shortcuts benefit from the option [withoutMirroring](localization-swift.struct/withoutmirroring.md) to tell the system that they won’t be flipped when running in a right-to-left context.

## Topics

### Getting localization strategies

- [automatic](localization-swift.struct/automatic.md): Remap shortcuts to their international counterparts, mirrored for right-to-left usage if appropriate.
- [custom](localization-swift.struct/custom.md): Don’t use automatic shortcut remapping.
- [withoutMirroring](localization-swift.struct/withoutmirroring.md): Don’t mirror shortcuts.
