# projectedValue

**Framework:** SwiftUI  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** watchOS 7.0+ (deprecated in 9.2)

A projection of the observed object that provides bindings to its properties.

> Use WKApplicationDelegateAdaptor with a WKApplicationDelegate instead.

## Declaration

```swift
@MainActor @preconcurrency var projectedValue: ObservedObject<DelegateType>.Wrapper { get }
```

## Discussion

Use the projected value to get a binding to a value that the delegate publishes. Access the projected value by prefixing the name of the delegate instance with a dollar sign (`$`). For example, you might publish a Boolean value in your extension delegate:

```swift
class MyExtensionDelegate: NSObject, WKExtensionDelegate, ObservableObject {
    @Published var isEnabled = false

    // ...
}
```

If you declare the delegate in your [App](../app.md) using the [WKExtensionDelegateAdaptor](../wkextensiondelegateadaptor.md) property wrapper, you can get the delegate that SwiftUI instantiates from the environment and access a binding to its published values from any view in your extension:

```swift
struct MyView: View {
    @EnvironmentObject private var extensionDelegate: MyExtensionDelegate

    var body: some View {
        Toggle("Enabled", isOn: $extensionDelegate.isEnabled)
    }
}
```
