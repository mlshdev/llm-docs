## Overview

Unlike [LazyVStack](lazyvstack.md), which only renders the views when your app needs to display them, a `VStack` renders the views all at once, regardless of whether they are on- or offscreen. Use the regular `VStack` when you have a small number of subviews or don’t want the delayed rendering behavior of the “lazy” version.

The following example shows a simple vertical stack of 10 text views:

```swift
var body: some View {
    VStack(
        alignment: .leading,
        spacing: 10
    ) {
        ForEach(
            1...10,
            id: \.self
        ) {
            Text("Item \($0)")
        }
    }
}
```

> **Note**

> If you need a vertical stack that conforms to the [Layout](layout.md) protocol, like when you want to create a conditional layout using [AnyLayout](anylayout.md), use [VStackLayout](vstacklayout.md) instead.
