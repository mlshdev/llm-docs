# init(for:content:)

**Framework:** SwiftUI  
**Kind:** Initializer  
**Availability:** iOS 16.0+ · iPadOS 16.0+ · Mac Catalyst 16.0+ · macOS 13.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

Creates a data-presenting window group.

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated init<D, C>(for type: D.Type, @ContentBuilder content: @escaping (Binding<D?>) -> C) where Content == PresentedWindowContent<D, C>, D : Decodable, D : Encodable, D : Hashable, C : View
```

## Parameters

- `type`: The type of presented data this window group accepts.
- `content`: A closure that creates the content for each instance of the group. The closure receives a binding to the value that you pass into the [openWindow](../environmentvalues/openwindow.md) action when you open the window. SwiftUI automatically persists and restores the value of this binding as part of the state restoration process.

## Discussion

The window group uses the given view as a template to form the content of each window in the group.

SwiftUI creates a window from the group when you present a value of the specified type using the [openWindow](../environmentvalues/openwindow.md) action.
