## Overview

The stack is “lazy,” in that the stack view doesn’t create items until it needs to render them onscreen.

In the following example, a [ScrollView](scrollview.md) contains a `LazyVStack` that consists of a vertical row of text views. The stack aligns to the leading edge of the scroll view, and uses default spacing between the text views.

```swift
ScrollView {
    LazyVStack(alignment: .leading) {
        ForEach(1...100, id: \.self) {
            Text("Row \($0)")
        }
    }
}
```
