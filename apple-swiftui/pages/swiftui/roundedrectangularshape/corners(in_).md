# corners(in:)

**Framework:** SwiftUI  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 26.0+ · iPadOS 26.0+ · Mac Catalyst 26.0+ · macOS 26.0+ · tvOS 26.0+ · visionOS 26.0+ · watchOS 26.0+

Resolved corners given a size. If the corner style of a shape is size-dependent, read the provided size and return values accordingly. This function could be called with a nil size when the size hasn’t been determined. In that case, return the best approximated value. For example, for a capsule shape, its corner radius is determined by the size. If size is not available, return `.fixed(.infinity)` to indicate that the corner should be as round as it could be.

## Declaration

```swift
func corners(in size: CGSize?) -> Self.Corners?
```
