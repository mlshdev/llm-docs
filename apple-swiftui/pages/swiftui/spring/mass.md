# mass

**Framework:** SwiftUI  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 17.0+ · iPadOS 17.0+ · Mac Catalyst 17.0+ · macOS 14.0+ · tvOS 17.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 10.0+

The mass of the object attached to the end of the spring.

## Declaration

```swift
var mass: Double { get }
```

## Discussion

The default mass is 1. Increasing this value will increase the spring’s effect: the attached object will be subject to more oscillations and greater overshoot, resulting in an increased settling duration. Decreasing the mass will reduce the spring effect: there will be fewer oscillations and a reduced overshoot, resulting in a decreased settling duration.

- [damping](damping.md): Defines how the spring’s motion should be damped due to the forces of friction.
- [dampingRatio](dampingratio.md): The amount of drag applied, as a fraction of the amount needed to produce critical damping.
- [duration](duration.md): The perceptual duration, which defines the pace of the spring.
