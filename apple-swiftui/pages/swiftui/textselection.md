# TextSelection

**Framework:** SwiftUI  
**Kind:** Structure  
**Availability:** iOS 18.0+ · iPadOS 18.0+ · Mac Catalyst 18.0+ · macOS 15.0+ · tvOS 18.0+ · visionOS 2.0+ · watchOS 11.0+

Represents a selection of text.

## Declaration

```swift
struct TextSelection
```

## Overview

A selection is either an insertion point (e.g. a cursor in the text), a selection over a range of text or on macOS, multiple selections.

This is frequently used to represent selection of text in a `TextField` or `TextEditor`. The following example shows a text editor that leverages text selection to offer live suggestions based on the current selection.

```swift
struct SuggestionTextEditor: View {
    @State var text: String = ""
    @State var selection: TextSelection? = nil

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            TextEditor(text: $text, selection: $selection)
            // A helper view that offers live suggestions based on selection.
            SuggestionsView(
                substrings: getSubstrings(text: text, indices: selection?.indices))
        }
    }

    private func getSubstrings(
        text: String, indices: TextSelection.Indices?
    ) -> [Substring] {
        // Resolve substrings representing the current selection...
    }
}

struct SuggestionsView: View { ... }
```

You can also use the [textSelectionAffinity(\_:)](view/textselectionaffinity%28__%29.md) modifier to specify a selection affinity on the given hierarchy:

```swift
struct SuggestionTextEditor: View {
    @State var text: String = ""
    @State var selection: TextSelection? = nil

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            TextEditor(text: $text, selection: $selection)
            // A helper view that offers live suggestions based on selection.
            SuggestionsView(
                substrings: getSubstrings(text: text, indices: selection?.indices))
        }
        .textSelectionAffinity(.upstream)
    }

    private func getSubstrings(
        text: String, indices: TextSelection.Indices?
    ) -> [Substring] {
        // Resolve substrings representing the current selection...
    }
}

struct SuggestionsView: View { ... }
```

## Topics

### Initializers

- [init(insertionPoint:)](textselection/init%28insertionpoint_%29.md): Create a selection at a given insertion point.
- [init(range:)](textselection/init%28range_%29.md): Create a single selection with a given range.
- [init(ranges:)](textselection/init%28ranges_%29.md): Create multiple selections with a given range-set.

### Instance Properties

- [affinity](textselection/affinity.md): Return the selection affinity of the selection.
- [indices](textselection/indices-swift.property.md): Return the current text selection indices.
- [isInsertion](textselection/isinsertion.md): Return `true` if the selection is an insertion point.

### Enumerations

- [TextSelection.Indices](textselection/indices-swift.enum.md): The indices of the current selection.

### Selecting text

- [textSelection(\_:)](view/textselection%28__%29.md): Controls whether people can select text within this view.
- [TextSelectability](textselectability.md): A type that describes the ability to select text.
- [textSelectionAffinity(\_:)](view/textselectionaffinity%28__%29.md): Sets the direction of a selection or cursor relative to a text character.
- [textSelectionAffinity](environmentvalues/textselectionaffinity.md): A representation of the direction or association of a selection or cursor relative to a text character.
