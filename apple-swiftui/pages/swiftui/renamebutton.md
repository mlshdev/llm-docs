# RenameButton

**Framework:** SwiftUI  
**Kind:** Structure  
**Availability:** iOS 16.0+ · iPadOS 16.0+ · Mac Catalyst 16.0+ · macOS 13.0+ · tvOS 16.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 9.0+

A button that triggers a standard rename action.

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated struct RenameButton<Label> where Label : View
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

A rename button receives its action from the environment. Use the [renameAction(\_:)](view/renameaction%28__%29.md) modifier to set the action. The system disables the button if you don’t define an action.

```swift
struct RowView: View {
    @State private var text = ""
    @FocusState private var isFocused: Bool

    var body: some View {
        TextField(text: $text) {
            Text("Prompt")
        }
        .focused($isFocused)
        .contextMenu {
            RenameButton()
            // ... your own custom actions
        }
        .renameAction { isFocused = true }
    }
}
```

When someone taps the rename button in the context menu, the rename action focuses the text field by setting the `isFocused` property to true.

You can use this button inside of a navigation title menu and the navigation title modifier automatically configures the environment with the appropriate rename action.

```swift
ContentView()
    .navigationTitle($contentTitle)
    .toolbarTitleMenu {
        // ... your own custom actions
        RenameButton()
    }
```
