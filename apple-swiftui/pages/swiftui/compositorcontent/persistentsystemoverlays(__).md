## Discussion

Use this modifier to influence the appearance of system overlays in your app. The behavior varies by platform. For an [ImmersiveSpace](../immersivespace.md), it affects the Home indicator.

> **Note**

> You can indicate a preference with this modifier, but the system might or might not be able to honor that preference.

Affected non-transient system views can include, but are not limited to:
