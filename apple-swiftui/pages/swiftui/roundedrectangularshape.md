# RoundedRectangularShape

**Framework:** SwiftUI  
**Kind:** Protocol  
**Availability:** iOS 26.0+ · iPadOS 26.0+ · Mac Catalyst 26.0+ · macOS 26.0+ · tvOS 26.0+ · visionOS 26.0+ · watchOS 26.0+

A protocol of [InsettableShape](insettableshape.md) that describes a rounded rectangular shape.

## Declaration

```swift
protocol RoundedRectangularShape : InsettableShape
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

Conform your [InsettableShape](insettableshape.md) type to [RoundedRectangularShape](roundedrectangularshape.md) when your shape is a rounded rectangular with four corners and you want to expose information about the corners. For example, a custom triangle [Shape](shape.md) is not fit for such conformance, while a custom rectangle [Shape](shape.md) could benefit from providing the implementation, especially when the shape is used as a container shape in [containerShape(\_:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/containershape%28_:%29-3br47) to achieve concentricity.

System shapes like [Rectangle](rectangle.md), [RoundedRectangle](roundedrectangle.md), [UnevenRoundedRectangle](unevenroundedrectangle.md), [Capsule](capsule.md), and [Circle](circle.md) already provide default implementation for this protocol.

## Topics

### Instance Methods

- [corners(in:)](roundedrectangularshape/corners%28in_%29.md): Resolved corners given a size. If the corner style of a shape is size-dependent, read the provided size and return values accordingly. This function could be called with a nil size when the size hasn’t been determined. In that case, return the best approximated value. For example, for a capsule shape, its corner radius is determined by the size. If size is not available, return `.fixed(.infinity)` to indicate that the corner should be as round as it could be.
