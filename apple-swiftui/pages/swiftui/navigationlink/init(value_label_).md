# init(value:label:)

**Framework:** SwiftUI  
**Kind:** Initializer  
**Availability:** iOS 16.0+ · iPadOS 16.0+ · Mac Catalyst 16.0+ · macOS 13.0+ · tvOS 16.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 9.0+

Creates a navigation link that presents the view corresponding to a codable value.

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated init<P>(value: P?, @ContentBuilder label: () -> Label) where P : Decodable, P : Encodable, P : Hashable
```

## Parameters

- `value`: An optional value to present. When the user selects the link, SwiftUI stores a copy of the value. Pass a `nil` value to disable the link.
- `label`: A label that describes the view that this link presents.

## Discussion

When someone activates the navigation link that this initializer creates, SwiftUI looks for a nearby [navigationDestination(for:destination:)](../view/navigationdestination%28for_destination_%29.md) view modifier with a `data` input parameter that matches the type of this initializer’s `value` input, with one of the following outcomes:

- If SwiftUI finds a matching modifier within the view hierarchy of an enclosing [NavigationStack](../navigationstack.md), it pushes the modifier’s corresponding `destination` view onto the stack.
- If SwiftUI finds a matching modifier in the view hierarchy of a stack that’s in a later column of a [NavigationSplitView](../navigationsplitview.md), it puts the modifier’s destination view as the first and only item onto the stack while preserving the stack’s root view.
- If there’s no matching modifier, but the link appears in a [List](../list.md) with selection inside a leading column of a navigation split view, the link updates the selection, which might affect the appearance of a trailing view. For an example of this, see [NavigationLink](../navigationlink.md).
- In other cases, the link doesn’t do anything.

Because this initializer takes a value that conforms to the [Codable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/codable) protocol, you ensure that a [NavigationPath](../navigationpath.md) that includes this link can produce a non-`nil` value for its [codable](../navigationpath/codable.md) property. This helps to make the path serializable.

### Presenting a value

- [init(\_:value:)](init%28__value_%29.md): Conforms when `Label` conforms to `View` and `Destination` is `Never`. Creates a navigation link that presents the view corresponding to a codable value, with a text label that the link generates from a localized string resource.
