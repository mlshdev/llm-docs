## Discussion

You can read this value by creating a property with the [Environment](../environment.md) property wrapper and using it inside the action closure of the [onPencilSqueeze(perform:)](../view/onpencilsqueeze%28perform_%29.md) view modifier as an indication of what to do when the user squeezes their Apple Pencil:

```swift
@Environment(\.preferredPencilSqueezeAction) private var preferredAction

var body: some View {
    MyDrawingCanvas()
        .onPencilSqueeze { phase in
            switch (phase, preferredAction) {
                ...
            }
        }
}
```

In macOS, this value cannot be changed by users and is always set to [showContextualPalette](../pencilpreferredaction/showcontextualpalette.md).
