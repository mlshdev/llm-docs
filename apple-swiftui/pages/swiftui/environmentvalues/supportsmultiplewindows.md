# supportsMultipleWindows

**Framework:** SwiftUI  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 16.0+ · iPadOS 16.0+ · Mac Catalyst 16.0+ · macOS 13.0+ · tvOS 16.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 9.0+

A Boolean value that indicates whether the current platform supports opening multiple windows.

## Declaration

```swift
var supportsMultipleWindows: Bool { get }
```

<a id="discussion"></a>

## Discussion

Read this property from the environment to determine if your app can use the [openWindow](openwindow.md) action to open new windows:

```swift
struct NewMailViewerButton: View {
    @Environment(\.supportsMultipleWindows) private var supportsMultipleWindows
    @Environment(\.openWindow) private var openWindow

    var body: some View {
        Button("Open New Window") {
            openWindow(id: "mail-viewer")
        }
        .disabled(!supportsMultipleWindows)
    }
}
```

The reported value depends on both the platform and how you configure your app:

- In macOS, this property returns `true` for any app that uses the SwiftUI app lifecycle.
- In iPadOS, this property returns `true` for any app that uses the SwiftUI app lifecycle and has the Information Property List key [UIApplicationSupportsMultipleScenes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information-property-list/uiapplicationscenemanifest/uiapplicationsupportsmultiplescenes) set to `true`.
- For all other platforms and configurations, the value returns `false`.

If the value is false and you try to open a window, SwiftUI ignores the action and logs a runtime error.
