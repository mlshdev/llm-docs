# isPresented

**Framework:** SwiftUI  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 15.0+ · iPadOS 15.0+ · Mac Catalyst 15.0+ · macOS 12.0+ · tvOS 15.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 8.0+

A Boolean value that indicates whether the view associated with this environment is currently presented.

## Declaration

```swift
var isPresented: Bool { get }
```

<a id="discussion"></a>

## Discussion

You can read this value like any of the other [EnvironmentValues](../environmentvalues.md) by creating a property with the [Environment](../environment.md) property wrapper:

```swift
@Environment(\.isPresented) private var isPresented
```

Read the value inside a view if you need to know when SwiftUI presents that view. For example, you can take an action when SwiftUI presents a view by using the [onChange(of:initial:\_:)](../view/onchange%28of_initial___%29.md) modifier:

```swift
.onChange(of: isPresented) { _, isPresented in
    if isPresented {
        // Do something when first presented.
    }
}
```

This behaves differently than [onAppear(perform:)](../view/onappear%28perform_%29.md), which SwiftUI can call more than once for a given presentation, like when you navigate back to a view that’s already in the navigation hierarchy.

To dismiss the currently presented view, use [dismiss](dismiss.md).
