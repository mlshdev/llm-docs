# systemPrefersReducedResourceUsage

**Framework:** SwiftUI  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 27.0+ · iPadOS 27.0+ · Mac Catalyst 27.0+ · macOS 27.0+ · tvOS 27.0+ · visionOS 27.0+ · watchOS 27.0+

A boolean value indicating whether the system would prefer the app to reduce its overall resource usage.

## Declaration

```swift
var systemPrefersReducedResourceUsage: Bool { get set }
```

## Discussion

When this value is `true`, the system has entered a state where it would prefer apps to scale back resource-intensive work. The default value is `false`.

Use this to avoid or reduce expensive work. For example:

- Gate or simplify resource-intensive UI, such as 3D or AR viewers, advanced camera modes, or live effects.
- Choose lighter-weight paths, such as lower-resolution assets or fewer simultaneous operations.
- Defer or shrink non-essential background work, such as prefetching or precomputation.

Avoid performing or scheduling expensive work in response to changes in this property, as this could worsen resource usage.

> **Tip**

> For in-memory caching, consider using `NSCache` with `NSPurgeableData`, which automatically evicts entries under system memory pressure. Use `systemPrefersReducedResourceUsage` for higher-level decisions that `NSCache` cannot make on its own.

When accessed outside in an `App` or `Scene` struct, this defaults to an app-wide aggregate value based on all scenes.
