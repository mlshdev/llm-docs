# reservedRegions(kind:options:layoutDirectionBehavior:)

**Framework:** SwiftUI  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 27.1+ beta · iPadOS 27.1+ beta

Returns an array of reserved regions that match the selection options you specify.

## Declaration

```swift
func reservedRegions(kind: ReservedRegion.Kind, options: ReservedRegion.QueryOptions = [], layoutDirectionBehavior: LayoutDirectionBehavior = .mirrors) -> [ReservedRegion]
```

## Discussion

A reserved region indicates an area within a view’s coordinate space that an entity, such as the device hardware, reserves. Arrange the view’s content to account for this region. Each region describes a frame, margins, active state, and an identifier.

There are two categories of reserved regions:

- **[occlusion](../reservedregion/kind-swift.struct/occlusion.md)**: An area where an element, such as the Dynamic Island, a camera, or window controls, occludes content.
- **[division](../reservedregion/kind-swift.struct/division.md)**: An area where content splits into separate regions, such as at the fold of a hinge.

Read reserved regions using the [reservedRegions(kind:options:layoutDirectionBehavior:)](reservedregions%28kind_options_layoutdirectionbehavior_%29.md) method, which returns all of the reserved regions that currently intersect your view regardless of whether they are currently active.

In the example below, a custom [Layout](../layout.md) uses the reserved regions from a [GeometryProxy](../geometryproxy.md) instance to handle positioning its subviews away from any regions that intersect it.

```swift
GeometryReader { proxy in
    RegionAvoidingLayout(
        regions: proxy.reservedRegions(kind: .occlusion)
    ) {
        ForEach(items) { item in
            ItemView(item)
        }
    }
}    
```

When you manually position your content to incorporate reserved regions, take care to consider right-to-left layout directions. Reserved regions are typically in a fixed coordinate space; the absolute location of the camera of a device doesn’t flip depending on a person’s preferred language. By default, the system mirrors the geometry of these regions automatically before it provides them to SwiftUI APIs.

For example, a [Layout](../layout.md) automatically flips the geometry of the subviews you place. By mirroring the geometry of the reserved regions, your layout doesn’t need to account for the layout direction when determining whether a subview intersects the region.

There may be cases when you need to make more manual adjustments for the frames of reserved regions for right-to-left layout directions. In these cases, you can provide the [LayoutDirectionBehavior.fixed](../layoutdirectionbehavior/fixed.md) value to the method and the system doesn’t mirror the frames of the regions.
