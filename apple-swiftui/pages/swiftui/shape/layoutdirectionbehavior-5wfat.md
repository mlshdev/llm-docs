## Discussion

If the layoutDirectionBehavior for a Shape is one that mirrors, the shape’s path will be mirrored horizontally when in the specified layout direction. When mirrored, the individual points of the path will be transformed.

Defaults to `.mirrors` when deploying on iOS 17.0, macOS 14.0, tvOS 17.0, watchOS 10.0 and later, and to `.fixed` if not. To mirror a path when deploying to earlier releases, either use `View.flipsForRightToLeftLayoutDirection` for a filled or stroked shape or conditionally mirror the points in the path of the shape.
