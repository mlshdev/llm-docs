# offset(x:y:)

**Framework:** SwiftUI  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 13.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 6.0+

Changes the relative position of this shape using the specified point.

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated func offset(x: CGFloat = 0, y: CGFloat = 0) -> OffsetShape<Self>
```

## Parameters

- `x`: The horizontal amount, in points, by which you offset the shape. Negative numbers are to the left and positive numbers are to the right.
- `y`: The vertical amount, in points, by which you offset the shape. Negative numbers are up and positive numbers are down.

## Discussion

The following example renders two circles. It places one circle at its default position. The second circle is outlined with a stroke, positioned on top of the first circle and offset by 100 points to the left and 50 points below.

```swift
Circle()
.overlay(
    Circle()
    .offset(x: -100, y: 50)
    .stroke()
)
```

### Transforming a shape

- [trim(from:to:)](trim%28from_to_%29.md): Trims this shape by a fractional amount based on its representation as a path.
- [transform(\_:)](transform%28__%29.md): Applies an affine transform to this shape.
- [size(\_:)](size%28__%29.md): Returns a new version of self representing the same shape, but that will ask it to create its path from a rect of `size`. This does not affect the layout properties of any views created from the shape (e.g. by filling it).
- [size(\_:anchor:)](size%28__anchor_%29.md): Returns a new version of self representing the same shape, but within a rect of `size` instead of the container size.
- [size(width:height:)](size%28width_height_%29.md): Returns a new version of self representing the same shape, but that will ask it to create its path from a rect of size `(width, height)`. This does not affect the layout properties of any views created from the shape (e.g. by filling it).
- [size(width:height:anchor:)](size%28width_height_anchor_%29.md): Returns a new version of self representing the same shape, but within a rect of `(width, height)` instead of the container size.
- [scale(\_:anchor:)](scale%28__anchor_%29.md): Scales this shape without changing its bounding frame.
- [scale(x:y:anchor:)](scale%28x_y_anchor_%29.md): Scales this shape without changing its bounding frame.
- [rotation(\_:anchor:)](rotation%28__anchor_%29.md): Rotates this shape around an anchor point at the angle you specify.
- [offset(\_:)](offset%28__%29.md): Changes the relative position of this shape using the specified point.
