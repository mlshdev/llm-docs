# App organization

**Framework:** SwiftUI  
**Kind:** API Collection

Define the entry point and top-level structure of your app.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

Describe your app’s structure declaratively, much like you declare a view’s appearance. Create a type that conforms to the [App](app.md) protocol and use it to enumerate the [Scenes](scenes.md) that represent aspects of your app’s user interface.

SwiftUI enables you to write code that works across all of Apple’s platforms. However, it also enables you to tailor your app to the specific capabilities of each platform. For example, if you need to respond to the callbacks that the system traditionally makes on a UIKit, AppKit, or WatchKit app’s delegate, define a delegate object and instantiate it in your app structure using an appropriate delegate adaptor property wrapper, like [UIApplicationDelegateAdaptor](uiapplicationdelegateadaptor.md).

For platform-specific design guidance, see [Getting started](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/getting-started) in the Human Interface Guidelines.

- [UIApplicationDelegateAdaptor](uiapplicationdelegateadaptor.md): A property wrapper type that you use to create a UIKit app delegate.

### Targeting macOS

- [NSApplicationDelegateAdaptor](nsapplicationdelegateadaptor.md): A property wrapper type that you use to create an AppKit app delegate.

### Targeting watchOS

- [WKApplicationDelegateAdaptor](wkapplicationdelegateadaptor.md): A property wrapper that is used in `App` to provide a delegate from WatchKit.
