## Discussion

This phase is the result of a programmatic scroll when using a [ScrollViewReader](../scrollviewreader.md) or [scrollPosition(id:anchor:)](../view/scrollposition%28id_anchor_%29.md) modifier.

SwiftUI provides you a value of this type when using the [onScrollPhaseChange(\_:)](../view/onscrollphasechange%28__%29.md) modifier with a scrollable view like [ScrollView](../scrollview.md) or [List](../list.md).
