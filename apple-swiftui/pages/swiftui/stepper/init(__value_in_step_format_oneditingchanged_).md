# init(\_:value:in:step:format:onEditingChanged:)

**Framework:** SwiftUI  
**Kind:** Initializer  
**Availability:** iOS 16.0+ · iPadOS 16.0+ · Mac Catalyst 16.0+ · macOS 13.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 9.0+

Creates a stepper instance that increments and decrements a binding to a value, by a step size and within a closed range that you provide, displaying its value with an applied format style.

## Declaration

```swift
@export(implementation) nonisolated init<F>(_ titleResource: LocalizedStringResource, value: Binding<F.FormatInput>, in bounds: ClosedRange<F.FormatInput>, step: F.FormatInput.Stride = 1, format: F, onEditingChanged: @escaping (Bool) -> Void = { _ in }) where F : ParseableFormatStyle, F.FormatInput : BinaryFloatingPoint, F.FormatOutput == String
```

## Parameters

- `titleResource`: Text resource for the stepper’s localized title describing the purpose of the stepper.
- `value`: A [Binding](../binding.md) to a value that your provide.
- `bounds`: A closed range that describes the upper and lower bounds permitted by the stepper.
- `step`: The amount to increment or decrement `value` each time the user clicks or taps the stepper’s increment or decrement button, respectively. Defaults to `1`.
- `format`: A format style of type `F` to use when converting between the string the user edits and the underlying value of type `F.FormatInput`. If `format` can’t perform the conversion, the stepper leaves `value` unchanged. If the user stops editing the text in an invalid state, the stepper updates the text to the last known valid value.
- `onEditingChanged`: A closure that’s called when editing begins and ends. For example, on iOS, the user may touch and hold the increment or decrement buttons on a `Stepper` which causes the execution of the `onEditingChanged` closure at the start and end of the gesture.

## Discussion

Use `Stepper(_:value:in:step:format:onEditingChanged:)` to create a stepper that increments or decrements a value within a specific range of values by a specific step size, while displaying the current value. In the example below, a stepper increments or decrements a binding to value over a range of `1...50` by `5` each time the user clicks or taps the stepper’s increment or decrement buttons:

```swift
struct StepperView: View {
    @State private var value = 0.0
    private let step = 5.0
    private let range = 1.0...50.0

    var body: some View {
        Stepper("Stepping by \(step) in \(range.description)",
            value: $value,
            in: range,
            step: step,
            format: .number
        )
        .padding()
    }
}
```
