# addFilter(\_:options:)

**Framework:** SwiftUI  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 15.0+ · iPadOS 15.0+ · Mac Catalyst 15.0+ · macOS 12.0+ · tvOS 15.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 8.0+

Adds a filter that applies to subsequent drawing operations.

## Declaration

```swift
mutating func addFilter(_ filter: GraphicsContext.Filter, options: GraphicsContext.FilterOptions = FilterOptions())
```

## Parameters

- `filter`: A graphics context filter that you create by calling one of the [GraphicsContext.Filter](filter.md) factory methods.
- `options`: A set of options from [GraphicsContext.FilterOptions](filteroptions.md) that you can use to configure filter operations.

## Discussion

To draw with filtering, SwiftUI:

- Rasterizes the drawing operation to an implicit transparency layer without blending, adjusting opacity, or applying any clipping.
- Applies the filter to the layer containing the rasterized image.
- Composites the layer onto the background, using the context’s current blend mode, opacity setting, and clip shapes.

When SwiftUI draws with a filter, the blend mode might apply to regions outside the drawing operation’s intrinsic shape, but inside its clip shape. That might result in unexpected behavior for certain blend modes like [copy](blendmode-swift.struct/copy.md), where the drawing operation completely overwrites the background even if the source alpha is zero.
