## Overview

A scene represents a part of your app’s user interface that has a life cycle that the system manages. An [App](app.md) instance presents the scenes it contains, while each [Scene](scene.md) acts as the root element of a [View](view.md) hierarchy.

The system presents scenes in different ways depending on the type of scene, the platform, and the context. A scene might fill the entire display, part of the display, a window, a tab in a window, or something else. In some cases, your app might also be able to display more than one instance of the scene at a time, like when a user simultaneously opens multiple windows based on a single [WindowGroup](windowgroup.md) declaration in your app. For more information about the primary built-in scene types, see [Windows](windows.md) and [Documents](documents.md).

You configure scenes using modifiers, similar to how you configure views. For example, you can adjust the appearance of the window that contains a scene — if the scene happens to appear in a window — using the [windowStyle(\_:)](scene/windowstyle%28__%29.md) modifier. Similarly, you can add menu commands that become available when the scene is in the foreground on certain platforms using the [commands(content:)](scene/commands%28content_%29.md) modifier.

## Topics

### Monitoring scene life cycle

- [scenePhase](environmentvalues/scenephase.md): The current phase of the scene.
- [ScenePhase](scenephase.md): An indication of a scene’s operational state.

### Managing a settings window

- [Settings](settings.md): A scene that presents an interface for viewing and modifying an app’s settings.
- [SettingsLink](settingslink.md): A view that opens the Settings scene defined by an app.
- [OpenSettingsAction](opensettingsaction.md): An action that presents the settings scene for an app.
- [openSettings](environmentvalues/opensettings.md): A Settings presentation action stored in a view’s environment.

### Creating a menu bar extra

- [MenuBarExtra](menubarextra.md): A scene that renders itself as a persistent control in the system menu bar.
- [menuBarExtraStyle(\_:)](scene/menubarextrastyle%28__%29.md): Sets the style for menu bar extra created by this scene.
- [MenuBarExtraStyle](menubarextrastyle.md): A specification for the appearance and behavior of a menu bar extra scene.

### Creating watch notifications

- [WKNotificationScene](wknotificationscene.md): A scene which appears in response to receiving the specified category of remote or local notifications.

### Presenting content on an external display

- [sceneAccessory(content:)](view/sceneaccessory%28content_%29.md): Defines any scene accessories associated with `self`.
- [SceneAccessoryContent](sceneaccessorycontent.md): Conforming types represent items which define content for scene accessories.
- [ExternalNonInteractiveAccessory](externalnoninteractiveaccessory.md): A scene accessory that presents non-interactive content on an external display.
