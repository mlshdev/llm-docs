# dithersColor

**Framework:** SwiftUI  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 17.0+ · iPadOS 17.0+ · Mac Catalyst 17.0+ · macOS 14.0+ · tvOS 17.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

For shader functions that return color values, whether the returned color has dither noise added to it, or is simply rounded to the output bit-depth. For shaders generating smooth gradients, dithering is usually necessary to prevent visible banding in the result.

## Declaration

```swift
var dithersColor: Bool { get set }
```
