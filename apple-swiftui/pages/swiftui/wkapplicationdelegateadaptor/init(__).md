## Discussion

The framework will initialize the provided delegate and manage its lifetime, calling out to it when appropriate after performing its own work.

> **Note**

> The instantiated delegate will be placed in the Environment and may be accessed by using the `@Environment` property wrapper in the view hierarchy.
