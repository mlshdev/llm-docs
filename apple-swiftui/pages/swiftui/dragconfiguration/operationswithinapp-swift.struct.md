# DragConfiguration.OperationsWithinApp

**Framework:** SwiftUI  
**Kind:** Structure  
**Availability:** iOS 26.0+ · iPadOS 26.0+ · Mac Catalyst 26.0+ · macOS 26.0+ · visionOS 26.0+

Describes the drag operations suggested to destinations within the app.

## Declaration

```swift
struct OperationsWithinApp
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

To create a default configuration, initialize it without parameters.

On iOS, the default behavior is to allow drag-to-copy within the application. On macOS, the default configuration is to support drag-to-copy to destinations both within the application and to other apps.

In addition to `copy`, add `move` operation support by specifying that in the initializer:

```swift
struct DraggableBookView: View {
    var id: UUID

    var body: some View {
        BookView()
            .draggable(Book(id: id))
            .dragConfiguration(makeConfiguration())
    }

    func makeConfiguration() -> DragConfiguration {
        let operations = OperationsWithinApp(allowMove: true)
        return DragConfiguration(operationsWithinApp: operations)
    }
}
```

In the example above, an application provides operations that will be suggested to destinations within the app. Drags to other apps will use the default behavior: suggest operation `copy` to drag destinations on macOS, and forbid drags on iOS.

## Topics

### Initializers

- [init(allowCopy:allowMove:allowDelete:)](operationswithinapp-swift.struct/init%28allowcopy_allowmove_allowdelete_%29.md): Creates a value that describes the operations allowed for drags that end within the application.
- [init(allowMove:)](operationswithinapp-swift.struct/init%28allowmove_%29.md): Creates a value that describes the operations allowed for drags that end within the application. Copy operation is always allowed.

### Instance Properties

- [allowAlias](operationswithinapp-swift.struct/allowalias.md): A Boolean value indicating if the drag operation supports creating aliases to the dropped items.
