# ObservedObject

**Framework:** SwiftUI  
**Kind:** Structure  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 13.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 6.0+

A property wrapper type that subscribes to an observable object and invalidates a view whenever the observable object changes.

## Declaration

```swift
@MainActor @propertyWrapper @preconcurrency @frozen struct ObservedObject<ObjectType> where ObjectType : ObservableObject
```

## Overview

Add the `@ObservedObject` attribute to a parameter of a SwiftUI [View](view.md) when the input is an [ObservableObject](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/observableobject) and you want the view to update when the object’s published properties change. You typically do this to pass a [StateObject](stateobject.md) into a subview.

The following example defines a data model as an observable object, instantiates the model in a view as a state object, and then passes the instance to a subview as an observed object:

```swift
class DataModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var name = "Some Name"
    @Published var isEnabled = false
}

struct MyView: View {
    @StateObject private var model = DataModel()

    var body: some View {
        Text(model.name)
        MySubView(model: model)
    }
}

struct MySubView: View {
    @ObservedObject var model: DataModel

    var body: some View {
        Toggle("Enabled", isOn: $model.isEnabled)
    }
}
```

When any published property of the observable object changes, SwiftUI updates any view that depends on the object. Subviews can also make updates to the model properties, like the [Toggle](toggle.md) in the above example, that propagate to other observers throughout the view hierarchy.

Don’t specify a default or initial value for the observed object. Use the attribute only for a property that acts as an input for a view, as in the above example.

> **Note**

> Don’t wrap objects conforming to the [Observable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/observation/observable) protocol with `@ObservedObject`. SwiftUI automatically tracks dependencies to `Observable` objects used within body and updates dependent views when their data changes. Attempting to wrap an `Observable` object with `@ObservedObject` may cause a compiler error, because it requires that its wrapped object to conform to the [ObservableObject](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/observableobject) protocol.
>
> If the view needs a binding to a property of an `Observable` object in its body, wrap the object with the [Bindable](bindable.md) property wrapper instead; for example, `@Bindable var model: DataModel`.

## Topics

### Creating an observed object

- [init(wrappedValue:)](observedobject/init%28wrappedvalue_%29.md): Creates an observed object with an initial wrapped value.
- [init(initialValue:)](observedobject/init%28initialvalue_%29.md): Creates an observed object with an initial value.

### Getting the value

- [wrappedValue](observedobject/wrappedvalue.md): The underlying value that the observed object references.
- [projectedValue](observedobject/projectedvalue.md): A projection of the observed object that creates bindings to its properties.
- [ObservedObject.Wrapper](observedobject/wrapper.md): A wrapper of the underlying observable object that can create bindings to its properties.
