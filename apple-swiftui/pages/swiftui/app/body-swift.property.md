## Discussion

For any app that you create, provide a computed `body` property that defines your app’s scenes, which are instances that conform to the [Scene](../scene.md) protocol. For example, you can create a simple app with a single scene containing a single view:

```swift
@main
struct MyApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            Text("Hello, world!")
        }
    }
}
```

Swift infers the app’s [Body](body-swift.associatedtype.md) associated type based on the scene provided by the `body` property.
