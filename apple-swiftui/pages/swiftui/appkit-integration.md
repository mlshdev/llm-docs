# AppKit integration

**Framework:** SwiftUI  
**Kind:** API Collection

Add AppKit views to your SwiftUI app, or use SwiftUI views in your AppKit app.

<a id="Overview"></a>

## Overview

Integrate SwiftUI with your app’s existing content using hosting controllers to add SwiftUI views into AppKit interfaces. A hosting controller wraps a set of SwiftUI views in a form that you can then add to your storyboard-based app.

You can also add AppKit views and view controllers to your SwiftUI interfaces. A representable object wraps the designated view or view controller, and facilitates communication between the wrapped object and your SwiftUI views.

For design guidance, see [Designing for macOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/designing-for-macos) in the Human Interface Guidelines.

## Topics

### Displaying SwiftUI views in AppKit

- [Unifying your app’s animations](unifying-your-app-s-animations.md): Create a consistent UI animation experience across SwiftUI, UIKit, and AppKit.
- [NSHostingController](nshostingcontroller.md): An AppKit view controller that hosts SwiftUI view hierarchy.
- [NSHostingView](nshostingview.md): An AppKit view that hosts a SwiftUI view hierarchy.
- [NSHostingMenu](nshostingmenu.md): An AppKit menu with menu items that are defined by a SwiftUI View.
- [NSHostingSizingOptions](nshostingsizingoptions.md): Options for how hosting views and controllers reflect their content’s size into Auto Layout constraints.
- [NSHostingSceneRepresentation](nshostingscenerepresentation.md): An AppKit type that hosts and can present SwiftUI scenes
- [NSHostingSceneBridgingOptions](nshostingscenebridgingoptions.md): Options for how hosting views and controllers manage aspects of the associated window.

### Adding AppKit views to SwiftUI view hierarchies

- [NSViewRepresentable](nsviewrepresentable.md): A wrapper that you use to integrate an AppKit view into your SwiftUI view hierarchy.
- [NSViewRepresentableContext](nsviewrepresentablecontext.md): Contextual information about the state of the system that you use to create and update your AppKit view.
- [NSViewControllerRepresentable](nsviewcontrollerrepresentable.md): A wrapper that you use to integrate an AppKit view controller into your SwiftUI interface.
- [NSViewControllerRepresentableContext](nsviewcontrollerrepresentablecontext.md): Contextual information about the state of the system that you use to create and update your AppKit view controller.

### Adding AppKit gesture recognizers into SwiftUI view hierarchies

- [NSGestureRecognizerRepresentable](nsgesturerecognizerrepresentable.md): A wrapper for an `NSGestureRecognizer` that you use to integrate that gesture recognizer into your SwiftUI hierarchy.
- [NSGestureRecognizerRepresentableContext](nsgesturerecognizerrepresentablecontext.md): Contextual information about the state of the system that you use to create and update a represented gesture recognizer.
- [NSGestureRecognizerRepresentableCoordinateSpaceConverter](nsgesturerecognizerrepresentablecoordinatespaceconverter.md): A structure used to convert locations to and from coordinate spaces in the hierarchy of the SwiftUI view associated with an [NSGestureRecognizerRepresentable](nsgesturerecognizerrepresentable.md).
