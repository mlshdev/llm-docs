# init(supportedContentTypes:validator:payloadAction:)

**Framework:** SwiftUI  
**Kind:** Initializer  
**Availability:** macOS 11.0+ (deprecated in 27.0)

Creates a Paste button that accepts specific types of data from the pasteboard, performing a custom validation of the data before sending it to your app.

> Use [init(payloadType:onPaste:)](init%28payloadtype_onpaste_%29.md) instead.

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated init<Payload>(supportedContentTypes: [UTType], validator: @escaping ([NSItemProvider]) -> Payload?, payloadAction: @escaping (Payload) -> Void)
```

## Parameters

- `supportedContentTypes`: The exact uniform type identifiers supported by the button. If the pasteboard doesn’t contain any of the supported types, the button becomes disabled.
- `validator`: A handler that receives those contents of the pasteboard that conform to `supportedContentTypes`. Load and inspect these items to determine whether to validate the button. If you load a valid item, return it from this closure. If the pasteboard doesn’t contain any valid items, return `nil` to invalidate the button.
- `payloadAction`: The handler called when the user clicks the button. This closure receives the preprocessed result of `validator`.

## Discussion

Set the contents of `supportedContentTypes` in order of your app’s preference for its supported types. The Paste button takes the most-preferred type that the pasteboard source supports and delivers this to the `validator` closure.
