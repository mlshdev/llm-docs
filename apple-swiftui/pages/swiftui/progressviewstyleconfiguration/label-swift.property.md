# label

**Framework:** SwiftUI  
**Kind:** Instance Property  
**Availability:** iOS 14.0+ · iPadOS 14.0+ · Mac Catalyst 14.0+ · macOS 11.0+ · tvOS 14.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 7.0+

A view that describes the task represented by the progress view.

## Declaration

```swift
var label: ProgressViewStyleConfiguration.Label?
```

<a id="discussion"></a>

## Discussion

If `nil`, then the task is self-evident from the surrounding context, and the style does not need to provide any additional description.

If the progress view is defined using a `Progress` instance, then this label is equivalent to its `localizedDescription`.
