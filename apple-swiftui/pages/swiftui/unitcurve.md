# UnitCurve

**Framework:** SwiftUI  
**Kind:** Structure  
**Availability:** iOS 17.0+ · iPadOS 17.0+ · Mac Catalyst 17.0+ · macOS 14.0+ · tvOS 17.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 10.0+

A  function defined by a two-dimensional curve that maps an input progress in the range \[0,1\] to an output progress that is also in the range \[0,1\]. By changing the shape of the curve, the effective speed of an animation or other interpolation can be changed.

## Declaration

```swift
struct UnitCurve
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

The horizontal (x) axis defines the input progress: a single input progress value in the range \[0,1\] must be provided when evaluating a curve.

The vertical (y) axis maps to the output progress: when a curve is evaluated, the y component of the point that intersects the input progress is returned.

## Topics

### Getting a linear curve

- [linear](unitcurve/linear.md): A linear curve.

### Getting easing curves

- [easeIn](unitcurve/easein.md): A bezier curve that starts out slowly, then speeds up as it finishes.
- [easeOut](unitcurve/easeout.md): A bezier curve that starts out quickly, then slows down as it approaches the end.
- [easeInOut](unitcurve/easeinout.md): A bezier curve that starts out slowly, speeds up over the middle, then slows down again as it approaches the end.
- [circularEaseIn](unitcurve/circulareasein.md): A curve that starts out slowly, then speeds up as it finishes.
- [circularEaseOut](unitcurve/circulareaseout.md): A circular curve that starts out quickly, then slows down as it approaches the end.
- [circularEaseInOut](unitcurve/circulareaseinout.md): A circular curve that starts out slowly, speeds up over the middle, then slows down again as it approaches the end.

### Creating a general Bezier curve

- [bezier(startControlPoint:endControlPoint:)](unitcurve/bezier%28startcontrolpoint_endcontrolpoint_%29.md): Creates a new curve using bezier control points.

### Inverting a curve

- [inverse](unitcurve/inverse.md): Returns a copy of the curve with its x and y components swapped.

### Getting curve characteristics

- [value(at:)](unitcurve/value%28at_%29.md): Returns the output value (y component) of the curve at the given time.
- [velocity(at:)](unitcurve/velocity%28at_%29.md): Returns the rate of change (first derivative) of the output value of the curve at the given time.

### Deprecated symbols

- [easeInEaseOut](unitcurve/easeineaseout.md): Deprecated. A bezier curve that starts out slowly, speeds up over the middle, then slows down again as it approaches the end.
