# accessibilityDragPoint(\_:description:)

**Framework:** SwiftUI  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 16.0+ · iPadOS 16.0+ · Mac Catalyst 16.0+ · macOS 13.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

The point an assistive technology should use to begin a drag interaction.

## Declaration

```swift
@export(implementation) nonisolated func accessibilityDragPoint(_ point: UnitPoint, description: LocalizedStringResource) -> ModifiedContent<Content, Modifier>
```

<a id="discussion"></a>

## Discussion

Use this modifier when you need to provide a description to users when prompted begin a drag interaction.

```swift
struct FileView: View {
    var filename: String

    var body: some View {
        FileIcon(filename: filename)
            .accessibilityDragPoint(.center, description: "Move \(filename)")
    }
}
```

By default, if an accessible view or its subtree has drag and/or drop interactions, they will be automatically exposed by assistive technologies. However, if there is more than one such interaction, each drag or drop should have a description to disambiguate it and give a good user experience.

> **Note**

> An accessibility element can have multiple points for a drag, provided they have different descriptions.
