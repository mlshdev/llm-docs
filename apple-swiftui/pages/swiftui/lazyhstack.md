## Overview

The stack is “lazy,” in that the stack view doesn’t create items until it needs to render them onscreen.

In the following example, a [ScrollView](scrollview.md) contains a `LazyHStack` that consists of a horizontal row of text views. The stack aligns to the top of the scroll view and uses 10-point spacing between each text view.

```swift
ScrollView(.horizontal) {
    LazyHStack(alignment: .top, spacing: 10) {
        ForEach(1...100, id: \.self) {
            Text("Column \($0)")
        }
    }
}
```
