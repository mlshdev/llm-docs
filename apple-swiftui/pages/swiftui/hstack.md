## Overview

Unlike [LazyHStack](lazyhstack.md), which only renders the views when your app needs to display them onscreen, an `HStack` renders the views all at once, regardless of whether they are on- or offscreen. Use the regular `HStack` when you have a small number of subviews or don’t want the delayed rendering behavior of the “lazy” version.

The following example shows a simple horizontal stack of five text views:

```swift
var body: some View {
    HStack(
        alignment: .top,
        spacing: 10
    ) {
        ForEach(
            1...5,
            id: \.self
        ) {
            Text("Item \($0)")
        }
    }
}
```

> **Note**

> If you need a horizontal stack that conforms to the [Layout](layout.md) protocol, like when you want to create a conditional layout using [AnyLayout](anylayout.md), use [HStackLayout](hstacklayout.md) instead.
