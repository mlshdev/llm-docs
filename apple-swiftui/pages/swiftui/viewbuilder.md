## Overview

When you build your project in Xcode 26 and earlier, use [ViewBuilder](viewbuilder.md) as a parameter attribute for view-producing closure parameters, allowing those closures to provide multiple child views. For example, the following `contextMenu` function accepts a closure that produces one or more views via the view builder.

```swift
func contextMenu<MenuItems: View>(
    @ViewBuilder menuItems: () -> MenuItems
) -> some View
```

Clients of this function can use multiple-statement closures to provide several child views, as the following example shows:

```swift
myView.contextMenu {
    Text("Cut")
    Text("Copy")
    Text("Paste")
    if isSymbol {
        Text("Jump to Definition")
    }
}
```

When you build in Xcode 27 and later for any version of SwiftUI, the system constructs type-agnostic content from `ViewBuilder` closures, and doesn’t restrict the types you use in closures to conform to [View](view.md). Mark closures with the type alias [ContentBuilder](contentbuilder.md) instead to indicate where your code expects this behavior. For more information, see [ContentBuilder](contentbuilder.md).

## Topics

### Building content

- [buildBlock()](viewbuilder/buildblock%28%29.md): Builds an empty content from a block containing no statements.
- [buildBlock(\_:)](viewbuilder/buildblock%28__%29.md): Passes a single piece of content written as a child view through unmodified.

### Conditionally building content

- [buildEither(first:)](viewbuilder/buildeither%28first_%29.md): Produces content for a conditional statement in a multi-statement closure when the condition is true.
- [buildEither(second:)](viewbuilder/buildeither%28second_%29.md): Produces content for a conditional statement in a multi-statement closure when the condition is false.
- [buildIf(\_:)](viewbuilder/buildif%28__%29.md): Produces optional content for conditional statements in multi-statement closures that’s only included when the condition evaluates to true.
- [buildLimitedAvailability(\_:)](viewbuilder/buildlimitedavailability%28__%29.md)
