## Discussion

Use this style when there are more than five options. Consider using [inline](inline.md) when there are fewer than five options.

The button itself indicates the selected option. You can include additional controls in the set of options, such as a button to customize the list of options.

To apply this style to a picker, or to a view that contains pickers, use the [pickerStyle(\_:)](../view/pickerstyle%28__%29.md) modifier.
