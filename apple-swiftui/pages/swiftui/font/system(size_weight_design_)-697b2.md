# system(size:weight:design:)

**Framework:** SwiftUI  
**Kind:** Type Method  
**Availability:** iOS 16.0+ · iPadOS 16.0+ · Mac Catalyst 16.0+ · macOS 13.0+ · tvOS 16.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 9.0+

Specifies a system font to use, along with the style, weight, and any design parameters you want applied to the text.

## Declaration

```swift
static func system(size: CGFloat, weight: Font.Weight? = nil, design: Font.Design? = nil) -> Font
```

## Discussion

Use this function to create a system font by specifying the size and weight, and a type design together. The following styles the system font as 17 point, [semibold](weight/semibold.md) text:

```swift
Text("Hello").font(.system(size: 17, weight: .semibold))
```

While the following styles the text as 17 point [bold](weight/bold.md), and applies a `serif` [Font.Design](design.md) to the system font:

```swift
Text("Hello").font(.system(size: 17, weight: .bold, design: .serif))
```

Both `weight` and `design` can be optional. When you do not provide a `weight` or `design`, the system can pick one based on the current context, which may not be [regular](weight/regular.md) or [Font.Design.default](design/default.md) in certain context. The following example styles the text as 17 point system font using [Font.Design.rounded](design/rounded.md) design, while its weight can depend on the current context:

```swift
Text("Hello").font(.system(size: 17, design: .rounded))
```
