# write(snapshot:to:previous:progress:)

**Framework:** SwiftUI  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 27.0+ · iPadOS 27.0+ · Mac Catalyst 27.0+ · macOS 27.0+ · visionOS 27.0+

Writes the document content to disk.

## Declaration

```swift
@concurrent func write(snapshot: sending Self.Snapshot, to destination: sending Self.Destination, previous: sending Self.Snapshot?, progress: consuming Subprogress) async throws
```

## Parameters

- `snapshot`: The snapshot to write to disk.
- `destination`: The file URL to write to.
- `previous`: The last successfully written snapshot, or `nil` on the first save. Compare to `content` to write only what changed in package documents.
- `progress`: A `Subprogress` value to report writing progress. Consume it once with `reporter(totalCount:)` and call `complete(count:)` as units finish.

## Discussion

SwiftUI calls this method in the background after obtaining a snapshot via [snapshot(contentType:)](../writabledocument/snapshot%28contenttype_%29.md). Perform all serialization and disk access here.

For most documents, use [FileWrapperDocumentWriter](../filewrapperdocumentwriter.md) instead of implementing a custom writer. Only implement `write` yourself when you need capabilities `FileWrapperDocumentWriter` doesn’t provide — such as direct URL access for Core Graphics, AVFoundation, or other frameworks that operate on file paths:

```swift
@concurrent
func write(content image: sending CGImage, to destination: URL,
    previous: sending CGImage?, progress: consuming Subprogress
) async throws {
    guard let imageDestination =
        CGImageDestinationCreateWithURL(
            destination as CFURL,
            UTType.jpeg.identifier as CFString,
            1, nil
        ) else {
        throw CocoaError(.fileWriteUnknown)
    }
    CGImageDestinationAddImage(
        imageDestination, image, nil
    )
    guard CGImageDestinationFinalize(
        imageDestination
    ) else {
        throw CocoaError(.fileWriteUnknown)
    }
}
```
