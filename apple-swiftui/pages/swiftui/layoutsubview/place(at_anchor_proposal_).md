# place(at:anchor:proposal:)

**Framework:** SwiftUI  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 16.0+ · iPadOS 16.0+ · Mac Catalyst 16.0+ · macOS 13.0+ · tvOS 16.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 9.0+

Assigns a position and proposed size to the subview.

## Declaration

```swift
func place(at position: CGPoint, anchor: UnitPoint = .topLeading, proposal: ProposedViewSize)
```

## Parameters

- `position`: The place where the anchor of the subview should appear in its container view, relative to container’s bounds.
- `anchor`: The unit point on the subview that appears at `position`. You can use a built-in point, like [center](../unitpoint/center.md), or you can create a custom [UnitPoint](../unitpoint.md).
- `proposal`: A proposed size for the subview. In SwiftUI, views choose their own size, but can take a size proposal from their parent view into account when doing so.

## Discussion

Call this method from your implementation of the [Layout](../layout.md) protocol’s [placeSubviews(in:proposal:subviews:cache:)](../layout/placesubviews%28in_proposal_subviews_cache_%29.md) method for each subview arranged by the layout. Provide a position within the container’s bounds where the subview should appear, and an anchor that indicates which part of the subview appears at that point.

Include a proposed size that the subview can take into account when sizing itself. To learn the subview’s size for a given proposal before calling this method, you can call the [dimensions(in:)](dimensions%28in_%29.md) or [sizeThatFits(\_:)](sizethatfits%28__%29.md) method on the subview with the same proposal. That enables you to know subview sizes before committing to subview positions.

> **Important**

> Call this method only from within your [Layout](../layout.md) type’s implementation of the [placeSubviews(in:proposal:subviews:cache:)](../layout/placesubviews%28in_proposal_subviews_cache_%29.md) method.

If you call this method more than once for a subview, the last call takes precedence. If you don’t call this method for a subview, the subview appears at the center of its layout container and uses the layout container’s size proposal.
