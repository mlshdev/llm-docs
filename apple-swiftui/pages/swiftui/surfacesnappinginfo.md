## Overview

Use the provided [SurfaceSnappingInfo](surfacesnappinginfo.md) to modify the contents of your view.

```swift
struct LightFixtureView: View {
    @Environment(\.surfaceSnappingInfo)
    var snappingInfo: SurfaceSnappingInfo

    var body: some View {
        if snappingInfo.isSnapped {
            switch SurfaceSnappingInfo.authorizationStatus {
                case .authorized:
                    switch snappingInfo.classification {
                        case .table:
                            LampView()
                        case .floor:
                            FloorLampView()
                        default:
                            DefaultLampView()
                    }
                default:
                    DefaultLampView()
            }
        } else {
            FloatingOrbLampView()
        }
    }
}
```

The bottom of volumes may snap to horizontal surfaces and the back of windows may snap to vertical surfaces.

## Topics

### Instance Properties

- [classification](surfacesnappinginfo/classification.md): A type that provides information about the surface classification the scene is snapped to. This property only has a value if the scene is snapped and `authorizationStatus` is `.authorized`.
- [isSnapped](surfacesnappinginfo/issnapped.md): A value that represents whether the scene is currently snapped to a physical surface or not.

### Type Properties

- [authorizationStatus](surfacesnappinginfo/authorizationstatus-swift.type.property.md): A value that represents whether the user has authorized providing more detailed information about the surface scenes are snapped to. To request this detailed surface information, in your `Info.plist` file, set `UIWantsDetailedSurfaceInfo` to `YES` and set `NSWorldSensingUsageDescription` to provide a description of why your app is requesting this information.

### Enumerations

- [SurfaceSnappingInfo.AuthorizationStatus](surfacesnappinginfo/authorizationstatus-swift.enum.md): A type representing whether the user has granted permissions to provide more detailed information about the surface a scene is snapped to.
