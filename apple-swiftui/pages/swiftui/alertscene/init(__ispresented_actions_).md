# init(\_:isPresented:actions:)

**Framework:** SwiftUI  
**Kind:** Initializer  
**Availability:** macOS 15.0+

Creates an alert scene with a title and a set of actions. Note that this creates a text view on your behalf.

## Declaration

```swift
@export(implementation) nonisolated init(_ titleResource: LocalizedStringResource, isPresented: Binding<Bool>, @ContentBuilder actions: () -> Actions) where Message == EmptyView
```

## Parameters

- `titleResource`: Text resource for the localized string that is the title of the alert.
- `isPresented`: A binding to a Boolean value that determines whether to present the alert. When someone presses or taps one of the alert’s actions, the system sets this value to `false` and dismisses.
- `actions`: A [ContentBuilder](../contentbuilder.md) returning the actions for the dialog.
