## Overview

The [DropDelegate](dropdelegate.md) protocol provides a comprehensive and flexible way to interact with a drop operation. Specify a drop delegate when you modify a view to accept drops with the [onDrop(of:delegate:)](view/ondrop%28of_delegate_%29.md) method.

Alternatively, for simple drop cases that don’t require the full functionality of a drop delegate, you can modify a view to accept drops using the [onDrop(of:isTargeted:perform:)](view/ondrop%28of_istargeted_perform_%29.md) method. This method handles the drop using a closure you provide as part of the modifier.

## Topics

### Receiving drop information

- [dropEntered(info:)](dropdelegate/dropentered%28info_%29.md): Tells the delegate a validated drop has entered the modified view.
- [dropExited(info:)](dropdelegate/dropexited%28info_%29.md): Tells the delegate a validated drop operation has exited the modified view.
- [dropUpdated(info:)](dropdelegate/dropupdated%28info_%29.md): Tells the delegate that a validated drop moved inside the modified view.
- [validateDrop(info:)](dropdelegate/validatedrop%28info_%29.md): Tells the delegate that a drop containing items conforming to one of the expected types entered a view that accepts drops.
- [performDrop(info:)](dropdelegate/performdrop%28info_%29.md): Tells the delegate it can request the item provider data from the given information.
