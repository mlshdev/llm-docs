# TextSelectionAffinity

**Framework:** SwiftUI  
**Kind:** Enumeration  
**Availability:** iOS 18.0+ · iPadOS 18.0+ · Mac Catalyst 18.0+ · macOS 15.0+ · tvOS 18.0+ · visionOS 2.0+ · watchOS 11.0+

A representation of the direction or association of a selection or cursor relative to a text character. This concept becomes much more prominent when dealing with bidirectional text (text that contains both LTR and RTL scripts, like English and Arabic combined).

## Declaration

```swift
enum TextSelectionAffinity
```

<a id="overview"></a>

## Overview

This type also determines whether, for example, the insertion point appears after the last character on a line or before the first character on the following line in cases where text wraps across line boundaries.

Given the scenario `hello|مرحبا`, where `|` represents the cursor & `مرحبا` represents “hello” in Arabic, the ambiguity arises because:

- If the cursor is associated with the end of the English word, it would be as if you’re continuing to type in English (LTR).
- If the cursor is associated with the beginning of the Arabic word, it would also be as if you’re continuing to type in Arabic (RTL).

`TextSelectionAffinity` helps resolve this ambiguity by determining the direction or association of the cursor relative to the surrounding text.

You can configure the selection affinity on a given hierarchy by using the [textSelectionAffinity(\_:)](view/textselectionaffinity%28__%29.md) modifier:

```swift
struct SuggestionTextEditor: View {
    @State var text: String = ""
    @State var selection: TextSelection? = nil

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            TextEditor(text: $text, selection: $selection)
            // A helper view that offers live suggestions based on selection.
            SuggestionsView(
                substrings: getSubstrings(text: text, indices: selection?.indices))
        }
        .textSelectionAffinity(.upstream)
    }

    private func getSubstrings(
        text: String, indices: TextSelection.Indices?
    ) -> [Substring] {
        // Resolve substrings representing the current selection...
    }
}

struct SuggestionsView: View { ... }
```

## Topics

### Enumeration Cases

- [TextSelectionAffinity.automatic](textselectionaffinity/automatic.md): A selection affinity determined by the framework based on the current context.
- [TextSelectionAffinity.downstream](textselectionaffinity/downstream.md): An downstream selection affinity. In this case, the cursor is associated with the character immediately after it.
- [TextSelectionAffinity.upstream](textselectionaffinity/upstream.md): An upstream selection affinity. In this case, the cursor is associated with the character immediately before it.
