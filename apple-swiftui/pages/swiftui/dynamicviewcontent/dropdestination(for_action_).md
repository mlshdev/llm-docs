# dropDestination(for:action:)

**Framework:** SwiftUI

Sets the insert action for the dynamic view.

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated func dropDestination<T>(for payloadType: T.Type = T.self, action: @escaping ([T], Int) -> Void) -> some DynamicViewContent where T : Transferable

```

## Parameters

- `payloadType`: Type of the models that are dropped.
- `action`: A closure that SwiftUI invokes when elements are added to the view. The closure takes two arguments: The first argument is the offset relative to the dynamic view’s underlying collection of data. The second argument is an array of `Transferable` items that represents the data that you want to insert.

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

A view that calls `action` when elements are inserted into the original view.

<a id="discussion"></a>

## Discussion

```swift
struct Profile: Identifiable {
    let givenName: String
    let familyName: String
    let id = UUID()
}

@State private var profiles: [Profile] = [
    Person(givenName: "Juan", familyName: "Chavez"),
    Person(givenName: "Mei", familyName: "Chen"),
    Person(givenName: "Tom", familyName: "Clark"),
    Person(givenName: "Gita", familyName: "Kumar")
]

var body: some View {
    List {
        ForEach(profiles) { profile in
            Text(profile.givenName)
        }
        .dropDestination(for: Profile.self) { receivedProfiles, offset in
            profiles.insert(contentsOf: receivedProfiles, at: offset)
        }
    }
}
```
