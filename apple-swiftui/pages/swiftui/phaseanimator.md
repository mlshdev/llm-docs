# PhaseAnimator

**Framework:** SwiftUI  
**Kind:** Structure  
**Availability:** iOS 17.0+ · iPadOS 17.0+ · Mac Catalyst 17.0+ · macOS 14.0+ · tvOS 17.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 10.0+

A container that animates its content by automatically cycling through a collection of phases that you provide, each defining a discrete step within an animation.

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated struct PhaseAnimator<Phase, Content> where Phase : Equatable, Content : View
```

## Overview

Use one of the phase animator view modifiers like [phaseAnimator(\_:content:animation:)](view/phaseanimator%28__content_animation_%29.md) to create a phased animation in your app.

## Topics

### Creating a phase animator

- [init(\_:content:animation:)](phaseanimator/init%28__content_animation_%29.md): Cycles through a sequence of phases continuously, animating updates to a view on each phase change.
- [init(\_:trigger:content:animation:)](phaseanimator/init%28__trigger_content_animation_%29.md): Cycles through a sequence of phases in response to changes in a specified value, animating updates to a view on each phase change.

## Relationships

### Conforms To

- [View](view.md)

- [phaseAnimator(\_:content:animation:)](view/phaseanimator%28__content_animation_%29.md): Animates effects that you apply to a view over a sequence of phases that change continuously.
- [phaseAnimator(\_:trigger:content:animation:)](view/phaseanimator%28__trigger_content_animation_%29.md): Animates effects that you apply to a view over a sequence of phases that change based on a trigger.
