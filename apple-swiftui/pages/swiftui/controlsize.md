## Topics

### Getting control sizes

- [ControlSize.mini](controlsize/mini.md): A control version that is minimally sized.
- [ControlSize.small](controlsize/small.md): A control version that is proportionally smaller size for space-constrained views.
- [ControlSize.regular](controlsize/regular.md): A control version that is the default size.
- [ControlSize.large](controlsize/large.md): A control version that is prominently sized.
- [ControlSize.extraLarge](controlsize/extralarge.md): A control version that is substantially sized. The largest control size. Resolves to [ControlSize.large](controlsize/large.md) on platforms other than visionOS.

### Initializers

- [init(\_:)](controlsize/init%28__%29.md): Creates a control size from its NSControl.ControlSize equivalent.
