### Getting location information

- [location](accessibilityzoomgestureaction/location.md): The zoom gesture’s activation point, normalized to the accessibility element’s frame.
- [point](accessibilityzoomgestureaction/point.md): The zoom gesture’s activation point within the window’s coordinate space.
