## Discussion

This function sets the given [Animation](animation.md) as the [animation](transaction/animation.md) property of the thread’s current [Transaction](transaction.md) as well as calling `Transaction/addAnimationCompletion` with the specified completion.

The completion callback will always be fired exactly one time. If no animations are created by the changes in `body`, then the callback will be called immediately after `body`.
