# environment(\_:\_:)

**Framework:** SwiftUI  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 14.0+ · iPadOS 14.0+ · Mac Catalyst 14.0+ · macOS 11.0+ · tvOS 14.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 7.0+

Sets the environment value of the specified key path to the given value.

## Declaration

```swift
@export(implementation) nonisolated func environment<V>(_ keyPath: WritableKeyPath<EnvironmentValues, V>, _ value: V) -> some Scene

```

## Parameters

- `keyPath`: A key path that indicates the property of the [EnvironmentValues](../environmentvalues.md) structure to update.
- `value`: The new value to set for the item specified by `keyPath`.

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

A view that has the given value set in its environment.

<a id="discussion"></a>

## Discussion

Use this modifier to set one of the writable properties of the [EnvironmentValues](../environmentvalues.md) structure, including custom values that you create. For example, you can create a custom environment key `styleOverrides` to set a value that represents style settings that for the entire app:

```swift
WindowGroup {
    ContentView()
}
.environment(\.styleOverrides, StyleOverrides())
```

You then read the value inside `ContentView` or one of its descendants using the [Environment](../environment.md) property wrapper:

```swift
struct MyView: View {
    @Environment(\.styleOverrides) var styleOverrides: StyleOverrides

    var body: some View { ... }
}
```

This modifier affects the given scene, as well as that scene’s descendant views. It has no effect outside the view hierarchy on which you call it.
