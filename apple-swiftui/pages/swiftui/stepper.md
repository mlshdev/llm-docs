# Stepper

**Framework:** SwiftUI  
**Kind:** Structure  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.15+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 9.0+

A control that performs increment and decrement actions.

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated struct Stepper<Label> where Label : View
```

## Overview

Use a stepper control when you want the user to have granular control while incrementing or decrementing a value. For example, you can use a stepper to:

- Change a value up or down by `1`.
- Operate strictly over a prescribed range.
- Step by specific amounts over a stepper’s range of possible values.

The example below uses an array that holds a number of [Color](color.md) values, a local state variable, `value`, to set the control’s background color, and title label. When the user clicks or taps the stepper’s increment or decrement buttons, SwiftUI executes the relevant closure that updates `value`, wrapping the `value` to prevent overflow. SwiftUI then re-renders the view, updating the text and background color to match the current index:

```swift
struct StepperView: View {
    @State private var value = 0
    let colors: [Color] = [.orange, .red, .gray, .blue,
                           .green, .purple, .pink]

    func incrementStep() {
        value += 1
        if value >= colors.count { value = 0 }
    }

    func decrementStep() {
        value -= 1
        if value < 0 { value = colors.count - 1 }
    }

    var body: some View {
        Stepper {
            Text("Value: \(value) Color: \(colors[value].description)")
        } onIncrement: {
            incrementStep()
        } onDecrement: {
            decrementStep()
        }
        .padding(5)
        .background(colors[value])
    }
}
```

The following example shows a stepper that displays the effect of incrementing or decrementing a value with the step size of `step` with the bounds defined by `range`:

```swift
struct StepperView: View {
    @State private var value = 0
    let step = 5
    let range = 1...50

    var body: some View {
        Stepper(
            value: $value,
            in: range,
            step: step
        ) {
            Text("Current: \(value) in \(range.description) " +
                 "stepping by \(step)")
        }
        .padding(10)
    }
}
```

## Topics

### Creating a stepper

- [init(value:step:label:onEditingChanged:)](stepper/init%28value_step_label_oneditingchanged_%29.md): Conforms when `Label` conforms to `View`. Creates a stepper configured to increment or decrement a binding to a value using a step value you provide.
- [init(value:step:format:label:onEditingChanged:)](stepper/init%28value_step_format_label_oneditingchanged_%29.md): Conforms when `Label` conforms to `View`. Creates a stepper configured to increment or decrement a binding to a value using a step value you provide, displaying its value with an applied format style.
- [init(\_:value:step:onEditingChanged:)](stepper/init%28__value_step_oneditingchanged_%29.md): Conforms when `Label` is `Text`. Creates a stepper with a title key and configured to increment and decrement a binding to a value and step amount you provide.
- [init(\_:value:step:format:onEditingChanged:)](stepper/init%28__value_step_format_oneditingchanged_%29.md): Conforms when `Label` is `Text`. Creates a stepper with a title key and configured to increment and decrement a binding to a value and step amount you provide, displaying its value with an applied format style.

### Creating a stepper over a range

- [init(value:in:step:label:onEditingChanged:)](stepper/init%28value_in_step_label_oneditingchanged_%29.md): Conforms when `Label` conforms to `View`. Creates a stepper configured to increment or decrement a binding to a value using a step value and within a range of values you provide.
- [init(value:in:step:format:label:onEditingChanged:)](stepper/init%28value_in_step_format_label_oneditingchanged_%29.md): Conforms when `Label` conforms to `View`. Creates a stepper configured to increment or decrement a binding to a value using a step value and within a range of values you provide, displaying its value with an applied format style.
- [init(\_:value:in:step:onEditingChanged:)](stepper/init%28__value_in_step_oneditingchanged_%29.md): Conforms when `Label` is `Text`. Creates a stepper instance that increments and decrements a binding to a value, by a step size and within a closed range that you provide.
- [init(\_:value:in:step:format:onEditingChanged:)](stepper/init%28__value_in_step_format_oneditingchanged_%29.md): Conforms when `Label` is `Text`. Creates a stepper instance that increments and decrements a binding to a value, by a step size and within a closed range that you provide, displaying its value with an applied format style.

### Creating a stepper with change behavior

- [init(label:onIncrement:onDecrement:onEditingChanged:)](stepper/init%28label_onincrement_ondecrement_oneditingchanged_%29.md): Creates a stepper instance that performs the closures you provide when the user increments or decrements the stepper.
- [init(\_:onIncrement:onDecrement:onEditingChanged:)](stepper/init%28__onincrement_ondecrement_oneditingchanged_%29.md): Conforms when `Label` is `Text`. Creates a stepper that uses a title key and executes the closures you provide when the user clicks or taps the stepper’s increment and decrement buttons.

### Deprecated initializers

- [init(value:step:onEditingChanged:label:)](stepper/init%28value_step_oneditingchanged_label_%29.md): Deprecated. Conforms when `Label` conforms to `View`. Creates a stepper configured to increment or decrement a binding to a value using a step value you provide.
- [init(value:in:step:onEditingChanged:label:)](stepper/init%28value_in_step_oneditingchanged_label_%29.md): Deprecated. Conforms when `Label` conforms to `View`. Creates a stepper configured to increment or decrement a binding to a value using a step value and within a range of values you provide.
- [init(onIncrement:onDecrement:onEditingChanged:label:)](stepper/init%28onincrement_ondecrement_oneditingchanged_label_%29.md): Deprecated. Conforms when `Label` conforms to `View`.
