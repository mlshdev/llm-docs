# environment(\_:\_:)

**Framework:** SwiftUI  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 13.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 6.0+

Sets the environment value of the specified key path to the given value.

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated func environment<V>(_ keyPath: WritableKeyPath<EnvironmentValues, V>, _ value: V) -> some View

```

## Parameters

- `keyPath`: A key path that indicates the property of the [EnvironmentValues](../environmentvalues.md) structure to update.
- `value`: The new value to set for the item specified by `keyPath`.

## Return Value

A view that has the given value set in its environment.

## Discussion

Use this modifier to set one of the writable properties of the [EnvironmentValues](../environmentvalues.md) structure, including custom values that you create. For example, you can set the value associated with the [truncationMode](../environmentvalues/truncationmode.md) key:

```swift
MyView()
    .environment(\.truncationMode, .head)
```

You then read the value inside `MyView` or one of its descendants using the [Environment](../environment.md) property wrapper:

```swift
struct MyView: View {
    @Environment(\.truncationMode) var truncationMode: Text.TruncationMode

    var body: some View { ... }
}
```

SwiftUI provides dedicated view modifiers for setting most environment values, like the [truncationMode(\_:)](truncationmode%28__%29.md) modifier which sets the [truncationMode](../environmentvalues/truncationmode.md) value:

```swift
MyView()
    .truncationMode(.head)
```

Prefer the dedicated modifier when available, and offer your own when defining custom environment values, as described in [Entry()](../entry%28%29.md).

This modifier affects the given view, as well as that view’s descendant views. It has no effect outside the view hierarchy on which you call it.
