**Framework:** StoreKit

**Availability:** iOS 17.0+ · iPadOS 17.0+ · Mac Catalyst 17.0+ · macOS 14.0+ · tvOS 17.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 10.0+

Adds an action to perform when a person uses the sign-in button on a subscription store view within a view.

## Declaration

nonisolated func subscriptionStoreSignInAction(_ action: (() -> ())?) -> some View

```

## Parameters

- `action`: The action to perform. Pass `nil` to remove the sign in action for subscription stores within this view. The default value is `nil`.

## Discussion

You can only have one sign in action for a view. If an ancestor view specifies a sign in action, using this modifier will replace the ancestor’s sign in action.

If the value is `nil`, subscription stores will never show a sign in button. You can also hide the sign in button without removing the action by using the [storeButton(\_:for:)](storebutton%28__for_%29.md) modifier, providing [signIn](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/storebuttonkind/signin) as the button kind.
