Declares the view as dependent on the status of an auto-renewable subscription group, and returns a modified view.

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated func subscriptionStatusTask(for groupID: String, priority: TaskPriority = .medium, action: @escaping (EntitlementTaskState<[Product.SubscriptionInfo.Status]>) async -> ()) -> some View

```

## Parameters

- `groupID`: The subscription group ID to get the status for. The task restarts whenever this parameter changes.
- `priority`: The task priority to use when creating the task.
- `action`: The action to perform when the task’s state changes.

## Discussion

Before a view modified with this method appears, a task will start in the background to get the subscription status. While the view is presented, the task will call `action` whenever the status changes or the task’s state changes.
