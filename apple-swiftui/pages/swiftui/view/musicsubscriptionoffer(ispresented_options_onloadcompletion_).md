# musicSubscriptionOffer(isPresented:options:onLoadCompletion:)

**Framework:** MusicKit  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 15.0+ · iPadOS 15.0+ · Mac Catalyst 15.0+ · macOS 12.0+

Initiates the process of presenting a sheet with subscription offers for Apple Music when the `isPresented` binding is `true`.

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated func musicSubscriptionOffer(isPresented: Binding<Bool>, options: MusicSubscriptionOffer.Options = .default, onLoadCompletion: @escaping ((any Error)?) -> Void = { _ in }) -> some View

```

## Parameters

- `isPresented`: A binding to a Boolean value that you can set to `true` to show a sheet with subscription offers for Apple Music.
- `options`: Options to use for loading the subscription offer for Apple Music.
- `onLoadCompletion`: The function to call upon completing the initial loading process for this subscription offer. The subscription offer UI becomes visible when it calls this function with the error argument as `nil`. If there is an error in the loading process, the subscription offer calls this function with a non-`nil` error, and it resets the `isPresented` binding to `false`.

## Discussion

The example below displays a simple button that the user can activate to begin presenting subscription offers for Apple Music. The action handler of this button initiates the presentation of those offers by setting the `isShowingOffer` variable to `true`.

```swift
struct MusicSubscriptionOfferButton: View {
    @State var isShowingOffer = false
    var body: some View {
        Button("Apple Music Subscription Offer") {
            isShowingOffer = true
        }
        .musicSubscriptionOffer(isPresented: $isShowingOffer)
    }
}
```

You can also configure the Apple Music subscription offer by creating an instance of `MusicSubscriptionOffer.Options`, setting relevant properties on it, and passing it to `.musicSubscriptionOffer(…)`. For example, to present contextual offers that highlight a specific album, you can configure the subscription offer like the following:

```swift
struct MusicSubscriptionOfferButton: View {
    var album: Album
    @State var isShowingOffer = false
    @State var offerOptions = MusicSubscriptionOffer.Options(
        affiliateToken: "<affiliate_token>", 
        campaignToken: "<campaign_token>"
    )

    var body: some View {
        Button("Apple Music Subscription Offer") {
            offerOptions.itemID = album.id
            isShowingOffer = true
        }
        .musicSubscriptionOffer(
            isPresented: $isShowingOffer, 
            options: offerOptions
        )
    }
}
```

The initial value of `offerOptions` includes relevant tokens (affiliate and campaign tokens) that allow you to receive compensation for referring new Apple Music subscribers. For more information, see this presentation of the [Apple Services Performance Partners Program](https://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/resources/).

You may also set `isShowingOffer` to `false` to programmatically dismiss the subscription offer (or to abort its loading process).
