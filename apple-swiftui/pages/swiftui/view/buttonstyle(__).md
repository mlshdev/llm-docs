# buttonStyle(\_:)

**Framework:** SwiftUI  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 13.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 6.0+

Sets the style for buttons within this view to a button style with a custom appearance and standard interaction behavior.

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated func buttonStyle<S>(_ style: S) -> some View where S : ButtonStyle

```

<a id="discussion"></a>

## Discussion

Use this modifier to set a specific style for all button instances within a view:

```swift
HStack {
    Button("Sign In", action: signIn)
    Button("Register", action: register)
}
.buttonStyle(.bordered)
```

You can also use this modifier to set the style for controls that acquire a button style through composition, like the [Menu](../menu.md) and [Toggle](../toggle.md) views in the following example:

```swift
VStack {
    Menu("Terms and Conditions") {
        Button("Open in Preview", action: openInPreview)
        Button("Save as PDF", action: saveAsPDF)
    }
    Toggle("Remember Password", isOn: $isToggleOn)
    Toggle("Flag", isOn: $flagged)
    Button("Sign In", action: signIn)
}
.menuStyle(.button)
.toggleStyle(.button)
.buttonStyle(.bordered)
```

The [menuStyle(\_:)](menustyle%28__%29.md) modifier causes the Terms and Conditions menu to render as a button. Similarly, the [toggleStyle(\_:)](togglestyle%28__%29.md) modifier causes the two toggles to render as buttons. The button style modifier then causes not only the explicit Sign In [Button](../button.md), but also the menu and toggles with button styling, to render with the bordered button style.
