## Discussion

You can use `onChange` to trigger a side effect as the result of a value changing, such as an `Environment` key or a `Binding`.

The system may call the action closure on the main actor, so avoid long-running tasks in the closure. If you need to perform such tasks, detach an asynchronous background task.

When the value changes, the new version of the closure will be called, so any captured values will have their values from the time that the observed value has its new value. In the following code example, `PlayerView` calls into its model when `playState` changes model.

```swift
struct PlayerView: View {
    var episode: Episode
    @State private var playState: PlayState = .paused

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text(episode.title)
            Text(episode.showTitle)
            PlayButton(playState: $playState)
        }
        .onChange(of: playState) {
            model.playStateDidChange(state: playState)
        }
    }
}
```
