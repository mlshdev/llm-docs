# contentShape(\_:\_:eoFill:)

**Framework:** SwiftUI  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 15.0+ · iPadOS 15.0+ · Mac Catalyst 15.0+ · macOS 12.0+ · tvOS 15.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 8.0+

Sets the content shape for this view.

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated func contentShape<S>(_ kind: ContentShapeKinds, _ shape: S, eoFill: Bool = false) -> some View where S : Shape

```

## Parameters

- `kind`: The kinds to apply to this content shape.
- `shape`: The shape to use.
- `eoFill`: A Boolean that indicates whether the shape is interpreted with the even-odd winding number rule.

## Return Value

A view that uses the given shape for the specified kind.

## Discussion

The content shape has a variety of uses. You can control the kind of the content shape by specifying one in `kind`. The following example sets the focus ring shape of the view, without affecting its shape for hit-testing:

```swift
MyFocusableView()
    .contentShape(.focusEffect, Circle())
```

You can apply multiple kinds of content shapes to the same view. For example, apply a [interaction](../contentshapekinds/interaction.md) shape and [focusEffect](../contentshapekinds/focuseffect.md) shape together to set both the hit-testing shape and focus ring shape on a view.

<a id="Context-Menu--Drag-Previews"></a>

## Context Menu & Drag Previews

You can control the preview shown by the system for context menus or drags using the relevant content shape kind, like [dragPreview](../contentshapekinds/dragpreview.md) and [contextMenuPreview](../contentshapekinds/contextmenupreview.md).

The following example creates a [VStack](../vstack.md) of an [Image](../image.md) and [Text](../text.md) that has a context menu with a custom content shape:

```swift
VStack {
    Image("turtlerock")
        .contentShape(.contextMenuPreview,
                      RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 10))
    Text("Turtle Rock")
}
.contextMenu {
    Button {
        // Add this item to a list of favorites.
    } label: {
        Label("Add to Favorites", systemImage: "heart")
    }
}
```

When someone activates the context menu with an action like touch and hold in iOS or iPadOS, the system uses the [Image](../image.md) as the preview for the context menu, applying the requested corner radius.

The content shape also supports applying modifiers such as [inset(by:)](../insettableshape/inset%28by_%29.md) to add padding.

> **Note**

> Similar to [focusEffect](../contentshapekinds/focuseffect.md), the [contextMenuPreview](../contentshapekinds/contextmenupreview.md) and [dragPreview](../contentshapekinds/dragpreview.md) content shapes do not impact the hit-testing shape. In this example, someone can touch and hold anywhere on the [VStack](../vstack.md) to activate the menu. If you only want the [Image](../image.md) to activate the menu, apply [contextMenu(menuItems:)](contextmenu%28menuitems_%29.md) to the [Image](../image.md) instead.
