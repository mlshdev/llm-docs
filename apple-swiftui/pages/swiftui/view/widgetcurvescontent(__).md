## Discussion

The system positions the widget’s content along a curve that follows the corner of the watch face when displaying a [WidgetFamily.accessoryCorner](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/widgetkit/widgetfamily/accessorycorner) complication. The widget must use  a  [widgetLabel(\_:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/widgetlabel%28_:%29-7wguh) modifier, and the curving effect modifies only text, SF Symbols, and images.

When displaying an `.accessoryCorner` complication, the system places the widget label on the inside of the curve, and the widget’s content on the outside, as shown below.

```swift
var body: some View {
    Text("Hi")
        .widgetCurvesContent()
        .widgetLabel("World!")
}
```

The system can also curve text, SF symbols, and image content from a [ViewThatFits](../viewthatfits.md) view.

```swift
var body: some View {
    ViewThatFits {
        Text("Hello")
        Text("Hi")
    }
    .widgetCurvesContent()
    .widgetLabel("World!")
}
```
