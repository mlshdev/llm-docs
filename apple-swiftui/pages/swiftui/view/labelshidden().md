# labelsHidden()

**Framework:** SwiftUI  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 13.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 6.0+

Hides the labels of any controls contained within this view.

## Declaration

```swift

```

## Discussion

Use this modifier when you want to omit a label from one or more controls in your user interface. For example, the first [Toggle](../toggle.md) in the following example hides its label:

```swift
VStack {
    Toggle(isOn: $toggle1) {
        Text("Toggle 1")
    }
    .labelsHidden()

    Toggle(isOn: $toggle2) {
        Text("Toggle 2")
    }
}
```

The [VStack](../vstack.md) in the example above centers the first toggle’s control element in the available space, while it centers the second toggle’s combined label and control element:

Always provide a label for controls, even when you hide the label, because SwiftUI uses labels for other purposes, including accessibility.

> **Note**

> This modifier doesn’t work for all labels. It applies to labels that are separate from the rest of the control’s interface, like they are for [Toggle](../toggle.md), but not to controls like a bordered button where the label is inside the button’s border.
