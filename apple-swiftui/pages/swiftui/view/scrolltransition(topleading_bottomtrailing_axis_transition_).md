# scrollTransition(topLeading:bottomTrailing:axis:transition:)

**Framework:** SwiftUI  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 17.0+ · iPadOS 17.0+ · Mac Catalyst 17.0+ · macOS 14.0+ · tvOS 17.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 10.0+

Applies the given transition, animating between the phases of the transition as this view appears and disappears within the visible region of the containing scroll view.

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated func scrollTransition(topLeading: ScrollTransitionConfiguration, bottomTrailing: ScrollTransitionConfiguration, axis: Axis? = nil, transition: @escaping @Sendable (EmptyVisualEffect, ScrollTransitionPhase) -> some VisualEffect) -> some View

```

## Parameters

- `topLeading`: The configuration that drives the transition when the view is about to appear at the top edge of a vertical scroll view, or the leading edge of a horizont scroll view.
- `bottomTrailing`: The configuration that drives the transition when the view is about to appear at the bottom edge of a vertical scroll view, or the trailing edge of a horizont scroll view.
- `axis`: The axis of the containing scroll view over which the transition will be applied. The default value of `nil` uses the axis of the innermost containing scroll view, or `.vertical` if the innermost scroll view is scrollable along both axes.
- `transition`: The transition to apply.
