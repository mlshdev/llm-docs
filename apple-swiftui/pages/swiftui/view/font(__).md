## Discussion

Use `font(_:)` to apply a specific font to all of the text in a view.

The example below shows the effects of applying fonts to individual views and to view hierarchies. Font information flows down the view hierarchy as part of the environment, and remains in effect unless overridden at the level of an individual view or view container.

Here, the outermost [VStack](../vstack.md) applies a 16-point system font as a default font to views contained in that [VStack](../vstack.md). Inside that stack, the example applies a [largeTitle](../font/largetitle.md) font to just the first text view; this explicitly overrides the default. The remaining stack and the views contained with it continue to use the 16-point system font set by their containing view:

```swift
VStack {
    Text("Font applied to a text view.")
        .font(.largeTitle)

    VStack {
        Text("These 2 text views have the same font")
        Text("applied to their parent hierarchy")
    }
}
.font(.system(size: 16, weight: .light, design: .default))
```
