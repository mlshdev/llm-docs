**Availability:** iOS 13.4+ · iPadOS 13.4+ · Mac Catalyst 13.4+ · macOS 10.15+ · visionOS 1.0+

Activates this view as the source of a drag and drop operation.

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated func onDrag(_ data: @escaping () -> NSItemProvider) -> some View

```

## Parameters

- `data`: A closure that returns a single [NSItemProvider](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsitemprovider) that represents the draggable data from this view.

## Return Value

A view that activates this view as the source of a drag and drop operation, beginning with user gesture input.

## Discussion

Applying the `onDrag(_:)` modifier adds the appropriate gestures for drag and drop to this view. When a drag operation begins, a rendering of this view is generated and used as the preview image.

To customize the default preview, apply a [contentShape(\_:\_:eoFill:)](contentshape%28____eofill_%29.md) with a [dragPreview](../contentshapekinds/dragpreview.md) kind. For example, you can change the preview’s corner radius or use a nested view as the preview.

If you want to show a different preview, you can use [onDrag(\_:preview:)](ondrag%28__preview_%29.md).

To use `Transferable` types directly and access a richer feature set — including multi-item drag via [dragContainer(for:in:\_:)](dragcontainer%28for_in___%29.md) — use [draggable(\_:)](draggable%28__%29.md) instead.

> **Important**

> Don’t dispatch work to the main actor while exporting the item. Doing so isn’t supported and might cause a hang. If you register data representations on the item provider yourself, make sure their completion handlers don’t dispatch to the main thread.
