# gesture(\_:isEnabled:)

**Framework:** SwiftUI  
**Kind:** Instance Method

Attaches a gesture to the view with a lower precedence than gestures defined by the view.

## Declaration

```swift

```

## Parameters

- `isEnabled`: Whether the added gesture is enabled.

## Discussion

Use this method when you need to attach a gesture to a view. The example below defines a custom gesture that prints a message to the console and attaches it to the view’s [VStack](../vstack.md). Inside the [VStack](../vstack.md) a red heart [Image](../image.md) defines its own [TapGesture](../tapgesture.md) handler that also prints a message to the console, and blue rectangle with no custom gesture handlers. Tapping or clicking the image prints a message to the console from the tap gesture handler on the image, while tapping or clicking  the rectangle inside the [VStack](../vstack.md) prints a message in the console from the enclosing vertical stack gesture handler.

You can also use the `isEnabled` parameter to conditionally disable the gesture.

```swift
struct GestureExample: View {
    @State private var message = "Message"
    var isGestureEnabled: Bool
    let newGesture = TapGesture().onEnded {
        print("Tap on VStack.")
    }

    var body: some View {
        VStack(spacing:25) {
            Image(systemName: "heart.fill")
                .resizable()
                .frame(width: 75, height: 75)
                .padding()
                .foregroundColor(.red)
                .onTapGesture {
                    print("Tap on image.")
                }
            Rectangle()
                .fill(Color.blue)
        }
        .gesture(newGesture, isEnabled: isGestureEnabled)
        .frame(width: 200, height: 200)
        .border(Color.purple)
    }
}
```
