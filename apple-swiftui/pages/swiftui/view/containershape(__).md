## Discussion

The example below defines a view that shows its content with a rounded rectangle background and the same container shape. Any [ContainerRelativeShape](../containerrelativeshape.md) within the `content` matches the rounded rectangle shape from this container inset as appropriate. Any [ConcentricRectangle](../concentricrectangle.md) within the `content` will match the corners to be concentric to the container corners.

```swift
struct PlatterContainer<Content: View> : View {
    @ContentBuilder var content: Content
    var body: some View {
        content
            .padding()
            .containerShape(shape)
            .background(shape.fill(.background))
    }
    var shape: RoundedRectangle { RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 20) }
}
```
