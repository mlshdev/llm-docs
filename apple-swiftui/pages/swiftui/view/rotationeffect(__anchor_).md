# rotationEffect(\_:anchor:)

**Framework:** SwiftUI  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 13.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 6.0+

Rotates a view’s rendered output in two dimensions around the specified point.

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated func rotationEffect(_ angle: Angle, anchor: UnitPoint = .center) -> some View

```

## Parameters

- `angle`: The angle by which to rotate the view.
- `anchor`: A unit point within the view about which to perform the rotation. The default value is [center](../unitpoint/center.md).

## Return Value

A view with rotated content.

## Discussion

This modifier rotates the view’s content around the axis that points out of the xy-plane. It has no effect on the view’s frame. The following code rotates text by 22˚ and then draws a border around the modified view to show that the frame remains unchanged by the rotation modifier:

```swift
Text("Rotation by passing an angle in degrees")
    .rotationEffect(.degrees(22))
    .border(Color.gray)
```

The center of the box and the center of the text are aligned.](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.SwiftUI/SwiftUI-View-rotationEffect@2x.png)
