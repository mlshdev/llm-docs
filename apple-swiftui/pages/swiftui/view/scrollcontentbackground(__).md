# scrollContentBackground(\_:)

**Framework:** SwiftUI  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 16.0+ · iPadOS 16.0+ · Mac Catalyst 16.0+ · macOS 13.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 9.0+

Specifies the visibility of the background for scrollable views within this view.

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated func scrollContentBackground(_ visibility: Visibility) -> some View

```

## Parameters

- `visibility`: The visibility to use for the background.

<a id="discussion"></a>

## Discussion

The following example hides the standard system background of the List.

```swift
List {
    Text("One")
    Text("Two")
    Text("Three")
}
.scrollContentBackground(.hidden)
```

On macOS 15.0 and later, the visibility of the scroll background helps achieve the seamless window/titlebar appearance for scroll views that fill the window’s content view, or a pane’s full width and height. `List` and `Form` have the seamless appearance by default, configurable by hiding the scroll background. `ScrollView` can become seamless by making the background visible.
