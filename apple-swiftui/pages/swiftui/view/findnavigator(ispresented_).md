# findNavigator(isPresented:)

**Framework:** SwiftUI  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 16.0+ · iPadOS 16.0+ · Mac Catalyst 16.0+ · macOS 26.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

Programmatically presents the find and replace interface for text editor views.

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated func findNavigator(isPresented: Binding<Bool>) -> some View

```

## Parameters

- `isPresented`: A binding to a Boolean value that controls the presentation of the find and replace interface.

<a id="return-value"></a>

## Return Value

A view that presents the find and replace interface when `isPresented` is `true`.

<a id="discussion"></a>

## Discussion

Add this modifier to a [TextEditor](../texteditor.md), or to a view hierarchy that contains at least one text editor, to control the presentation of the find and replace interface. When you set the `isPresented` binding to `true`, the system shows the interface, and when you set it to `false`, the system hides the interface. The following example shows and hides the interface based on the state of a toolbar button:

```swift
TextEditor(text: $text)
    .findNavigator(isPresented: $isPresented)
    .toolbar {
        Toggle(isOn: $isPresented) {
            Label("Find", systemImage: "magnifyingglass")
        }
    }
```

The find and replace interface allows people to search for instances of a specified string in the text editor, and optionally to replace instances of the search string with another string. They can also show and hide the interface using built-in controls, like menus and keyboard shortcuts. SwiftUI updates `isPresented` to reflect the users’s actions.

If the text editor view isn’t currently in focus, the system still presents the find and replace interface when you set `isPresented` to `true`. If the view hierarchy contains multiple editors, the one that shows the find and replace interface is nondeterministic.

You can disable the find and replace interface for a text editor by applying the [findDisabled(\_:)](finddisabled%28__%29.md) modifier to the editor. If you do that, setting this modifier’s `isPresented` binding to `true` has no effect, but only if the disabling modifier appears closer to the text editor, like this:

```swift
TextEditor(text: $text)
    .findDisabled(isDisabled)
    .findNavigator(isPresented: $isPresented)
```
