# coordinateSpace(\_:)

**Framework:** SwiftUI  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 17.0+ · iPadOS 17.0+ · Mac Catalyst 17.0+ · macOS 14.0+ · tvOS 17.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 10.0+

Assigns a name to the view’s coordinate space, so other code can operate on dimensions like points and sizes relative to the named space.

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated func coordinateSpace(_ name: NamedCoordinateSpace) -> some View

```

## Parameters

- `name`: A name used to identify this coordinate space.

## Discussion

Use `coordinateSpace(_:)` to allow another function to find and operate on a view and operate on dimensions relative to that view.

The example below demonstrates how a nested view can find and operate on its enclosing view’s coordinate space:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var location = CGPoint.zero

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Color.red.frame(width: 100, height: 100)
                .overlay(circle)
            Text("Location: \(Int(location.x)), \(Int(location.y))")
        }
        .coordinateSpace(.named("stack"))
    }

    var circle: some View {
        Circle()
            .frame(width: 25, height: 25)
            .gesture(drag)
            .padding(5)
    }

    var drag: some Gesture {
        DragGesture(coordinateSpace: .named("stack"))
            .onChanged { info in location = info.location }
    }
}
```

Here, the [VStack](../vstack.md) in the `ContentView` named “stack” is composed of a red frame with a custom [Circle](../circle.md) view [overlay(\_:alignment:)](overlay%28__alignment_%29.md) at its center.

The `circle` view has an attached [DragGesture](../draggesture.md) that targets the enclosing VStack’s coordinate space. As the gesture recognizer’s closure registers events inside `circle` it stores them in the shared `location` state variable and the [VStack](../vstack.md) displays the coordinates in a [Text](../text.md) view.
