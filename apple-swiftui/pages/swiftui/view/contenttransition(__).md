# contentTransition(\_:)

**Framework:** SwiftUI  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 16.0+ · iPadOS 16.0+ · Mac Catalyst 16.0+ · macOS 13.0+ · tvOS 16.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 9.0+

Modifies the view to use a given transition as its method of animating changes to the contents of its views.

## Declaration

```swift
@export(implementation) nonisolated func contentTransition(_ transition: ContentTransition) -> some View

```

## Parameters

- `transition`: The transition to apply when animating the content change.

## Discussion

This modifier allows you to perform a transition that animates a change within a single view. The provided [ContentTransition](../contenttransition.md) can present an opacity animation for content changes, an interpolated animation of the content’s paths as they change, or perform no animation at all.

> **Tip**

> The `contentTransition(_:)` modifier only has an effect within the context of an [Animation](../animation.md).

In the following example, a [Button](../button.md) changes the color and font size of a [Text](../text.md) view. Since both of these properties apply to the paths of the text, the [interpolate](../contenttransition/interpolate.md) transition can animate a gradual change to these properties through the entire transition. By contrast, the [opacity](../contenttransition/opacity.md) transition would simply fade between the start and end states.

```swift
private static let font1 = Font.system(size: 20)
private static let font2 = Font.system(size: 45)

@State private var color = Color.red
@State private var currentFont = font1

var body: some View {
    VStack {
        Text("Content transition")
            .foregroundColor(color)
            .font(currentFont)
            .contentTransition(.interpolate)
        Spacer()
        Button("Change") {
            withAnimation(Animation.easeInOut(duration: 5.0)) {
                color = (color == .red) ? .green : .red
                currentFont = (currentFont == font1) ? font2 : font1
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This example uses an ease-in–ease-out animation with a five-second duration to make it easier to see the effect of the interpolation. The figure below shows the `Text` at the beginning of the animation, halfway through, and at the end.

To control whether content transitions use GPU-accelerated rendering, set the value of the [contentTransitionAddsDrawingGroup](../environmentvalues/contenttransitionaddsdrawinggroup.md) environment variable.
