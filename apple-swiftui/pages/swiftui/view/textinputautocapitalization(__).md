## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated func textInputAutocapitalization(_ autocapitalization: TextInputAutocapitalization?) -> some View

## Discussion

Use `textInputAutocapitalization(_:)` when you need to automatically capitalize words, sentences, or other text like proper nouns.

In example below, as the user enters text the shift key is automatically enabled before every word:

```swift
TextField("Last, First", text: $fullName)
    .textInputAutocapitalization(.words)
```

The [TextInputAutocapitalization](../textinputautocapitalization.md) struct defines the available autocapitalizing behavior. Providing `nil` to  this view modifier does not change the autocapitalization behavior. The default is `TextInputAutocapitalization.sentences`.
