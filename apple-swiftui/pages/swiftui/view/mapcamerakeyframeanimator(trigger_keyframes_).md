Uses the given keyframes to animate the camera of a `Map` when the given trigger value changes.

## Declaration

@MainActor @preconcurrency func mapCameraKeyframeAnimator(trigger: some Equatable, @KeyframesBuilder<MapCamera> keyframes: @escaping (MapCamera) -> some Keyframes<MapCamera>) -> some View

```

- `keyframes`: A keyframes builder closure that is called when starting a new keyframe animation. The current map camera is provided as the only parameter.

## Discussion

When the trigger value changes, the map calls the `keyframes` closure to generate the keyframes that will animate the camera. The animation will continue for the duration of the keyframes that you specify.

If the user performs a gesture while the animation is in progress, the animation will be immediately removed, allowing the interaction to take control of the camera.
