# perspectiveRotationEffect(\_:axis:anchor:anchorZ:perspective:)

**Framework:** SwiftUI  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** visionOS 1.0+

Renders a view’s content as if it’s rotated in three dimensions around the specified axis.

## Declaration

```swift
@export(implementation) nonisolated func perspectiveRotationEffect(_ angle: Angle, axis: (x: CGFloat, y: CGFloat, z: CGFloat), anchor: UnitPoint = .center, anchorZ: CGFloat = 0, perspective: CGFloat = 1) -> some View

```

## Parameters

- `angle`: The angle by which to rotate the view’s content.
- `axis`: The axis of rotation, specified as a tuple with named elements for each of the three spatial dimensions.
- `anchor`: A two dimensional unit point within the view about which to perform the rotation. The default value is [center](../unitpoint/center.md).
- `anchorZ`: The location on the z-axis around which to rotate the content. The default is `0`.
- `perspective`: The relative vanishing point for the rotation. The default is `1`.

## Discussion

Use this method to create the effect of rotating a view in three dimensions around a specified axis of rotation. The modifier projects the rotated, two-dimensional content onto the original view’s plane. Use the `perspective` input to control the renderer’s vanishing point. The following example creates the appearance of rotating text 45˚ about the y-axis:

```swift
Text("Rotation by passing an angle in degrees")
    .perspectiveRotationEffect(
        .degrees(45),
        axis: (x: 0.0, y: 1.0, z: 0.0),
        anchor: .center,
        anchorZ: 0,
        perspective: 1)
    .border(Color.gray)
```

![A screenshot of text in a grey box. The text says Rotation by passing an angle in degrees. The text is rendered in a way that makes it appear farther from the viewer on the right side and closer on the left, as if the text is angled to face someone sitting on the viewer’s right.](https://developer.apple.com/images/com.apple.SwiftUI/SwiftUI-View-rotation3DEffect@2x.png)

> **Important**

> To truly rotate a view in three dimensions, use a 3D rotation modifier without a perspective input like [rotation3DEffect(\_:axis:anchor:)](rotation3deffect%28__axis_anchor_%29.md).
