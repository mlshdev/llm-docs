# buttonRepeatBehavior(\_:)

**Framework:** SwiftUI  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 17.0+ · iPadOS 17.0+ · Mac Catalyst 17.0+ · macOS 14.0+ · tvOS 17.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 10.0+

Sets whether buttons in this view should repeatedly trigger their actions on prolonged interactions.

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated func buttonRepeatBehavior(_ behavior: ButtonRepeatBehavior) -> some View

```

## Parameters

- `behavior`: A value of `enabled` means that buttons should enable repeating behavior and a value of `disabled` means that buttons should disallow repeating behavior.

## Discussion

Apply this to buttons that increment or decrement a value or perform some other inherently iterative operation. Interactions such as pressing-and-holding on the button, holding the button’s keyboard shortcut, or holding down the space key while the button is focused will trigger this repeat behavior.

```swift
Button {
    playbackSpeed.advance(by: 1)
} label: {
    Label("Speed up", systemImage: "hare")
}
.buttonRepeatBehavior(.enabled)
```

This affects all system button styles, as well as automatically affects custom `ButtonStyle` conforming types. This does not automatically apply to custom `PrimitiveButtonStyle` conforming types, and the `EnvironmentValues.buttonRepeatBehavior` value should be used to adjust their custom gestures as appropriate.
