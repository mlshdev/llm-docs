# layoutPriority(\_:)

**Framework:** SwiftUI  
**Kind:** Instance Method  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 13.0+ · visionOS 1.0+ · watchOS 6.0+

Sets the priority by which a parent layout should apportion space to this child.

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated func layoutPriority(_ value: Double) -> some View

```

## Parameters

- `value`: The priority by which a parent layout apportions space to the child.

## Discussion

Views typically have a default priority of `0` which causes space to be apportioned evenly to all sibling views. Raising a view’s layout priority encourages the higher priority view to shrink later when the group is shrunk and stretch sooner when the group is stretched.

```swift
HStack {
    Text("This is a moderately long string.")
        .font(.largeTitle)
        .border(Color.gray)

    Spacer()

    Text("This is a higher priority string.")
        .font(.largeTitle)
        .layoutPriority(1)
        .border(Color.gray)
}
```

In the example above, the first [Text](../text.md) element has the default priority `0` which causes its view to shrink dramatically due to the higher priority of the second [Text](../text.md) element, even though all of their other attributes (font, font size and character count) are the same.

A parent layout offers the child views with the highest layout priority all the space offered to the parent minus the minimum space required for all its lower-priority children.
