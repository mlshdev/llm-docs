# init(\_:id:selection:rowContent:)

**Framework:** SwiftUI  
**Kind:** Initializer  
**Availability:** iOS 13.0+ · iPadOS 13.0+ · Mac Catalyst 13.0+ · macOS 10.15+ · tvOS 13.0+ · visionOS 1.0+

Creates a list that identifies its rows based on a key path to the identifier of the underlying data, optionally allowing users to select a single row.

## Declaration

```swift
@export(implementation) nonisolated init<Data, ID, RowContent>(_ data: Binding<Data>, id: KeyPath<Data.Element, ID>, selection: Binding<SelectionValue?>?, @ContentBuilder rowContent: @escaping (Binding<Data.Element>) -> RowContent) where Content == ForEach<LazyMapSequence<Data.Indices, (Data.Index, ID)>, ID, RowContent>, Data : MutableCollection, Data : RandomAccessCollection, ID : Hashable, RowContent : View, Data.Index : Hashable
```

## Parameters

- `data`: The data for populating the list.
- `id`: The key path to the data model’s identifier.
- `selection`: A binding to a selected value.
- `rowContent`: A content builder that creates the view for a single row of the list.
