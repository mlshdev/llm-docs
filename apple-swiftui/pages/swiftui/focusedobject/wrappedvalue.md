## Discussion

This property provides primary access to the value’s data. However, you don’t access `wrappedValue` directly. Instead, you use the property variable created with the [FocusedObject](../focusedobject.md) attribute.

When a mutable value changes, the new value is immediately available. However, a view displaying the value is updated asynchronously and may not show the new value immediately.

### Getting the value

- [projectedValue](projectedvalue.md): A projection of the focused object that creates bindings to its properties using dynamic member lookup.
- [FocusedObject.Wrapper](wrapper.md): A wrapper around the underlying focused object that can create bindings to its properties using dynamic member lookup.
