Creates a picker that generates its label from a localized string key and system image.

## Declaration

```swift
@export(implementation) nonisolated init(_ titleKey: LocalizedStringKey, systemImage: String, selection: Binding<SelectionValue>, @ContentBuilder content: () -> Content)
```

## Parameters

- `titleKey`: A localized string key that describes the purpose of selecting an option.

- `selection`: A binding to a property that determines the currently-selected option.
- `content`: A view that contains the set of options.

## Discussion

This initializer creates a [Text](../text.md) view on your behalf, and treats the localized key similar to [init(\_:tableName:bundle:comment:)](../text/init%28__tablename_bundle_comment_%29.md). See [Text](../text.md) for more information about localizing strings.
