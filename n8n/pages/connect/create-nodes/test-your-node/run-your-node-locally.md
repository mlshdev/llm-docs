# Run your node locally <a id="run-your-node-locally"></a>

You can test your node as you build it by running it in a local n8n instance with the [`n8n-node` tool](https://docs.n8n.io/connect/create-nodes/build-your-node/using-the-n8n-node-tool). `n8n-node` includes n8n, so you don't need a global n8n installation.

1. In your project's root directory, run the `dev` command:
   ```shell
   npm run dev
   ```
   This runs `n8n-node dev`, which builds your node, links it into the n8n custom nodes directory, starts a local n8n instance with your node loaded, and rebuilds your node when you change a file.

> **Info**
> **Custom nodes directory**
>
> `n8n-node dev` uses its own n8n user folder, `.n8n-node-cli`, so it doesn't touch an existing n8n installation. The default location depends on your operating system:
>
> - For Windows: `C:\Users\<username>\.n8n-node-cli\.n8n\custom`
> - For Linux: `/home/<username>/.n8n-node-cli/.n8n/custom`
> - For macOS: `/Users/<username>/.n8n-node-cli/.n8n/custom`
>
> To test against an n8n instance you run yourself, pass `--external-n8n` and set `--custom-user-folder <path>` to that instance's user folder (the parent of its `.n8n` directory). Set `N8N_DEV_RELOAD=true` on that instance so it picks up your changes.
>
> Note: `.n8n-node-cli` and `.n8n` are hidden folders, so your file browser may not show them.

2. Open `http://localhost:5678` in your browser and sign in to your n8n instance.
3. Open a workflow and search for your node in the nodes panel.

> **Info**
> **Node names**
>
> Make sure you search using the node name, not the package name. For example, if your npm package name is `n8n-nodes-weather-nodes`, and the package contains nodes named `rain`, `sun`, `snow`, you should search for `rain`, not `weather-nodes`.

Add the node to your workflow and test it as you develop. To stop n8n, press `ctrl` + `c`.
