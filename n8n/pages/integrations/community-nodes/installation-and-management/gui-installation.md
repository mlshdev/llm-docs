# GUI installation

> **Info**
> **Owner and Admin users only**

> Only users with an Owner or Admin role can install and manage community nodes from npm on a self-hosted n8n instance. The instance owner is the person who sets up and manages user management.

## Install a community node <a id="install-a-community-node"></a>

To install a community node from npm:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Community Nodes**.
2. Select **Install**.
3. Find the node you want to install:
   1. Select **Browse**. n8n takes you to an npm search results page, showing all npm packages tagged with the keyword `n8n-community-node-package`.
   2. Browse the list of results. You can filter the results or add more keywords.
   3. Once you find the package you want, make a note of the package name. If you want to install a specific version, make a note of the version number as well.
   4. Return to n8n.
4. Enter the npm package name, and optionally a version number or dist-tag. For example, consider a community node designed to access a weather API called "Storms." The package name is n8n-node-storms, and it has three major versions.<br>

   - To install the latest version of a package called n8n-node-weather: enter `n8n-nodes-storms` in **Enter npm package name**.
   - To install version 2.3: enter `n8n-node-storms@2.3` in **Enter npm package name**.
   - To install from a dist-tag such as `beta`: enter `n8n-node-storms@beta` in **Enter npm package name**. You can use any [npm dist-tag](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/commands/npm-dist-tag) published by the package author, such as `beta`, `next`, or `latest`.

   > **Info**
   > **Dist-tags resolve once at install time**
   >
   > When you install a package using a dist-tag, n8n resolves the tag to its current version at that moment. Future updates don't follow the dist-tag. For example, if you install `n8n-node-storms@beta` and `beta` points to version `2.0.0-beta.1`, n8n installs that specific version. Later updates compare against the installed semver version, not the `beta` tag.
5. Agree to the [risks](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/risks) of using community nodes: select **I understand the risks of installing unverified code from a public source.**
6. Select **Install**. n8n installs the node, and returns to the **Community Nodes** list in **Settings**.

> **Info**
> **Nodes on the blocklist**
>
> n8n maintains a blocklist of community nodes that it prevents you from installing. Refer to [n8n community node blocklist](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/blocklist) for more information.

## Uninstall a community node <a id="uninstall-a-community-node"></a>

2. On the node you want to install, select **Options** !\[Three dots options menu]\(../../.gitbook/assets/three-dot-options-menu (2).png).
3. Select **Uninstall package**.
4. Select **Uninstall Package** in the confirmation modal.

## Upgrade a community node <a id="upgrade-a-community-node"></a>

> **Warning**
> **Breaking changes in versions**
>
> Node developers may introduce breaking changes in new versions of their nodes. A breaking change is an update that breaks previous functionality. Depending on the node versioning approach that a node developer chooses, upgrading to a version with a breaking change could cause all workflows using the node to break. Be careful when upgrading your nodes. If you find that an upgrade causes issues, you can [downgrade](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/installation-and-management/gui-installation#downgrade-a-community-node).

\### Upgrade to the latest version

You can upgrade community nodes to the latest version from the node list in **Settings** > **community nodes**.

When a new version of a community node is available, n8n displays an **Update** button on the node. Click the button to upgrade to the latest version.

### Upgrade to a specific version <a id="upgrade-to-a-specific-version"></a>

To upgrade to a specific version (a version other than the latest), uninstall the node, then reinstall it, making sure to specify the target version. Follow the [Installation](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/installation-and-management/gui-installation#install-a-community-node) instructions for more guidance.

## Downgrade a community node <a id="downgrade-a-community-node"></a>

If there is a problem with a particular version of a community node, you may want to roll back to a previous version.

To do this, uninstall the community node, then reinstall it, targeting a specific node version. Follow the [Installation](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/installation-and-management/gui-installation#install-a-community-node) instructions for more guidance.
