# Risks when using community nodes <a id="risks-when-using-community-nodes"></a>

Installing community nodes from npm means you are installing unverified code from a public source into your n8n instance. This has some risks.

Risks include:

- System security: community nodes have full access to the machine that n8n runs on, and can do anything, including malicious actions.
- Data security: any community node that you use has access to data in your workflows.
- Breaking changes: node developers may introduce breaking changes in new versions of their nodes. A breaking change is an update that breaks previous functionality. Depending on the node versioning approach that a node developer chooses, upgrading to a version with a breaking change could cause all workflows using the node to break. Be careful when upgrading your nodes.

> **Info**
> **n8n vets verified community nodes**

> In addition to publicly available community nodes from npm, n8n inspects some nodes and makes them available as [verified community node inside the nodes panel](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/installation-and-management/install-verified-community-nodes). These nodes have to meet a set of data and system security requirements for approval.

## Report bad community nodes <a id="report-bad-community-nodes"></a>

You can report bad community nodes to \[<security@n8n.io>]\(mailto: <security@n8n.io>)

## Disable community nodes <a id="disable-community-nodes"></a>

If you are self-hosting n8n, you can disable community nodes by setting `N8N_COMMUNITY_PACKAGES_ENABLED` to `false`. On n8n cloud, visit the [Cloud Admin Panel](https://docs.n8n.io/deploy/use-n8n-cloud/use-the-admin-dashboard) and disable community nodes from there. See [troubleshooting](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/troubleshooting) for more information.
