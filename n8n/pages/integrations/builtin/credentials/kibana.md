# Kibana credentials <a id="kibana-credentials"></a>

You can use these credentials to authenticate when using the [HTTP Request node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest) to make a [Custom API call](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/custom-api-actions-for-existing-nodes).

## Prerequisites <a id="prerequisites"></a>

- Create an [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) account.
- If you're creating a new account to test with, load some sample data into Kibana. Refer to the [Kibana quick start](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/get-started.html) for more information.

## Supported authentication methods <a id="supported-authentication-methods"></a>

- Basic auth

## Related resources <a id="related-resources"></a>

Refer to [Kibana's API documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/api.html) for more information about the service.

This is a credential-only node. Refer to [Custom API operations](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/custom-api-actions-for-existing-nodes) to learn more. View [example workflows and related content](https://n8n.io/integrations/kibana/) on n8n's website.

## Using basic auth <a id="using-basic-auth"></a>

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- The **URL** you use to access Kibana, for example `http://localhost:5601`
- A **Username**: Use the same username that you use to log in to Elastic.
- A **Password**: Use the same password that you use to log in to Elastic.
