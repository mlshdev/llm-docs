Refer to [SurveyMonkey's API documentation](https://developer.surveymonkey.com/api/v3/#SurveyMonkey-Api) for more information about the service.

## Using API access token <a id="using-api-access-token"></a>

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- An **Access Token**: Generated once you create an app.
- A **Client ID**: Generated once you create an app.
- A **Client Secret**: Generated once you create an app.

Once you've created your app and assigned appropriate scopes, go to **Settings > Credentials**. Copy the **Access Token**, **Client ID**, and **Secret** and add them to n8n.

## Using OAuth <a id="using-oauth"></a>

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **Client ID**: Generated once you create an app.
- A **Client Secret**: Generated once you create an app.

Once you've created your app and assigned appropriate scopes:

1. Go to the app's **Settings > Settings**.
2. From n8n, copy the **OAuth Redirect URL**.
3. Overwrite the app's existing **OAuth Redirect URL** with that URL.
4. Select **Submit Changes**.
5. Be sure the **Scopes** section contains the [Required app scopes](#required-app-scopes).

From the app's **Settings > Credentials**, copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** and add them to your n8n credential. You can now select **Connect my account** from n8n.

> **Info**
> **SurveyMonkey Test OAuth Flow**
>
> This option only works if you keep the default SurveyMonkey **OAuth Redirect URL** and add the n8n OAuth Redirect URL as an **Additional Redirect URL**.

## Required app scopes <a id="required-app-scopes"></a>

Once you create your app, go to **Settings > Scopes**. Select these scopes for your n8n credential to work:

- **View Surveys**
- **View Collectors**
- **View Responses**
- **View Response Details**
- **Create/Modify Webhooks**
- **View Webhooks**

Select **Update Scopes** to save them.
