# Zammad credentials <a id="zammad-credentials"></a>

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [Zammad](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.zammad)

## Prerequisites <a id="prerequisites"></a>

- Create a hosted [Zammad](https://zammad.com/) account or set up your own Zammad instance.
- For token authentication, enable **API Token Access** in **Settings > System > API**. Refer to [Setting up a Zammad](https://admin-docs.zammad.org/en/latest/system/integrations/zabbix.html?#setting-up-a-zammad) for more information.

## Supported authentication methods <a id="supported-authentication-methods"></a>

- Basic auth
- Token auth: Zammad recommends using this authentication method.

## Related resources <a id="related-resources"></a>

Refer to [Zammad's API Authentication documentation](https://docs.zammad.org/en/latest/api/intro.html?#authentication) for more information about authenticating with the service.

## Using basic auth <a id="using-basic-auth"></a>

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **Base URL**: Enter the URL of your Zammad instance.
- An **Email** address: Enter the email address you use to log in to Zammad.
- A **Password**: Enter your Zammad password.
- **Ignore SSL Issues**: When turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL certificate validation fails.

## Using token auth <a id="using-token-auth"></a>

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **Base URL**: Enter the URL of your Zammad instance.
- An **Access Token**: Once **API Token Access** is enabled for the Zammad instance, any user with the `user_preferences.access_token` permission can generate an **Access Token** by going to your **avatar > Profile > Token Access** and **Create** a new token.
  - The access token permissions depend on what actions you'd like to complete with this credential. For all functionality within the [Zammad](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.zammad) node, select:
    - `admin.group`
    - `admin.organization`
    - `admin.user`
    - `ticket.agent`
    - `ticket.customer`
- **Ignore SSL Issues**: When turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL certificate validation fails.
