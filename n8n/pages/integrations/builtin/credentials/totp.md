# TOTP credentials <a id="totp-credentials"></a>

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [TOTP](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.totp)

## Prerequisites <a id="prerequisites"></a>

Generate a TOTP **Secret** and **Label**.

## Supported authentication methods <a id="supported-authentication-methods"></a>

- Secret and label

## Related resources <a id="related-resources"></a>

Time-based One-time Password (TOTP) is an algorithm that generates a one-time password (OTP) using the current time. Refer to [Google Authenticator | Key URI format](https://github.com/google/google-authenticator/wiki/Key-Uri-Format) for more information.

## Using secret and label <a id="using-secret-and-label"></a>

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **Secret**: The secret key encoded in the QR code during authenticator setup. It's an arbitrary key value encoded in Base32, for example: `BVDRSBXQB2ZEL5HE`. Refer to [Google Authenticator Secret](https://github.com/google/google-authenticator/wiki/Key-Uri-Format#secret) for more information.
- A **Label**: The identifier for the account. It contains an account name as a URI-encoded string. You can include prefixes to identify the provider or service managing the account. If you use prefixes, use a literal or url-encoded colon to separate the issuer prefix and the account name, for example: `GitHub:john-doe`. Refer to [Google Authenticator Label](https://github.com/google/google-authenticator/wiki/Key-Uri-Format#label) for more information.
