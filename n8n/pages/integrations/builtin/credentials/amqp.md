Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) is an open standard application layer protocol for message-oriented middleware. The defining features of AMQP are message orientation, queuing, routing, reliability and security. Refer to the [OASIS AMQP Version 1.0 Standard](https://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/amqp-core-overview-v1.0.html) for more information.

Refer to your provider's documentation for more information about the service. Refer to [ActiveMQ's API documentation](https://activemq.apache.org/components/classic/documentation/rest) as one example.
