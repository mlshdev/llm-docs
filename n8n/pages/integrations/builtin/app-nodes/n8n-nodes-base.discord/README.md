> This node can be used to enhance the capabilities of an AI agent. When used in this way, many parameters can be set automatically, or with information directed by AI - find out more in the [AI tool parameters documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/build/integrate-ai/ai-examples/use-ai-for-parameters).

## Waiting for a response <a id="waiting-for-a-response"></a>

By choosing the **Send and Wait for a Response** operation, you can send a message and pause the workflow execution until a person confirms the action or provides more information.

### Response Type <a id="response-type"></a>

You can choose between the following types of waiting and approval actions:

- **Approval**: Users can approve or disapprove from within the message.
- **Free Text**: Users can submit a response with a form.
- **Custom Form**: Users can submit a response with a custom form.

You can customize the waiting and response behavior depending on which response type you choose. You can configure these options in any of the above response types:

- **Limit Wait Time**: Whether the workflow will automatically resume execution after a specified time limit. This can be an interval or a specific wall time.
- **Append n8n Attribution**: Whether to mention in the message that it was sent automatically with n8n (turned on) or not (turned off).

### Approval response customization <a id="approval-response-customization"></a>

When using the Approval response type, you can choose whether to present only an approval button or both approval *and* disapproval buttons.

You can also customize the button labels for the buttons you include.

### Free Text response customization <a id="free-text-response-customization"></a>

When using the Free Text response type, you can customize the message button label, the form title and description, and the response button label.

### Custom Form response customization <a id="custom-form-response-customization"></a>

When using the Custom Form response type, you build a form using the fields and options you want.

You can customize each form element with the settings outlined in the [n8n Form trigger's form elements](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.formtrigger#form-elements). To add more fields, select the **Add Form Element** button.

You'll also be able to customize the message button label, the form title and description, and the response button label.
