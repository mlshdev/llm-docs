# Action Network node <a id="action-network-node"></a>

Use the Action Network node to automate work in Action Network, and integrate Action Network with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Action Network features, including creating, updating, and deleting events, people, tags, and signatures.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Action Network node supports, and links to more resources.

> **Info**
> **Credentials**

> Refer to [Action Network credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/actionnetwork) for guidance on setting up authentication.

> **Info**
> **This node can be used as an AI tool**
>
> This node can be used to enhance the capabilities of an AI agent. When used in this way, many parameters can be set automatically, or with information directed by AI - find out more in the [AI tool parameters documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/build/integrate-ai/ai-examples/use-ai-for-parameters).

## What to do if your operation isn't supported <a id="what-to-do-if-your-operation-isnt-supported"></a>

If this node doesn't support the operation you want to do, you can use the [HTTP Request node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest) to call the service's API.

You can use the credential you created for this service in the HTTP Request node:

1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Authentication** > **Predefined Credential Type**.
2. Select the service you want to connect to.
3. Select your credential.

Refer to [Custom API operations](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/custom-api-actions-for-existing-nodes) for more information.
