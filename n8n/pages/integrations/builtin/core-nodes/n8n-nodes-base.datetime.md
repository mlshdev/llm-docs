# Date & Time <a id="date-and-time"></a>

The Date & Time node manipulates date and time data and convert it to different formats.

> **Info**
> **Timezone settings**
>
> The node relies on the timezone setting. n8n uses either:
>
> 1. The workflow timezone, if set. Refer to [Workflow settings](https://docs.n8n.io/build/manage-workflows/configure-workflow-settings) for more information.
> 2. The n8n instance timezone, if the workflow timezone isn't set. The default is `America/New York` for self-hosted instances. n8n Cloud tries to detect the instance owner's timezone when they sign up, falling back to GMT as the default. Self-hosted users can change the instance setting using [Environment variables](https://docs.n8n.io/deploy/host-n8n/configure-n8n/basic-configuration/use-environment-variables/timezone-and-localization). Cloud admins can change the instance timezone in the [Admin dashboard](https://docs.n8n.io/deploy/use-n8n-cloud/configure-cloud/set-your-timezone).

> **Info**
> **Date and time in other nodes**
>
> You can work with data and time in the Code node, and in expressions in any node. n8n supports Luxon to help work with date and time in JavaScript. Refer to [Date and time with Luxon](https://docs.n8n.io/build/work-with-data/handle-special-data-types/work-with-dates-and-times) for more information.

- **Format**: Select the format you want to change the date to. Choose from:
  - **Custom Format**: Enter your own custom format using Luxon's [special tokens](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/formatting?id=table-of-tokens). Tokens are case-sensitive.
  - **MM/DD/YYYY**: For `4 September 1986`, this formats the date as `09/04/1986`.
  - **YYYY/MM/DD**: For `4 September 1986`, this formats the date as `1986/09/04`.
  - **MMMM DD YYYY**: For `4 September 1986`, this formats the date as `September 04 1986`.
  - **MM-DD-YYYY**: For `4 September 1986`, this formats the date as `09-04-1986`.
  - **YYYY-MM-DD**: For `4 September 1986`, this formats the date as `1986-09-04`.
- **Output Field Name**: Enter the name of the field to output the formatted date to.

### Format a Date options <a id="format-a-date-options"></a>

This operation includes these options:

- **Include Input Fields**: If you'd like to include all of the input fields in the output, turn this option on. If turned off, only the **Output Field Name** and its contents are output.
- **From Date Format**: If the node isn't recognizing the **Date** format correctly, enter the format for that **Date** here so the node can process it properly. Use Luxon's [special tokens](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/formatting?id=table-of-tokens) to enter the format. Tokens are case-sensitive
- **Use Workflow Timezone**: Whether to use the input's time zone (turned off) or the workflow's timezone (turned on).

## Get Current Date <a id="get-current-date"></a>

Configure the node for this operation using these parameters:

- **Include Current Time**: Choose whether to include the current time (turned on) or to set the time to midnight (turned off).
- **Output Field Name**: Enter the name of the field to output the current date to.

### Get Current Date options <a id="get-current-date-options"></a>

This operation includes these options:

- **Include Input Fields**: If you'd like to include all of the input fields in the output, turn this option on. If turned off, only the **Output Field Name** and its contents are output.
- **Timezone**: Set the timezone to use. If left blank, the node uses the n8n instance's timezone.

> **Info**
> **+00:00 timezone**
>
> Use `GMT` for +00:00 timezone.

## Get Time Between Dates <a id="get-time-between-dates"></a>

Configure the node for this operation using these parameters:

- **Start Date**: Enter the earlier date you want to compare.
- **End Date**: Enter the later date you want to compare.
- **Units**: Select the units you want to calculate the time between. You can include multiple units. Choose from:
  - **Year**
  - **Month**
  - **Week**
  - **Day**
  - **Hour**
  - **Minute**
  - **Second**
  - **Millisecond**
- **Output Field Name**: Enter the name of the field to output the calculated time between to.

### Get Time Between Dates options <a id="get-time-between-dates-options"></a>

The Get Time Between Dates operation includes the **Include Input Fields** option as well as an **Output as ISO String** option. If you leave this option off, each unit you selected will return its own time difference calculation, for example:

```
timeDifference
years : 1
months : 3
days : 13
```

If you turn on the **Output as ISO String** option, the node formats the output as a single ISO duration string, for example: `P1Y3M13D`.

ISO duration format displays a format as `P<n>Y<n>M<n>DT<n>H<n>M<n>S`. `<n>` is the number for the unit after it.

- P = period (duration). It begins all ISO duration strings.
- Y = years
- M = months
- W = weeks
- D = days
- T = delineator between dates and times, used to avoid confusion between months and minutes
- H = hours
- M = minutes
- S = seconds

Milliseconds don't get their own unit, but instead are decimal seconds. For example, 2.1 milliseconds is `0.0021S`.
