The Send Email node sends emails using an SMTP email server.

> You can find authentication information for this node [here](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/send-email).

## Node parameters <a id="node-parameters"></a>

> **Info**
> **This node can be used as an AI tool**
>
> This node can be used to enhance the capabilities of an AI agent. When used in this way, many parameters can be set automatically, or with information directed by AI - find out more in the [AI tool parameters documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/build/integrate-ai/ai-examples/use-ai-for-parameters).

Configure this node using the following parameters.

### Credential to connect with <a id="credential-to-connect-with"></a>

Select or create an [SMTP account credential](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/send-email) for the node to use.

### Operation <a id="operation"></a>

The Send Email node supports the following operations:

- **Send**: Send an email.
- **Send and Wait for Response**: Send an email and wait for a response from the receiver. This operation pauses the workflow execution until the user submits a response.

Choosing **Send and Wait for Response** will activate parameters and options as discussed in [waiting for a response](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.sendemail#waiting-for-a-response).

### From Email <a id="from-email"></a>

Enter the email address you want to send the email from. You can also include a name using this format: `Name Name <email@sample.com>`, for example: `Nathan Doe <nate@n8n.io>`.

### To Email <a id="to-email"></a>

Enter the email address you want to send the email to. You can also include a name using this format: `Name Name <email@sample.com>`, for example: `Nathan Doe <nate@n8n.io>`. Use a comma to separate multiple email addresses: `first@sample.com, "Name" <second@sample.com>`.

> This email format also applies to the CC and BCC fields.

### Subject <a id="subject"></a>

Enter the subject line for the email.

You can customize each form element with the settings outlined in the [n8n Form trigger's form elements](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.formtrigger#form-elements). To add more fields, select the **Add Form Element** button.

## Limitations <a id="limitations"></a>

The Send Email (SMTP) node does not support setting headers like `In-Reply-To` and `References`, which are required for email threading. As a result, each email is treated as a new conversation instead of appearing in the same thread.

- **Workaround**: Use the Gmail node’s **Reply to a message** operation, or a custom node that supports custom headers.
