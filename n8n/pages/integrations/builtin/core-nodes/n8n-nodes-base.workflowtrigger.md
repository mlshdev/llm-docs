# Workflow Trigger node <a id="workflow-trigger-node"></a>

The Workflow Trigger node gets triggered when a workflow is updated or activated.

> **Warning**
> **Feature availability**
>
> The Workflow Trigger node is deprecated from n8n 1.64.0. n8n moved its functionality to the [n8n Trigger node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.n8ntrigger). Refer to [Deprecated and versioned nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/deprecated-nodes) for more information.

> **Info**
> **Keep in mind**
>
> If you want to use the Workflow Trigger node for a workflow, add the node to the workflow. You don't have to create a separate workflow.

The Workflow Trigger node gets triggered for the workflow that it gets added to. You can use the Workflow Trigger node to trigger a workflow to notify the state of the workflow.

## Node parameters <a id="node-parameters"></a>

The node includes a single parameter to identify the **Events** that should trigger it. Choose from these events:

- **Active Workflow Updated**: If you select this event, the node triggers when this workflow is updated.
- **Workflow Activated**: If you select this event, the node triggers when this workflow is activated.

You can select one or both of these events.
