# Execute Sub-workflow <a id="execute-sub-workflow"></a>

Use the Execute Sub-workflow node to run a different workflow on the host machine that runs n8n.

## Node parameters <a id="node-parameters"></a>

### Source <a id="source"></a>

Select where the node should get the sub-workflow's information from:

- **Database**: Select this option to load the workflow from the database by ID. You must also enter either:
  - **From list**: Select the workflow from a list of workflows available to your account.
  - **Workflow ID**: Enter the ID for the workflow. The URL of the workflow contains the ID after `/workflow/`. For example, if the URL of a workflow is `https://my-n8n-acct.app.n8n.cloud/workflow/abCDE1f6gHiJKL7`, the **Workflow ID** is `abCDE1f6gHiJKL7`.
- **Local File**: Select this option to load the workflow from a locally saved JSON file. You must also enter:
  - **Workflow Path**: Enter the path to the local JSON workflow file you want the node to execute.
- **Parameter**: Select this option to load the workflow from a parameter. You must also enter:
  - **Workflow JSON**: Enter the JSON code you want the node to execute.
- **URL**: Select this option to load the workflow from a URL. You must also enter:
  - **Workflow URL**: Enter the URL you want to load the workflow from.

### Workflow Inputs <a id="workflow-inputs"></a>

If you select a sub-workflow using the **database** and **From list** options, the sub-workflow's input items will automatically display, ready for you to fill in or map values.

You can optionally remove requested input items, in which case the sub-workflow receives `null` as the item's value. You can also enable **Attempt to convert types** to try to automatically convert data to the sub-workflow item's requested type.

Input items won't appear if the sub-workflow's Workflow Input Trigger node uses the "Accept all data" input data mode.

### Mode <a id="mode"></a>

Use this parameter to control the execution mode for the node. Choose from these options:

- **Run once with all items**: Pass all input items into a single execution of the node.
- **Run once for each item**: Execute the node once for each input item in turn.

## Node options <a id="node-options"></a>

This node includes one option: **Wait for Sub-Workflow Completion**. This lets you control whether the main workflow should wait for the sub-workflow's completion before moving on to the next step (turned on) or whether the main workflow should continue without waiting (turned off).

## Set up and use a sub-workflow <a id="set-up-and-use-a-sub-workflow"></a>

This section walks through setting up both the parent workflow and sub-workflow.

### Create the sub-workflow <a id="create-the-sub-workflow"></a>

1. Create a new workflow.<br>

   > **Info**
   > **Create sub-workflows from existing workflows**
   >
   > You can optionally create a sub-workflow directly from an existing parent workflow using the [Execute Sub-workflow](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow) node. In the node, select the **Database** and **From list** options and select **Create a sub-workflow** in the list.
   >
   > You can also extract selected nodes directly using [Sub-workflow conversion](https://docs.n8n.io/build/flow-logic/convert-to-sub-workflows) in the context menu.

2. **Optional**: configure which workflows can call the sub-workflow:
   1. Select the **Options** ![Options menu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/afebf5d9c6ff327fa215b3e6f99627e11fc9d3f2/docs/reusable-content/.gitbook/assets/three-dot-options-menu.png) menu > **Settings**. n8n opens the **Workflow settings** modal.
   2. Change the **This workflow can be called by** setting.	Refer to [Workflow settings](https://docs.n8n.io/build/manage-workflows/configure-workflow-settings) for more information on configuring your workflows.

3. Add the **Execute Sub-workflow** trigger node (if you are searching under trigger nodes, this is also titled **When Executed by Another Workflow**).

4. Set the **Input data mode** to choose how you will define the sub-workflow's input data:
   - **Define using fields below**: Choose this mode to define individual input names and data types that the calling workflow needs to provide. The [Execute Sub-workflow node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow) or [Call n8n Workflow Tool node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow) in the calling workflow will automatically pull in the fields defined here.
   - **Define using JSON example**: Choose this mode to provide an example JSON object that demonstrates the expected input items and their types.
   - **Accept all data**: Choose this mode to accept all data unconditionally. The sub-workflow won't define any required input items. This sub-workflow must handle any input inconsistencies or missing values.

5. Add other nodes as needed to build your sub-workflow functionality.

6. Save the sub-workflow.

> **Info**
> **Sub-workflow mustn't contain errors**
>
> If there are errors in the sub-workflow, the parent workflow can't trigger it.

> **Info**
> **Load data into sub-workflow before building**
>
> This requires the ability to [load data from previous executions](https://docs.n8n.io/build/understand-workflows/understand-executions/debug-executions), which is available on n8n Cloud and registered Community plans.
>
> If you want to load data into your sub-workflow to use while building it:
>
> 1. Create the sub-workflow and add the **Execute Sub-workflow Trigger**.
> 2. Set the node's **Input data mode** to **Accept all data** or define the input items using fields or JSON if they're already known.
> 3. In the sub-workflow [settings](https://docs.n8n.io/build/manage-workflows/configure-workflow-settings), set **Save successful production executions** to **Save**.
> 4. Skip ahead to setting up the parent workflow, and run it.
> 5. Follow the steps to [load data from previous executions](https://docs.n8n.io/build/understand-workflows/understand-executions/debug-executions).
> 6. Adjust the **Input data mode** to match the input sent by the parent workflow if necessary.
>
> You can now pin example data in the trigger node, enabling you to work with real data while configuring the rest of the workflow.

### Call the sub-workflow <a id="call-the-sub-workflow"></a>

1. Open the workflow where you want to call the sub-workflow.

2. Add the **Execute Sub-workflow** node.

3. In the **Execute Sub-workflow** node, set the sub-workflow you want to call. You can choose to call the workflow by ID, load a workflow from a local file, add workflow JSON as a parameter in the node, or target a workflow by URL.<br>

   > **Info**
   > **Find your workflow ID**
   >
   > Your sub-workflow's ID is the alphanumeric string at the end of its URL.

4. Fill in the required input items defined by the sub-workflow.

5. Save your workflow.

When your workflow executes, it will send data to the sub-workflow, and run it.

You can follow the execution flow from the parent workflow to the sub-workflow by opening the Execute Sub-workflow node and selecting the **View sub-execution** link. Likewise, the sub-workflow's execution contains a link back to the parent workflow's execution to navigate in the other direction.

## How data passes between workflows <a id="how-data-passes-between-workflows"></a>

As an example, imagine you have an Execute Sub-workflow node in **Workflow A**. The Execute Sub-workflow node calls another workflow called **Workflow B**:

1. The Execute Sub-workflow node passes the data to the Execute Sub-workflow Trigger node (titled "When executed by another node" in the canvas) of **Workflow B**.
2. The last node of **Workflow B** sends the data back to the Execute Sub-workflow node in **Workflow A**.
