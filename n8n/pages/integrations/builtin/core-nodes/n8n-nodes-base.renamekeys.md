# Rename Keys <a id="rename-keys"></a>

Use the Rename Keys node to rename the keys of a key-value pair in n8n.

## Node parameters <a id="node-parameters"></a>

You can rename one or multiple keys using the Rename Keys node. Select the **Add new key** button to rename a key.

For each key, enter the:

- **Current Key Name**: The current name of the key you want to rename.
- **New Key Name**: The new name you want to assign to the key.

## Node options <a id="node-options"></a>

Choose whether to use a **Regex** regular expression to identify keys to rename. To use this option, you must also enter:

- The **Regular Expression** you'd like to use.
- **Replace With**: Enter the new name you want to assign to the key(s) that match the **Regular Expression**.
- You can also choose these Regex-specific options:
  - **Case Insensitive**: Set whether the regular expression should match case (turned off) or be case insensitive (turned on).
  - **Max Depth**: Enter the maximum depth to replace keys, using `-1` for unlimited and `0` for top-level only.

> **Warning**
> **Regex impacts**
>
> Using a regular expression can affect any keys that match the expression, including keys you've already renamed.
