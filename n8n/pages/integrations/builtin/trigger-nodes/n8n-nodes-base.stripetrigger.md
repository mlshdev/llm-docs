# Stripe Trigger node <a id="stripe-trigger-node"></a>

[Stripe](https://stripe.com/) is a suite of payment APIs that powers commerce for online businesses.

The Stripe Trigger node can verify that incoming webhook requests genuinely come from Stripe.

When you set a **Signature Secret** on your [Stripe credential](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/stripe), the node checks the `Stripe-Signature` header on each request and rejects any request that's unsigned, forged, or more than five minutes old with a `401 Unauthorized` response. n8n doesn't run your workflow for rejected requests.

Without a **Signature Secret**, the node doesn't verify incoming requests, so anyone who knows your webhook URL could send forged events. n8n strongly recommends setting one. For setup steps, refer to [Verify incoming requests](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/stripe#verify-incoming-requests).
