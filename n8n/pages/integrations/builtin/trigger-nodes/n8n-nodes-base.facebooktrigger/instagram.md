## Trigger configuration <a id="trigger-configuration"></a>

To configure the trigger with this Object:

1. Select the **Credential to connect with**. Select an existing or create a new [Facebook App credential](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/facebookapp).
2. Enter the **APP ID** of the app connected to your credential. Refer to the [Facebook App credential](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/facebookapp) documentation for more information.
3. Select **Instagram** as the **Object**.
4. **Field Names or IDs**: By default, the node will trigger on all the available events using the `*` wildcard filter. If you'd like to limit the events, use the `X` to remove the star and use the dropdown or an expression to select the updates you're interested in. Options include:
   - **Comments**: Notifies you when anyone comments on an IG Media owned by your app's Instagram user.
   - **Messaging Handover**
   - **Mentions**: Notifies you whenever an Instagram user @mentions an Instagram Business or Creator Account in a comment or caption.
   - **Messages**: Notifies you when anyone messages your app's Instagram user.
   - **Messaging Seen**: Notifies you when someone sees a message sent by your app's Instagram user.
   - **Standby**
   - **Story Insights**: Notifies you one hour after a story expires with metrics describing interactions on a story.
5. In **Options**, turn on the toggle to **Include Values**. This Object type fails without the option enabled.
