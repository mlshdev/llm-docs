## Configure a webhook in TheHive <a id="configure-a-webhook-in-thehive"></a>

To configure the webhook for your TheHive instance:

1. Copy the testing and production webhook URLs from TheHive Trigger node.

2. Add the following lines to the `application.conf` file. This is TheHive configuration file:

   ```
   notification.webhook.endpoints = [
       {
           name: TESTING_WEBHOOK_NAME
           url: TESTING_WEBHOOK_URL
           version: 0
           wsConfig: {}
           includedTheHiveOrganisations: ["ORGANIZATION_NAME"]
           excludedTheHiveOrganisations: []
       },
       {
           name: PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_NAME
           url: PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_URL
           version: 0
           wsConfig: {}
           includedTheHiveOrganisations: ["ORGANIZATION_NAME"]
           excludedTheHiveOrganisations: []
       }
   ]
   ```

3. Replace `TESTING_WEBHOOK_URL` and `PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_URL` with the URLs you copied in the previous step.

4. Replace `TESTING_WEBHOOK_NAME` and `PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_NAME` with your preferred endpoint names.

5. Replace `ORGANIZATION_NAME` with your organization name.

6. Execute the following cURL command to enable notifications:
   ```sh
   curl -XPUT -uTHEHIVE_USERNAME:THEHIVE_PASSWORD -H 'Content-type: application/json' THEHIVE_URL/api/config/organisation/notification -d '
   {
       "value": [
           {
           "delegate": false,
           "trigger": { "name": "AnyEvent"},
           "notifier": { "name": "webhook", "endpoint": "TESTING_WEBHOOK_NAME" }
           },
           {
           "delegate": false,
           "trigger": { "name": "AnyEvent"},
           "notifier": { "name": "webhook", "endpoint": "PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_NAME" }
           }
       ]
   }'
   ```
