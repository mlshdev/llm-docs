# Introduction

FATE is an extended regression suite on the client-side and a means
for results aggregation and presentation on the server-side.

The first part of this document explains how you can use FATE from
your FFmpeg source directory to test your ffmpeg binary. The second
part describes how you can run FATE to submit the results to FFmpeg's
FATE server.

In any way you can have a look at the publicly viewable FATE results
by visiting this website:

<http://fate.ffmpeg.org/>

This is especially recommended for all people contributing source
code to FFmpeg, as it can be seen if some test on some platform broke
with their recent contribution. This usually happens on the platforms
the developers could not test on.

The second part of this document describes how you can run FATE to
submit your results to FFmpeg's FATE server. If you want to submit your
results be sure to check that your combination of CPU, OS and compiler
is not already listed on the above mentioned website.

In the third part you can find a comprehensive listing of FATE makefile
targets and variables.

# Using FATE from your FFmpeg source directory

If you want to run FATE on your machine, FFmpeg needs to be configured first.
You may specify the location of samples during configuration by adding the
argument `--samples=/path/to/fate-suite`.

```text
./configure --enable-somelib --samples=/path/to/fate-suite
```

After successful configuration, you need to add and/or update the samples in place:

```text
make fate-rsync
```

Now you are ready to run FATE:

```text
make fate
```

See makefile variables for a list of arguments that can be added.

If you did not set the samples path during configuration, or if you wish to
override it just before starting FATE, you can do so in one of three ways.

Either by setting a make variable:

```text
make fate-rsync SAMPLES=/path/to/fate-suite
make fate       SAMPLES=/path/to/fate-suite
```

or by setting an environment variable for the current session:

```text
export FATE_SAMPLES=/path/to/fate-suite
make fate-rsync
make fate
```

or in isolation for a single command by prepending it:

```text
FATE_SAMPLES=/path/to/fate-suite make fate-rsync
FATE_SAMPLES=/path/to/fate-suite make fate
```

This variable can also be set in your shell profile to make it permanent.

> **NOTE**
> Do not put a '\~' character in the samples path to indicate a home
> directory. Because of shell nuances, this will cause FATE to fail.
> Also, on Windows the path has to be relative to the build path
> which in this case is the FFmpeg source directory.

Beware that some assertions are disabled by default, so mind setting
`--assert-level=<level>` at configuration time, e.g. when seeking
the highest possible test coverage:

```text
./configure --assert-level=2
```

Note that raising the assert level could have a performance impact.

To get the complete list of tests, run the command:

```text
make fate-list
```

You can specify a subset of tests to run by specifying the
corresponding elements from the list with the `fate-` prefix,
e.g. as in:

```text
make fate-ffprobe_compact fate-ffprobe_xml
```

This makes it easier to run a few tests in case of failure without
running the complete test suite.

To use a custom wrapper to run the test, pass `--target-exec` to
`configure` or set the *TARGET\_EXEC* Make variable.

# Submitting the results to the FFmpeg result aggregation server

To submit your results to the server you should run fate through the
shell script `tests/fate.sh` from the FFmpeg sources. This script needs
to be invoked with a configuration file as its first argument.

```text
tests/fate.sh /path/to/fate_config
```

A configuration file template with comments describing the individual
configuration variables can be found at `doc/fate_config.sh.template`.

Create a configuration that suits your needs, based on the configuration
template. The `slot` configuration variable can be any string that is not
yet used, but it is suggested that you name it adhering to the following
pattern `*arch*-*os*-*compiler*-*compiler version*`. The
configuration file itself will be sourced in a shell script, therefore all
shell features may be used. This enables you to setup the environment as you
need it for your build.

For your first test runs the `fate_recv` variable should be empty or
commented out. This will run everything as normal except that it will omit
the submission of the results to the server. The following files should be
present in $workdir as specified in the configuration file:

- configure.log
- compile.log
- test.log
- report
- version

When you have everything working properly you can create an SSH key pair
and send the public key to the FATE server administrator who can be contacted
at the email address <fate-admin@ffmpeg.org>.

Configure your SSH client to use public key authentication with that key
when connecting to the FATE server. Also do not forget to check the identity
of the server and to accept its host key. This can usually be achieved by
running your SSH client manually and killing it after you accepted the key.
The FATE server's fingerprint is:

- RSA
  d3:f1:83:97:a4:75:2b:a6:fb:d6:e8:aa:81:93:97:51
- ECDSA
  76:9f:68:32:04:1e:d5:d4:ec:47:3f:dc:fc:18:17:86

If you have problems connecting to the FATE server, it may help to try out
the `ssh` command with one or more `-v` options. You should
get detailed output concerning your SSH configuration and the authentication
process.

The only thing left is to automate the execution of the fate.sh script and
the synchronisation of the samples directory.

# Uploading new samples to the fate suite

If you need a sample uploaded send a mail to samples-request.

This is for developers who have an account on the fate suite server.
If you upload new samples, please make sure they are as small as possible,
space on each client, network bandwidth and so on benefit from smaller test cases.
Also keep in mind older checkouts use existing sample files, that means in
practice generally do not replace, remove or overwrite files as it likely would
break older checkouts or releases.
Also all needed samples for a commit should be uploaded, ideally 24
hours, before the push.
If you need an account for frequently uploading samples or you wish to help
others by doing that send a mail to ffmpeg-devel.

```text
#First update your local samples copy:
rsync -vauL --chmod=Dg+s,Duo+x,ug+rw,o+r,o-w,+X fate-suite.ffmpeg.org:/home/samples/fate-suite/ ~/fate-suite

#Then do a dry run checking what would be uploaded:
rsync -vanL --no-g --chmod=Dg+s,Duo+x,ug+rw,o+r,o-w,+X ~/fate-suite/ fate-suite.ffmpeg.org:/home/samples/fate-suite

#Upload the files:
rsync -vaL  --no-g --chmod=Dg+s,Duo+x,ug+rw,o+r,o-w,+X ~/fate-suite/ fate-suite.ffmpeg.org:/home/samples/fate-suite
```

# FATE makefile targets and variables

## Makefile targets

- fate-rsync
  Download/synchronize sample files to the configured samples directory.

- fate-list
  Will list all fate/regression test targets.

- fate-list-failing
  List the fate tests that failed the last time they were executed.

- fate-clear-reports
  Remove the test reports from previous test executions (getting rid of
  potentially stale results from fate-list-failing).

- fate
  Run the FATE test suite (requires the fate-suite dataset).

## Makefile variables

<a id="makefile-variables"></a>

- V
  Verbosity level, can be set to 0, 1 or 2.
  - 0: show just the test arguments
  - 1: show just the command used in the test
  - 2: show everything

- SAMPLES
  Specify or override the path to the FATE samples at make time, it has a
  meaning only while running the regression tests.

- THREADS
  Specify how many threads to use while running regression tests, it is
  quite useful to detect thread-related regressions.

This variable may be set to the string "random", optionally followed by a
number, like "random99", This will cause each test to use a random number of
threads. If a number is specified, it is used as a maximum number of threads,
otherwise 16 is the maximum.

In case a test fails, the thread count used for it will be written into the
errfile.

- THREAD\_TYPE
  Specify which threading strategy test, either `slice` or `frame`,
  by default `slice+frame`

- CPUFLAGS
  Specify CPU flags.

- TARGET\_EXEC
  Specify or override the wrapper used to run the tests.
  The `TARGET_EXEC` option provides a way to run FATE wrapped in
  `valgrind`, `qemu-user` or `wine` or on remote targets
  through `ssh`.

- GEN
  Set to `1` to generate the missing or mismatched references.

- HWACCEL
  Specify which hardware acceleration to use while running regression tests,
  by default `none` is used.

- KEEP
  Set to `1` to keep temp files generated by fate test(s) when test is successful.
  Default is `0`, which removes these files. Files are always kept when a test
  fails.

## Examples

```text
make V=1 SAMPLES=/var/fate/samples THREADS=2 CPUFLAGS=mmx fate
```
